1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Alright, now let me give you a quick introduction

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
to Rider. Rider is a cross platform ID

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
built by Jet Brains, the same company that has created

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
ReSharper. It's super fast, it's light weight, and it's

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
my preferred IDE at the time of recording this video. If you want to use

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Visual Studio, that's perfectly fine, but let me show you one of my favorite features

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
in Rider, that you can also get with ReSharper, inside

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Visual Studio. Look at this icon we have

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
in front of this test method. Just click it, look,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
with Rider, or with ReSharper, we can run a single test,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and this is something we don't currently have in Visual Studio.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In Visual Studio, you can only run all the tests in your project.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
but that's very inefficient, because in a large, real world

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
application, you might have hundreds, or thousands of tests.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Sometimes you're working on a particular test, you're making changes, and you want to run

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
only that test. You don't want to run all the tests and wait

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
every time you are making a simple change, in a single test method.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Also, here we can run all the tests inside

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
this reservation test class, you can see we have this icon here,

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
so we can run all the tests inside this class.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The short cut to run this is command and T, and then command and

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
R. If you're on Windows, the short cut

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
is control T, and control R. And

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Here is our rest runner, which is faster than the test runner we get

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
in Visual Studio. So these are some of the reasons that I love

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
ReSharper, but again, you don't have to get ReSharper, Rider,

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
you can simply use Visual Studio on Windows, and that's perfectly fine.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But I'm going to use Rider for the rest of the course.

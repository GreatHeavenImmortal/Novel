00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In this section, we're going to explore

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
a few unit testing scenarios. So, you're going to learn how to test

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
methods that return a value, overlooking (?) at testing strings and

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
sections (?) more specifically, you're also going to learn how to test void

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
methods, methods that throw an exception, or raise an event,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and finally, we'll have a discussion about testing private

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and protected methods. These are all very important topics

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
in unit testing, so let's get started!

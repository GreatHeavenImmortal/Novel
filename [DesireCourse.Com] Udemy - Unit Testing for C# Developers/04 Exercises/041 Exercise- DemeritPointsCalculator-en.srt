1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Alright, now let's take a look at another exercise.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So once again in the Fundamentals folder, open up this

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
class. DemeritPointsCalculator.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So here we have one method. Calculate

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
DemeritPoints. We give it the speed of a car

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
will tell us how many DemeritPoints that driver should get for speeding.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So this is the algorithm I've implemented here.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
For every five kilometers over the speed limit,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
which is 65, we're going to give that

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
driver one point. So if the driver is 15 kilometers

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
over the speed limit, they should get three

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
DemeritPoints. So go ahead, and write unit tests for this function,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
to make sure it's implemented properly. Next we're going to look at

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
my solution.

1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:05,760
This action you learn the fundamentals of unit testing.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:11,760
You learn about the characteristics of good unit tests that they should be small have a single responsibility

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,340
and no logic.

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:19,860
They should not be too generic or too specific and they should be isolated meaning each test should

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:25,170
run using a clean fresh state as if it's the only test in the world.

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,050
You learn about water tests and what not to test for specifically you learn that you should test the

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:38,520
outcome of a function irrespective of how it's implemented and that you should not test language features

8
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,120
or third party code.

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,380
We also learn a couple of basic techniques for writing clean and maintainable tests.

10
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,420
We learn how to use the set up method to do all the initialization before or test methods and how to

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,740
write parameterize tests.

12
00:00:53,790 --> 00:01:00,900
And finally you learned about two ways to write reliable and trustworthy tests you either use test driven

13
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:06,990
development which is beyond the scope of this course or make a small change your production code that

14
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,890
should make the test fail.

15
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:16,740
If the test still passes that means test is not a trustworthy test that you can rely upon in the next

16
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,150
section.

17
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:23,010
We've been looking at the core unit testing techniques you you'll learn how to test methods that return

18
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:29,020
a string or a collection or throw an exception raised an event and other scenarios.

19
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,410
So we see in the next section.

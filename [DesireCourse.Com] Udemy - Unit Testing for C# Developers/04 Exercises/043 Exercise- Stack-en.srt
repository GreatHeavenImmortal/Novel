1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Alright, one more exercise.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This time, I want you to look at the stack class.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So here we have a basic implementation

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
of a stack, we have a few public members, we have this

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
count, which is an expression body property,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
which returns the number of objects in the stack

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
we have the push method, which adds an object on top of the stack,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
we have the Pop method, which removes the object on top of

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
the stack, and also returns it, and finally the Peek method,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that returns the object on top of the stack without

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
removing it. So, go ahead, and write a bunch of unit

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
tests for this class and next we're going to look at my solution.

Chapter 1 Nick
"You should kill yourself."
Inside a dirty alleyway filled with oily pipes, electrical wires, and broken walls, a young man sat on the ground with his back to the wall.
His head was lowered as he lifelessly stared at the ground visible between his legs.
The sun was positioned in the middle of the sky, perfectly above this boy. Because of that, the alleyway was brightly lit.
"I know that it comes as a bit of a shock, but I genuinely think the best course of action for you in this situation would be to kill yourself."
The boy didn't lift his head as he heard these words.
At this moment, a dirty and disheveled rat was sitting on top of a small rusty box made of metal. The rat was lightly scratching its snout as it looked with widely opened eyes at the boy, trying to establish eye contact.
"Listen," the rat said as it jumped down from the box and slowly walked towards the boy. "We all know what happened. It's not like I'm suggesting suicide without a logical basis, you know?"
As the rat came closer, the boy's eyes suddenly gained life, and he looked at the rat with intensity.
The rat's eyes widened, and it went on its hind legs as it slowly retreated. "Calm down, Nick. I'm not going to hurt you," it said with a nervous smile as it stopped retreating. "Look at me. I'm just a rat. How am I supposed to hurt someone that managed to get through the Zephyx Extractor Exam?"
The boy, Nick, looked back at the ground.
When Nick just lifelessly looked at the ground like that, he looked like a frail homeless person, but when he just looked at the rat, his entire demeanor changed.
In fact, Nick's body was anything but frail. While he wasn't very bulky, his muscles were pretty defined, which wasn't surprising, considering that he had trained for the last four years in hopes of finally getting out of the Dregs.
"Hey, Nick," the rat said, not daring to get any closer. "I know that you're still holding onto some hope, but we both know that believing in this fickle light of hope is just delusional."
The rat slowly moved around Nick's body, but it didn't dare to get too close to his body. "Over the last four years, you worked so hard on yourself. You trained every day, and you even committed some terrible acts just to avoid paying the Blood Tax."
"You didn't want to do these things, but you still did them. Why? Because you saw a way out of the Dregs."
"And you did it! You managed to get a spot in the Zephyx Extractor Exam for Ghosty's Lab, and you even managed to pass it!" the rat said with a lot of enthusiasm.
And then, the rat just sighed. "But your Zephyx Synchronizer was already attuned to a Specter. You managed to pass the exam, but Ghosty's Lab can't use a Zephyx Extractor with an already synchronized Zephyx Synchronizer."
"And you know that they are not the only ones," the rat said as it stopped on Nick's right side. "No Zephyx Manufacturer will hire you like this. You know as well as I that all the companies have specific Specters for their Extractors. Without the abilities from these Specters, you will either die very quickly or will cost the company more money than you bring in."
"So, what now?" the rat asked, looking at Nick with a sympathetic expression. "What's the plan now?"
"You don't have an education."
"You don't have contacts."
"You don't have a place to live."
"You don't even remember anything from before you were ten."
"You can't even join the gangs or any of their businesses since you vehemently refused to pay them their fees."
"There's no way out."
"Are you willing to continue living like this?" the rat asked with a sad and pained voice.
"I don't want to see you go through so much pain every day."
"Just stop."
The rat was carefully and slowly moving toward Nick.
As the rat moved closer to Nick, several pairs of eyes appeared behind the dark sewer grates in the alley.
They were watching everything with excitement.
Nick just continued looking at the ground.
"Don't you just want to rest?" the rat asked as it very carefully moved forward. "Every day, you sleep with one eye open, fearing that something or someone will attack you."
"You don't even have a single friend or family member."
"What's the point of fighting?"
"What's the point of living like this?"
"And now, even your last hope is gone."
The rat looked with a sympathetic gaze at Nick.
"Trust me. I've talked to millions of people, and I know a hopeless situation when I see one."
"I can make it quick and painless. If you want, I can even pay special attention to some people you dislike."
"At least, like this, you can go out on your own terms instead of just starving to death."
"Your death would actually have a purpose."
The rat managed to get so close to Nick that it could even touch his leg.
The rats behind the sewer grates slowly and carefully stepped out, but they still remained at a great distance.
It was important not to induce a fight or flight response in their target. Adrenaline can bring momentary life to the black hole inside the chest of a suffering person.
This had to be done methodically, slowly, and carefully.
"Just lay down, okay?" the rat said slowly. "I am going to lightly touch your leg now. Don't be afraid. I won't do anything."
The rat slowly extended its claw to touch Nick's leg.
BANG!
A powerful fist hit the rat, turning it into a bloody paste.
An instant later, all the other rats fled back into the sewer.
Silence.
The fist unclenched and took hold of the smashed rat.
Then, he took out a filthy, old, and disgusting brown sack and put the rat into it.
A moment later, Nick straightened his back and took a deep breath.
"This sucks," he said, his voice a bit deeper than the average man's.
But then, a small smile formed on his lips as he lifted the dirty brown sack.
"But at least dinner is secured."
Suddenly, Nick's eyes narrowed as he shot up to his feet.
He glared down one of the alleyway's exits.
Just now, a muscular man wearing a black coat and black hat had appeared near that exit.
At this moment, Nick could see a mysterious smirk adorning the man's lips as he looked at Nick with amusement.
"What do you want?" Nick asked with a harsh and threatening voice.
Nick had seen many people, and he knew that someone that was acting like this wasn't up to anything good.
"I don't buy drugs, miracle cures, Specters, Zephyx, or whatever you have to sell," Nick said.
A moment later, Nick's eyes widened a bit, and he put the brown sack behind him. "I'm also not selling you the rat!"
The man looked slightly taken aback, but he started chuckling in amusement.
"Your rat? You think I'm after your rat?" he asked with a smirk.
Nick eyed the man suspiciously. "I'm not buying anything! Also, it's rude to enter someone's home unannounced."
"Home?" the man repeated in confusion as he looked around the alleyway.
After looking for a bit, the man saw a small shack made of bits and pieces of discarded and rusty metal.
The man took a deep breath and sighed before his black hat vanished, revealing his handsome face.
There were a couple of covert wrinkles on the man's forehead, and Nick could also see a couple of individual grey hairs among his usual black hair.
The man just chuckled a bit. "You asked me what I wanted," he repeated.
"Well, you could call me a scholar," the man said with a smile as he looked at Nick. "I study Specters. More specifically, the powers Specters can bestow to humans."
"I said I'm not buying anything!" Nick shouted.
The man took another deep breath and released a sigh.
"I am a consultant to many Zephyx Manufacturers, and Ghosty's Lab is one of them," the man said as he slowly lifted his right index finger.
The next moment, a ball of bloody tools made of metal materialized above his finger. The tools were rapidly circling above the man's finger.
When Nick saw that, his jaw nearly hit the floor, and his eyes shone.
"You're a Zephyx Extractor?!" he asked in shock.
The man chuckled. "In the past," he said as the tools vanished again. "Nowadays, I am just a researcher."
Nick still looked with wonder at the man.
A Zephyx Extractor!
Nick gulped.
"Okay," he slowly said. "So, what do you have to sell?"
The man snorted in amusement. "I'm not here to sell anything."
"I'm here because my friend at Ghosty's Lab contacted me. They don't know what kind of power you've attained or from which Specter it comes. My friend knows that I am interested in these things, which was why he told me about you."
Nick became nervous when he heard that.
That sounded like some evil experimentation stuff!
When the man saw Nick's apprehensive expression, he nearly groaned.
"I'm not here to hurt you!" the man half-shouted with annoyance. "I'm just here to look at how your powers work. I will even refer you to some Zephyx Manufacturers if your power proves to be useful!"
"This is a good thing for you!"
Nick was taken aback, but his expression quickly morphed into one of skepticism.
Help?
A good thing?
In the Dregs?
Not even children would believe that!
"And what do you want in exchange?" Nick asked.
"In exchange?" the man repeated. "Do you even have anything that can interest me?"
Nick struggled to think of something.
"Nothing in this world is free," Nick said with suspicion. "Something advertised as free will very quickly turn into something that's not free after some time."
The man's expression turned deadpan. "Oh my fucking god," he said in exasperation.
Suddenly, the man appeared in front of Nick.
BANG!
The man hit Nick's head, and Nick fell to the side, unconscious.
"Is it so hard to accept that someone just wants to help you?!"
Silence.
The man took another deep breath and sighed.
SHING!
The bloody tools from earlier appeared in front of him.
"Now, let's see what kind of power you have."



Chapter 2 The Sign
A young man walked through the streets of a lively but dirty city.
At this moment, it was 2:00 am, but the sun was still shining.
It was always shining.
There was not a single moment where it wasn't shining.
This was how it had been for thousands of years and how it would continue to be for thousands more years.
The sun was directly in the middle of the sky, seemingly perfectly above the walking young man.
Surprisingly, even though the sun was in the middle of the sky, its light wasn't very bright and overwhelming but subdued and more orange-yellowish in color.
For the citizens of Crimson Fungus City, it was currently nighttime. Although, when one talked about night, they were referring to the time between 10 pm and 6 am. This had nothing to do with the state or location of the sun since that was always static.
Most people slept during the night time. No one really knew why, but most people followed that social norm since their parents, grandparents, and everyone else had done the same.
Some crazy people said that people slept during the night because, somehow, the sun used to do something called setting in the past.
Naturally, that was idiotic.
How fast would the sun need to move to go around the Earth?
How would it even move?
It made no sense.
As the young man continued walking, he saw several dirty, grimy, and rusty pipes coming out of the ground, which then slithered up the damaged and dirty walls of buildings.
The floor of the city was uneven, with half of it made of craggy rock and the other half made of rusty grates that led deep underground.
The smell of gas and oil blanketed the "streets", but the people living here had already gotten used to it.
CRACK!
Suddenly, one of the grates below the young man's legs broke, and the young man began to fall.
However, the young man just reflexively spread his arms and grabbed the grates to his side, stopping his fall.
The young man took a deep breath and released it before he pulled himself up.
After pulling himself up, he looked around the street for something.
He saw a couple of thin people that were sitting at the side of the road, talking with each other. Since it was nighttime, not many people were here.
"Hey, do you know where I can get a big sheet of metal?" the young man, Nick, asked the group.
It had been two years since Nick had met the "scholar," and Nick was now 16 years old.
The scholar had told Nick about his power, and he even taught him a couple of things over the next couple of days.
Right now, Nick was about 180cm tall, which was enormous for someone living in the Dregs. The available food was horrible, which made it difficult for people to grow tall.
Nick's body was also still quite muscular, giving him quite an intimidating appearance.
The group collectively furrowed their brows as they looked at him. Nick's bulky figure intimidated them a bit. "What do you want?" an older lady among them said with a tone of threat in her voice.
"I just told you what I want," Nick said as he scratched the side of his head. "I just want a sheet of metal."
"Why?" the older lady asked with annoyance.
Nick just pointed at the hole in the grates with his thumb.
The group just threw a couple of glances at each other.
"You want to repair the hole?" the older lady asked with skepticism.
Nick nodded. "I'm strong enough to stop my fall and pull myself out. Others aren't," he answered.
The lady's expression became even more skeptical. "And you care about that?"
Nick just scratched the back of his head. "I mean, I broke it. I should also fix it," he said with a shrug.
The group looked at each other again.
Then, the older lady pointed at one of the houses at the edge of the street.
The house was basically a ruin. A third of it was already missing, and all the metal of the house had already rusted.
The city had an overabundance of metal, and all the metal that the wealthy parts of the city didn't need anymore ended up in the Dregs.
This was also why nearly all houses here were made of rusty metal.
"The occupant of it said it two days ago," the older lady said, her voice neutral.
Nick nodded. He knew what it meant to "say it".
It basically meant that the person had committed suicide via a specific method.
"Thanks," Nick said as he walked over to the derelict house.
After a bit of searching, Nick saw a two-meter wide and long plate of metal and began to pull.
Sadly, the builder of the house seemed to have had a phobia of his house collapsing, which was why he welded everything together.
Nick tried for a while, but the metal plate only shuddered and made creaking noises.
Nick just sighed and looked around.
Then, he walked into the house, away from all prying eyes.
BANG!
A dent appeared in the metal plate.
BANG! BANG! BANG!
After four hits, the metal plate broke away from the house and fell to the ground outside as Nick exited through the new hole.
The eyes of the earlier group widened in shock.
They knew that this young man was strong based on his stature, but wasn't this a bit too much?!
How much power would one need to dent such a big metal plate?!
Sure, it wasn't super thick, but this was still metal!
Nick pulled the metal plate across the street with quite some difficulties, confusing the group even more.
The guy had just dented the plate, but now he had issues carrying it?!
This made no sense!
A couple of seconds later, Nick put the plate over the hole in the grate that he had created earlier and rubbed the sweat off his forehead.
He walked on top of the plate and jumped a bit. The metal was creaking, but it didn't move.
If the metal could withstand Nick jumping on it, no one would have issues walking over it.
Nick nodded with satisfaction and continued walking through the streets.
He waved a bit at the group as he left.
"Oh! Now, I know who that is!" one of the younger people in the group shouted a couple of seconds later.
The others looked at him. "You know him?"
The younger guy nodded. "He's that weird guy at the marketplace."
"The weird guy?" another person from the group repeated with uncertainty. "Oh, you mean the one that just sits there with a sign all day?"
"Yes, that guy," the other guy said with a nod. "I didn't recognize him since he looks much smaller when he's sitting."
The other people raised their eyebrows in understanding.
Some of them looked at the derelict house again with newfound realization.
That explained how he was strong enough to break the metal.
"This means he has an attuned Zephyx Synchronizer, right?"
The others just nodded. "According to his sign, yes."
The older lady in the group looked at the sheet of metal in the middle of the street.
"You know, if others actually followed his example and fixed what they broke, the Dregs wouldn't be nearly as bad," she commented.
Nick continued walking down the street, and a couple of minutes later, he arrived at a big plaza.
In comparison to the streets, the plaza was mostly made of stone, and the walls weren't too dirty.
Nick could see a couple of merchants stationed around their wagons filled with wares.
Since it was night, only the poorest and the richest merchants sold their wares.
The poorest sold their wares at night since there was far less competition, and the richest did the same since they could just hire someone to keep their shop open all the time.
The other 80% of shops were only open between 6 am and 10 pm.
Nick walked across the plaza until he arrived at the widest road in the Dregs.
The road led to one of the exits of Crimson Fungus City.
At the spot where the road and the plaza met, Nick stopped and walked to the side.
After sitting down, Nick pulled out a roll of cardboard and unrolled it before putting it on a metal rod he had brought with him.
Lastly, Nick just lifted his new sign and waited.
"Zephyx Extractor looking for work!"
And then, he waited.



Chapter 3 Protecting Oneself
People slowly woke up and exited from their derelict houses.
It was early in the morning, but just like always, the sun was high up in the sky, illuminating the streets.
Nick was still holding his sign as he watched the people with boredom.
Over 50% of the people were malnourished, and the remainder could still be called skinny. Only the richest merchants had some visible fat on their bellies.
Even though the sun was shining all day, nearly everyone had pale skin, and a couple of them even had black rings around their eyes as they slowly walked through the streets.
As Nick saw the people, he could tell that most of them were very fidgety and anxious.
Nick knew that this day would be the most dangerous day of the month since people became desperate.
Today was the worst day of the month.
The day everyone dreaded.
Nevertheless, Nick continued holding up his sign as he waited.
Albert, Nick's mentor, told him he would soon find work as a Zephyx Extractor in the Dregs. He only needed to be visible.
Albert was the powerful Zephyx Extractor that Nick had met two years ago. After Nick had woken up from Albert's slap, the two of them had gotten to know each other.
Due to the circumstances of how Nick had gained his mysterious power, Albert decided to mentor Nick for a couple of months since he saw a lot of potential in him.
Albert had left around a year ago, and he told Nick that he just needed to remain visible to find work. Apparently, someone would soon appear that would be interested in finding Zephyx Extractors.
This was why Nick was sitting in the marketplace with his sign.
Even though everyone dreaded today, to Nick, this was just like any other day.
Many people passed by Nick, and he also noticed that nearly everyone was throwing evaluating glances at him.
However, no one actually did anything to him.
Many people were scared and looked around nervously, but others seemed calm and relaxed.
All of the calm ones had small pins on their chest in the image of two crossed spears.
These pins represented the Insurance Gang, one of the most powerful gangs that were running the Dregs from the underground.
The people wearing these pins were not gang members but normal citizens that had paid the Insurance Gang to deal with all the matters today.
BANG!
Suddenly, a man with blonde hair got punched, and a group of three men jumped the guy that got punched.
The man curled into a shrimp and held tightly onto something.
The three attackers continued wailing at the helpless man, but they were careful not to break any bones.
"Hand over your credits!" one of them shouted.
The blonde man on the ground didn't answer and kept holding onto his credits.
The three gritted their teeth.
Killing someone was forbidden, and they were also not allowed to shed any blood.
However, the city wouldn't bat an eye if they broke some bones.
But despite how things looked, the three men were not psychopaths that wanted the guy to die.
If they stole his credits and broke the blonde man's bones, they would essentially kill him in the long run.
One of the men grabbed the blonde guy's hair and pulled back with all his power, but the man on the ground didn't let go of his wealth.
Even when his blonde hair was torn out, he didn't let go.
Two of the attackers looked at their last friend with frustrated and angry expressions.
The last one took a deep breath and took hold of his victim's head.
BANG!
He shoved the man's head into the pavement, and he lost consciousness.
Surprisingly, there was no blood, and the blonde man was still alive.
This had been insanely risky.
If anything went wrong, the attacking man would be killed by the city for killing another person or wasting valuable blood.
A different guy bent down and wrestled a small stack of paper notes out of the blonde man's hands.
After counting the paper notes, he looked at his two friends and nodded.
Then, he handed all the notes to one of his friends, who broke into tears.
The crying man hugged his two friends and bowed several times in gratitude in front of them.
His two friends only assured him that it was fine.
The crying man quickly ran away from the middle of the marketplace and into the arms of a woman by the side.
The woman was also crying a lot.
A moment later, the man let go and kneeled down as he beckoned forward.
Two young girls, not older than eight, came out from behind the woman and hugged the man.
"I have enough for you," the man said with a quivering voice.
Only a couple of people were watching the event. Most people were used to seeing something like this and didn't care.
All the people in the marketplace just walked around the unconscious man lying in the middle of the street, treating him like just another piece of rubble.
Nick had watched what had happened, but he didn't get involved.
What was the point?
There wasn't enough money to go around, and it was the duty of everyone to protect themselves.
As more time passed, more assaults happened, but Nick just waited.
And then, it was time.
Everything calmed down at about 2:00 pm, and the people became very quiet.
By now, the entire marketplace was filled to the brim with people.
No one was buying or selling anything at this moment.
They all were waiting for the same thing.
Two minutes later, the sound of a gigantic swarm of insects came from one of the streets leading to the marketplace, and the sound became louder with time.
Eventually, five people appeared in one of the streets, and they were accompanied by swarms of huge mosquitos.
The five people wore red uniforms with the symbol of Crimson Fungus City on them, showing their identities as people working for the city itself. Each of them carried a couple of big sacks with them, and they wore black gasmasks, keeping their identities anonymous.
As the five city agents walked down the streets, several mosquitos split off and entered the houses they passed.
They were searching for people that were trying to hide.
After a while, the mosquitos came out of the house again and returned to the five people as other mosquitos entered other houses.
Suddenly, an entire swarm of mosquitos charged into one of the houses.
"AAAAAHHHH!"
A terrifying scream came out of the house, but it rapidly became quieter until it vanished.
The swarm of mosquitos came out of the house a couple of seconds later, and some of them flew into the sky and retreated.
But just a couple of seconds later, new mosquitos replaced the ones that had just left.
After around five minutes, the five people arrived at the entrance of the marketplace.
The five people didn't say anything for a while.



Chapter 4 Zephyx
A bit later, three people walked out of the crowd.
All three of them were tall men with muscular bodies, and they were all wearing the same uniform.
It looked like a military uniform painted in black with grey sleeves.
This was the uniform of the Insurance Gang.
"Welcome," the leader of the Insurance Gang said with a polite smile.
One of the five city agents just extended a hand like they were asking for something.
"Of course," the leader said.
A moment later, he took out a suitcase, opened it, and handed it to the man.
Inside the suitcase were stacks upon stacks of credits in paper form.
The city agent counted the money, which took several minutes.
"474," he spoke with a distorted voice.
When the leader of the Insurance Gang heard that, he became nervous, and his smile seemed more strained.
"Excuse me, but it should be 482," he said. "Could you recount, please?"
"474," the city agent repeated.
Silence.
The leader of the Insurance Gang looked at the person to the right of him and gestured with his head.
The guy quickly took out a couple more bills and handed them over.
The city agent counted them and nodded.
"482."
The leader of the Insurance Gang also nodded.
A moment later, the three people walked to the side.
"One by one, come forward. You better not try to cheat us," the leader of the Insurance Gang shouted.
A moment later, all the people with the black pins walked forward and passed by the three men from the Insurance Gang.
The Insurance Gang inspected all of them and collected the black pins from everyone that passed by.
By the end, 479 people had walked past them.
Then, the three people from the Insurance Gang followed them, making the total 482.
After that, four of the five city agents walked towards the less-crowded marketplace and commanded everyone to come forward one by one. The last of them waited in the back, making sure that no one was trying to sneak by them.
Next, all the people in the marketplace walked forward, handing over a stack of credits each.
Nick stood up and passed through the crowd.
A moment later, he stood in front of one of the people with the gasmasks.
Nick handed over a stack of bills and walked past them just like any other person in the marketplace.
After several minutes, only around 800 people were left in the marketplace.
When no one else stepped forward for several seconds, the fifth city agent stepped forward.
"Last call," they shouted with a distorted voice. "Anyone not coming forward now will be considered as not able to pay."
No one moved.
"Alright," the man shouted. "As always, do not make any sudden movements, and don't show any aggression. The mosquitos are all minions of the Blood Mosquito Specter, and they will not drink more than what you owe."
The crowd of people became scared and nervous.
A moment later, the buzzing of the mosquitos intensified, and they flew forward.
The mosquitos scattered across the crowd and started to suck the blood of the people.
As time passed, mosquitos that had filled up flew away as new ones joined.
People were crying, hyperventilating, gritting their teeth, and praying.
Others had already grown used to it.
After around two minutes, all the mosquitos flew back to the five people in gasmasks.
The crowd of people had all become noticeably thinner and whiter.
Lastly, the mosquitos entered all the houses in the marketplace to make sure that no one was trying to hide.
And finally, the five people turned around and left the marketplace behind as they walked down another street.
It was over.
This happened every month on the last day.
Once a month, every citizen of Crimson Fungus City had to pay 100 credits to the city as tax.
One could only pay the tax in full or not at all. Partial payments were not permitted.
If one paid the tax, nothing would happen, but if one failed to pay the tax, they would need to pay with their blood.
A group of people accompanied by large swarms of sizable mosquitos walked through the Dregs once a month, and if a citizen wasn't able to pay the tax, the swarm of mosquitos would fall onto the citizen.
The swarm of mosquitos would gather blood until a collective two liters had been gathered from adults.
Children below the age of 14 only needed to pay 50 credits or one liter of blood.
Children below the age of six didn't need to pay taxes.
Naturally, losing two liters of blood wasn't lethal, and the mosquitos were excellent at not inflicting injuries on the people while gathering blood.
However, recovering from something like that usually took six to eight weeks.
So, if a citizen didn't manage to pay the tax next month as well, things would become dangerous.
Getting 100 credits in one month was nearly impossible for normal people living in the Dregs, but getting 100 credits over two months was manageable.
Because of that, around 50% of people paid blood one month, credits the next, and then blood again.
Of course, countless people had tried to fight their way out of paying taxes, but it always ended the same way.
With the person turning into a bloodless corpse.
In fact, the mosquitos weren't accompanying the tax collectors, but the tax collectors were accompanying the mosquitos.
The tax collectors only came for two reasons.
They dealt with the money.
And they stopped people from panicking in front of the mosquitos.
If the mosquitos wanted, they could kill every living person in the Dregs in less than 10 minutes.
One had to know that there were over 2,000 people living in the Dregs.
It wasn't that the mosquitos were very powerful but that there were literally millions of them, and every mosquito was bigger than a giant hornet.
Naturally, not all of the mosquitos accompanied the tax collectors. There were only around 100 following each tax collector, but if things became serious, millions of them would appear.
Even more, the mosquitos were the minions of a very powerful Specter, the Blood Mosquito.
The rat Nick had talked to two years ago was also a minion of a very powerful Specter called the Parasite.
Some Specters could control animals or create their own animals and control them. Their minions would share the perception of the Specter, and the Specter could also talk and act through the minions.
While nearly all Specters were the enemies of humanity, there were some Specters that cooperated and helped humanity.
The Blood Mosquito was one of them.
The Parasite was not.
The Blood Mosquito gained power by consuming human blood. Naturally, it could send some isolated mosquitos to gather blood from sleeping people, but if it overdid things, the truly powerful Zephyx Manufacturers would notice it and kill it.
So, the Blood Mosquito had decided to help humanity instead, and Crimson Fungus City was the perfect place.
Crimson Fungus City was named after the strongest Specter that was being confined inside the most prestigious Zephyx Manufacturer, the Crimson Fungus.
In contrast to nearly all powerful Specters, the Crimson Fungus was not intelligent.
As the name implied, the Crimson Fungus was just a huge fungus living inside a containment unit.
Just like the Blood Mosquito, the Crimson Fungus gained power by absorbing human blood.
But in return, the Crimson Fungus was creating electricity and, most importantly, Zephyx.
Zephyx could be used for basically everything.
It could be transformed into electricity, heat, movement, and so on, and it was extremely efficient at it.
Even more, Zephyx could also be used to increase the powers of Zephyx Extractors, and it could also be used to create powerful weapons that could deal with Specters.
The Crimson Fungus was the reason why the Blood Mosquito had chosen this city.
The Blood Mosquito would help the Zephyx Manufacturer in collecting the blood, and it would get to keep some of the blood in exchange.
The remaining blood would be sprinkled onto the Crimson Fungus, which would then produce Zephyx.
The Zephyx Extractors would collect the Zephyx, and they would be allowed to keep a bit of it as payment.
The Zephyx Manufacturer would then use the harvested Zephyx to increase the power of their company or sell it to other cities.
But if the Zephyx Manufacturer wanted to get bigger and earn even more money, they needed even stronger Specters.
And to get these even stronger Specters, they needed stronger Zephyx Extractors.
This was what Nick wanted to become.
Being a Zephyx Extractor meant being able to become powerful and having a better life.
Nick wanted to get out of the Dregs and finally live a better life.



Chapter 5 Young Man
After the tax collectors left, things returned to normal in the marketplace.
The anxiety of most people had been replaced with either relief or acceptance.
Sadly, even though many people lost two liters of blood today, they couldn't go home and rest.
They needed to work and earn money. Otherwise, they would need to pay with their blood again in a month.
Nick returned to his usual place and continued holding up his sign.
Nick trusted Albert, and he was sure that Albert wouldn't have told him to make himself noticeable if there were no point to it.
Sadly, no one of note talked to Nick, and he had to go home after a while since he was getting hungry.
By now, Nick was no longer living in a small cube made of metal but in an actual house… which was also made of rusty metal.
One of the richer people died recently, and his house had become available.
Well, available might not be the correct word.
The man died, and his son was actually now the owner of the house.
The problem was that the son was only eleven years old.
Naturally, the gangs wanted to take the house from the kid, but Nick went between the two sides and protected the kid.
Nick would protect the kid and his inheritance, but in exchange, Nick was allowed to use their money to eat and pay his tax.
Of course, the kid didn't have any other choice and accepted.
After a couple of fights, the gangs decided that it wasn't worth the trouble.
If Nick were just a normal guy, they would just send in like ten guys to beat him up, but Nick actually had an active Zephyx Synchronizer.
No one was heavily injured or dead yet, but if they escalated things, things might change quickly.
They were certain they could take Nick down, but they were not willing to pay the price. The house wasn't worth enough since it was just a bit above average. Also, the kid had a claim on it, and the gangs couldn't get too overbearing.
Smart, organized criminals knew that leading a flock of willing and happy sheep was easier than leading a flock of terrified sheep.
That was also why the leader of the Insurance Gang had been willing to pay the difference in the taxes out of pocket.
Some of his people had obviously siphoned some funds out of the collected taxes, and they would hold an internal investigation.
If the leader had decided to simply hand over the eight people with the missing cash, his Insurance Gang wouldn't be as trustworthy anymore, and next month, they might only get like 70% of their previous customers.
The Insurance Gang asked for 10% of the taxes as a protection and processing fee, which meant that adults would pay them ten credits to protect their 100 credits.
With about 480 customers, that came to 4,800 credits. Even when the leader paid 800 credits out of pocket, they still made a profit of 4,000 credits.
If he had refused to hand over the 800 credits, they would have saved 800 credits today, but they might pay 1,500 credits in lost profits for every following month for a long time.
Even though they were criminals and this was the Dregs, it was still important that people were satisfied with the services provided.
And waging war against someone that was protecting a vulnerable child was bad.
It wasn't worth it.
Of course, everything had its advantages and disadvantages.
While Nick got a nice home and had no money problems anymore, he had permanently destroyed any opportunity to work for any of the gangs.
For two weeks, Nick kept going to the marketplace to wait with his sign raised.
One particular day that didn't seem different from any other, someone approached Nick in the marketplace.
It was a young but tall man with light-brown hair. His hair was chaotic, but it was clean. His brown shirt and trousers were torn but just as clean.
As someone that had lived in the Dregs for his entire life, Nick could immediately tell that the guy in front of him was trying to act poor when he obviously wasn't.
The guy probably hadn't even seen a poor person up to today. Otherwise, his disguise wouldn't be so superficial.
The man walked up to Nick with a friendly smile, but Nick could see that the guy was very nervous deep inside.
"Hey, you're a Zephyx Extractor?" the man asked as he looked at Nick's sign.
"I got through the entrance exam for Ghosty's Lab, but I never worked as one since my Zephyx Synchronizer is already attuned," Nick answered as he looked with suspicion at the guy.
A small glimmer appeared in the guy's eyes when he heard that. "Your Zephyx Synchronizer is already attuned?"
Nick nodded.
Silence.
The guy seemed uncertain about how to proceed with the conversation, and Nick could practically read his thoughts with how expressive his face was.
Nick was quite certain that the guy was trying to find a way to get Nick to tell him more about himself without seeming like a shady person that wanted to scam him.
"You know Albert?" Nick asked.
The guy's eyes widened for just an instant before he smiled uncomfortably. "There are many people called Albert," he said awkwardly.
'Bullshit,' Nick thought. 'Nobody here is called Albert except for that one guy.'
"Black and grey hair, and he summoned a couple of things that can hover. Maybe you can fill out the last detail to make sure that we are talking about the same person," Nick said with a suspicious expression.
The man blinked a couple of times. "He is fond of tools," the man added after a while.
When Nick heard that, he smiled brightly. "Finally," he said as he stood up, making the man move backward. "Albert told me that someone would come with a job in the near future. I guess you're the guy?"
The man also became excited. Apparently, he had also expected to meet someone.
But then, his expression fell, and he became suspicious.
"I know him, but I don't think I have the capital to hire you. I also live in the Dregs," he said carefully.
At that moment, the surrounding people threw incredulous looks at him as they stopped walking.
The man noticed, and he felt like he had said something wrong.
"Dude," Nick said, making the man turn to him, "you just said capital. Also, your disguise is horrible. Nobody will believe you. If they did, they would have already shaken you down for everything you have, based on how uncertain and fearful you look."
The man's smile turned more uncomfortable. "I'm not sure-"
"Come with me," Nick said as he grabbed the guy's arm to pull him away.
The guy looked with shock at the place where Nick was grabbing him, and for just an instant, his eyes turned pure white.
But he quickly calmed down again, and his eyes turned back to normal instantaneously.
He had never seen anyone that just grabbed a stranger and pulled them away.
"Hey, I can walk on my own," the guy said as he pulled his arm out of Nick's grip.
"Then, come," Nick said, gesturing with his head to the distance.
The man took out a handkerchief and cleaned the spot where Nick had touched him, and followed after him.
After a couple of minutes, they arrived in front of Nick's temporary home.
The man became a bit uncertain again, but he just took a deep breath and entered.



Chapter 6 Wyntor Melfion
When the man entered the house, he became more uncomfortable.
There was dirt everywhere, and there were even several holes in the walls. If he became careless, he might even cut himself on the sharp edges of the walls.
"Hey, come over!" Nick shouted from one of the rooms.
The man walked over and saw Nick sitting on the ground in the middle of a bigger room.
There were no tables or chairs.
Then, he just looked at the place in front of Nick with a questioning gaze. "Should I sit down?"
"Well, duh," Nick answered with a roll of his eyes.
The man took a deep breath and sat down.
"Do you have anything to drink?" he asked.
"The water barrel is in the back." Nick gestured to his back.
"Oh, okay," the man said. "Do you have a glass or a mug?"
Nick blinked slowly.
"A what?" he asked.
"You know, a mug," he repeated, gesturing with his hands. "A small container for liquids."
Nick blinked slowly again.
"Why? Just drink," he said with a deadpan expression and voice.
The man looked with an uncomfortable expression at Nick.
"Never mind. I'm not thirsty," he said.
Silence.
"I'm Wyntor," the man said, stretching his hand forward for a handshake.
Nick looked at the hand.
"What do you want?" he asked, looking at it.
"A handshake and an introduction?" Wyntor asked awkwardly, keeping his arm outstretched.
Nick furrowed his brows and moved his own hand forward.
Then, Nick grabbed Wyntor's fingers and looked him in the eyes. "I'm Nick."
Wynter smiled uncomfortably and moved his hand up and down for a handshake while Nick looked back at the shaking hands.
"Could you please let go?" Wyntor asked.
Nick frowned, confused why Wyntor wanted them to hold hands and then suddenly not, but he still let go of Wyntor's fingers.
"Sorry, Nick, I still need to get used to how people down here act," Wyntor said with an apologetic expression.
'Sure enough, he isn't from here,' Nick thought.
The fact that Wyntor had said "down here" meant that he came from the inner city.
Crimson Fungus City was comprised of two parts, the inner city, and the outer city.
If one were to look at Crimson Fungus City from a plane, one would see a huge city, which surrounded an absolutely enormous structure in the middle of it.
The structure was a humongous curvy pyramid in the shape of a hyperbola. It was made of reflective metal and was nearly two kilometers high and five kilometers wide.
Around this huge structure were many tall and expensive buildings, but the further one got away from the center, the smaller and uglier the buildings got.
About three kilometers away from the edge of the structure was the Dregs, the outermost part of the city.
In the Dregs were the poorest people who could barely survive. Between the Dregs and the inner city was the actual outer city.
Ghosty's Lab was in the inner city, but the location for the exam had been in the outer city.
Nick had heard legends about the inner city, but he had never been there, and he had only met two people that had been there.
Albert and Wyntor.
"You're from the inner city, right?" Nick asked.
"Yes, but from the lower levels," Wyntor answered. "It's my first time in the Dregs."
"I can tell," Nick said as Wyntor only smiled uncomfortably.
"So, why are you here?" Nick asked.
"Before I tell you, I need you to sign something," Wyntor said as he took some sheets of paper from a small sack hanging from his belt.
Nick looked at the first sheet of paper and furrowed his brows.
"No… Noon… disc-low-sure agree… ment? Noon disclowsure agreement? What's that?" Nick asked.
Wyntor looked with shock at Nick. "You can't read?"
Nick furrowed his brows. "I can read! I learned it from Albert! I'm just out of practice!"
"Okay, okay!" Wyntor answered quickly. "That's a non-disclosure agreement. It means that you are not allowed to talk about any of the things I'm about to tell you to anyone else, or the city will come for you. Essentially, if you talk about my secrets, you will be a criminal."
"Okay," Nick said absentmindedly as he tried to read the first sentence of the NDA, but it was far beyond difficult.
Reading and understanding a legal document was already difficult for adults with a lot of money, and Nick's reading comprehension was on the level of an elementary school student.
After a couple of minutes, Wyntor offered to just read out everything for Nick, but Nick said he didn't trust him and that he would read it himself.
Two hours and many questions about what words meant later, Nick had finally finished reading everything.
After some more instructions from Wyntor, Nick awkwardly signed the bottom of the page.
Nick was so confused about all of this. He knew what he had signed, but it was still so alien and strange.
"Okay," Wyntor said with a relieved sigh. "Everything we talk about from now on is subject to the NDA, which means you are not allowed to tell the contents to a third person without my consent. Do you understand?"
Nick nodded.
"My full name is Wyntor Melfion, and I am the third heir to the Melfion family," Wyntor said.
Nick blinked a couple of times.
Silence.
"Okay," Nick commented.
Wyntor took a deep breath. He had never gotten such a dismissive reaction to the revelation of his family name.
"My father is on the board of directors of Kugelblitz," Wyntor added.
Nick blinked once slowly.
"Okay?" he said.
Wyntor ruffled his hair in frustration.
"He partially runs the city!" Wyntor shouted. "Kugelblitz is the Zephyx Manufacturer that has the Crimson Fungus, and my father owns 20% of Kugelblitz!"
"Oh," Nick said in surprise. "That's cool, I guess?"
Wyntor massaged the bridge of his nose in annoyance and sighed.
"It's not important anyway," he said. "What's important is that my father doesn't want his heirs to grow up to be useless good-for-nothings. He worked hard to get where he is now, and he wants us to do the same thing."
"Because of that, he instructed all of his children to build a Zephyx Manufacturer Company and earn enough to buy 0.05% of Kugelblitz. Otherwise, we don't get to use our family's resources," Wyntor explained.
"0.05%?" Nick asked. "How much is that? Like a thousand credits?"
Wyntor snorted. "More like 50 million."
Nick's eyes shot open in shock.
50 million credits?!
Wait, and Wyntor's father owned 20% of that company?!
How much money was that?!
Wyntor smirked when he saw that Nick was finally surprised by his background.
"Anyway," he said, "In comparison to my siblings, I refuse to get taken advantage of by the Zephyx Manufacturers in the inner city and came out here where there is basically zero competition."
"I need a Zephyx Extractor to get my business off the ground, and since I don't have a Specter, I can't just recruit normal people. I need someone that already has an attuned Zephyx Synchronizer."
"Albert told me that I would find someone meeting my criteria in the central marketplace of the Dregs, and that's why we are here now."
By now, Wyntor's anxiety and uncertainty in his demeanor had completely vanished, replaced by a competent, direct, and charismatic businessman.
"I want to employ you as my Chief Zephyx Extractor."
"And the first thing we need is to capture a Specter!"



Chapter 7 Specters
"I'm in!" Nick immediately answered.
Wyntor was a bit taken aback.
"That was quick," he said with a couple of blinks. "Don't you want to know anything about your job? Salary? Duties?"
"Is it worse than my current situation?" Nick asked.
Wyntor glanced around the broken and dirty home. Even though this was one of the bigger houses in the Dregs, it was still in horrendous condition.
"The chances of death are rather high," Wyntor commented. "After all, you have to interact with Specters."
Nick nodded. "So, I gotta beat some Specters up. No big deal."
Wyntor furrowed his brows in skepticism. "Do you even know what a Specter is?"
"Powerful animals or humans with some abilities, right?" Nick asked casually. "As long as I can punch them, they can die, right?"
Wyntor took a deep breath and sighed.
"That's true for some of them, but that is not the majority," he answered. "Do you know what Zephyx is?"
"Stuff we get from Specters," Nick answered with a confident nod.
"Yes, but what is it?" Wyntor asked with another sigh.
Silence.
"Energy?" Nick asked with uncertainty.
Wyntor just snorted. "That's a copout answer. You can say everything is energy, and you wouldn't be wrong."
"Have you ever heard of Prephyx?"
"Prefix? The stuff you put before words?" Nick asked.
"No, Prephyx, spelled P-R-E-P-H-Y-X, not P-R-E-F-I-X. It's like Zephyx but with pre- instead of ze-."
Nick shook his head.
"Alright," Wyntor said with a bit of annoyance. "Lemme just give you a quick rundown of how the world actually works."
Nick nodded and listened to Wyntor.
"Prephyx is an invisible force of energy that exists all over the world. It can only be detected by very advanced equipment and by very powerful Extractors. Prephyx has an incredible amount of energy stored inside of it."
"Sadly, we can't access the Prephyx in the atmosphere. We simply don't have any means to actually make use of the energy stored inside the Prephyx."
"When the Prephyx in the atmosphere gains a certain level of density, it can create a Specter. A Specter is something that can transform Prephyx into Zephyx, which is a usable form of Prephyx."
"A Specter is not necessarily alive, and it is not necessarily intelligent. Additionally, Specters are unique, which means that there is only one Specter of any kind in the world. There are never two or more Specters that are identical. In general, Specters appear in one of three different forms, but there can be exceptions.
"One, a Force Specter. A Force Specter can be an intelligent or non-intelligent being that consists of forms of energy. For example, the Specter we call The Fog is a formless cloud of something that mimics fog."
"It is unintelligent and only follows its basic instinct. From time to time, it wanders through some parts of the city and engulfs someone. That person will then wander aimlessly in the fog until they die of starvation."
"You can't feel The Fog. You can't punch The Fog. You can't run out of The Fog. If it catches you, you will die unless you are a strong Zephyx Extractor that has equipment and abilities based on Zephyx."
"Is The Fog still around?" Nick asked.
Wyntor laughed bitterly. "Have you forgotten what I said earlier? When Prephyx reaches a certain density, a Specter can appear."
"Something like The Fog is extremely difficult to contain. Additionally, it only consumes about one human every month. The Fog is a level two Specter, which makes it stronger than the most common Specters, but it only consumes one human every month."
"Now, if we were to kill it, its energy would disperse into the atmosphere again, and we would quickly find a couple more level one Specters in the world, and chances are that they will cost more human lives than The Fog."
"Wait!" Nick shouted. "But can't we just store all the Zephyx of The Fog after killing it?"
Surprisingly, Wyntor nodded. "We can."
"But it doesn't change anything."
"What?" Nick asked in surprise.
Wyntor nodded again. "Naturally, when we kill a Specter, we store all their energy, but it doesn't change anything. If we ignore all the energy and let it disperse, a couple of level one Specters will appear. If we store all the energy and don't let it disperse, a couple of level one Specters will still appear."
"No matter what we do, killing a Specter will always result in the creation of more, weaker Specters."
Nick looked at the ground with a worried expression.
That was… troublesome.
This meant that they couldn't possibly get rid of the Specters.
Wyntor noticed Nick's crestfallen expression. "It's not as hopeless as you think."
Nick looked at Wyntor.
"Humanity's ultimate plan for survival is to contain every single Specter in the world without killing them. If we can do that, all the Specters would essentially become irrelevant since they wouldn't be a danger anymore," Wyntor explained.
Nick furrowed his brows again. "That sounds difficult. There are probably a lot of Specters."
"Oh, the numbers aren't the problem," Wyntor said casually. "You have no idea how powerful Extractors can become. The issue isn't the number, but the power of the Specters."
"Please remember that everything we are talking about is subject to the NDA. If you tell anyone else about it, your life will essentially be forfeit."
Nick nodded.
Wyntor nodded back. "Specters are categorized into different levels of power. Every new Specter starts at level one. This makes them more powerful than every normal human, but people with an attuned Zephyx Synchronizer can fight them."
"Specters and Extractors can both become more powerful. The strongest Zephyx Extractors that exist are level eight, and we have a single-digit number of them."
"However, there is a two-digit number of level eight Specters in the world."
Nick looked with shock at Wyntor.
And then, Nick remembered something he had witnessed several times by now.
"What about Nurse Alice?" he asked.
Everyone knew about Nurse Alice.
Everyone in the Dregs had seen Nurse Alice.
And everyone knew that Nurse Alice was a Specter.
Wyntor sighed. "Nurse Alice is one of the five level nine Specters."
Nick took a deep breath.
"There are exactly five level nine Specters in the world, and even if all of humanity banded together, we wouldn't be able to stop even a single one of them."
"Nurse Alice is probably the most damaging Specter in the entire world. She kills hundreds and sometimes even thousands of humans every single day."
"But her power is so great that nobody can do anything against her."
"She does whatever she wants, and we can do nothing but watch."
"And there are four more like her."



Chapter 8 Kill The Sun
Nick thought back to the last time he had seen Nurse Alice.
It was a bit more than two months ago.
The people had gathered in the marketplace to pay their Blood Tax, and a man had just stolen all the credits of a frail young woman.
It had been quite obvious that she had already paid with her blood for the last or even the last two times.
After she had lost her credits, she just looked at the ground with a dead expression.
And then, she had uttered The Sentence.
"I wish I were dead."
At that moment, the marketplace fell silent.
Everyone knew what it meant to say The Sentence.
A minute later, a girl with a bright and kind smile walked into the marketplace. She looked like she was in her late teens, and she wore a clean pink nurse's outfit.
No one dared to stand in her way, and even though the marketplace was filled to the brim, the people still managed to make a wide road for the kindly smiling nurse.
The nurse walked over to the woman, who was still kneeling in the middle of the marketplace.
The woman looked up when the nurse stopped in front of her.
The nurse just kindly smiled at her. "I'm Nurse Alice, and I'm here because you called me," she said with a kind and empathetic tone. "Just calm down. It will be over soon, and you won't feel any pain or discomfort."
The woman looked at the ground again.
A moment later, Nurse Alice kneeled down beside her and slowly moved her right palm over the woman's eyes, like someone that was closing the opened eyes of a corpse.
When she had closed her eyes, the woman had already died.
Nurse Alice gently laid the corpse on the ground and stood up with a kind smile.
A moment later, she vanished from the marketplace.
If anyone in the world uttered something akin to "I wish I were dead," "I want to die," "Just kill me," "I don't want to live anymore," or anything similar to that, Nurse Alice would appear and grant that wish.
It didn't matter whether the person wanted it or not. After uttering The Sentence, Nurse Alice would kill them.
Even if The Sentence were said as a joke, it didn't matter.
If anyone, for any reason, uttered something akin to The Sentence, Nurse Alice would arrive and end their life.
Have you ever said anything like that in your life?
Maybe when a loved one died.
Maybe when your head was hanging in the toilet after too much drinking.
Maybe when something really embarrassing happened.
The occasion didn't matter.
As long as anyone said it, Nurse Alice would arrive.
"And she's only one of the five level nine Specters?" Nick asked.
Wyntor nodded. "Three of the level nine Specters are unmissable. I can guarantee you that almost everyone has seen the three of them in their life before. Do you know the other two?"
Nick quickly nodded. "I know one of them. It's the one that resides in the darkness."
"Correct," Wyntor said. "The Nightmare is one of the five level nine Specters, and it is omnipresent in all the dark places in the world. The darker the place, the stronger its influence."
Nick remembered one of the many times he had encountered The Nightmare.
Nick had once been searching for food, which was why he had walked into the sewers. Luckily, the ceiling of the sewers was mostly made of grates, which meant that the omnipresent sun could also illuminate them.
However, there had been some dark corridors in the sewers as well, and whenever Nick walked through them, he heard the whispers.
Human voices appeared in the darkness, telling Nick that everyone was trying to kill him and that nobody cared whether he lived or died.
The whispers were trying to fill Nick's mind with paranoia, depression, self-doubt, hatred, anger, and every other kind of negative emotion.
They wanted to warp Nick into a different person.
Luckily, the dark corridors hadn't been that dark and long, which made it possible for him to quickly get through them and find a rat to eat.
The existence of The Nightmare was also the reason why many newly built "houses" in the Dregs purposefully created several holes in the ceiling and walls.
Being in the darkness was extremely dangerous, which was why everyone avoided being in dark places.
The Nightmare and Nurse Alice were so powerful that it didn't matter where someone was.
Their influence extended across the entire world.
"Do you also know of the third one?" Wyntor asked.
Nick thought about the question for a while, but eventually, he just shook his head.
"Surprisingly," Wyntor said, "the third one is the most conspicuous of all."
Then, Wyntor pointed up.
Nick looked up and saw that Wyntor was pointing at a hole in the ceiling, and Nick could see the Sun through that hole.
"It's The Sun," Wyntor said.
Nick's eyes widened.
The Sun?
Wait, the Sun is a Specter?!
"Surprising, right?" Wyntor commented.
Nick just nodded.
"We have managed to somewhat calculate and understand the powers of the other four level nine Specters, but when it comes to The Sun, we are essentially still blind."
"It is everywhere all the time. Anyone that flies above a certain height immediately ceases to exist. Everyone sees The Sun exactly above them at all times. It doesn't matter on which side of the planet you are. The Sun is always at the same spot for everyone individually."
"And most shocking of all, its light is real. The entire world is illuminated by its light. It has the power to illuminate the entire world at the same time without having to take a break."
"The sheer amount of energy that requires is incomprehensible."
"All of humanity agrees that The Sun is the most powerful Specter that exists in the world, and it is the biggest obstacle standing between humanity and freedom."
"If humanity ever wants to achieve freedom, there's only a single thing we need to do."
"Kill The Sun."



Chapter 9 Null
Nick just looked with shock at Wyntor.
Kill The Sun?
How?!
How could a human destroy something as powerful as the sun?!
What would even happen after it was destroyed?!
"Of course," Wyntor added, "all of that is far in the future, and we might not witness it in our lifetime."
Nick looked at the hole in the ceiling again.
In the last couple of minutes, the world had become much bigger to him.
Until now, Nick had just wanted to get a good job to live a better life, but now he had heard about so many grand things.
Humanity was several times weaker than the collective Specters.
Nick only sighed.
Nick had seen horrible things in the Dregs, and he wanted to change the world.
Surprisingly, Nick's issue wasn't with the gangs or the robbers but with the system.
The people simply did what they could to survive.
If there were enough to go around, people might not kill each other as much.
Sure, greed would always be present, but it wouldn't be so overwhelming.
Sadly, Nick knew that he was just one man.
He couldn't change anything.
So, the next best thing was to live a good life without having to compromise his moral compass.
If he had the power to change things, he would, but he didn't, and he most likely never will.
After a couple of seconds of silence, Nick sighed. "What about the other two?"
"The fourth one is The Maw," Wyntor explained. "The Maw is not something that the majority of people will ever come into contact with since it exclusively interacts with Zephyx Extractors."
"From time to time, it grabs a group of Extractors and forces them to fight each other until only a single one survives, who is then allowed to leave."
Nick sighed. "And there's nothing we can do?"
Wyntor just shook his head.
"What about the last one?" Nick asked.
Wyntor looked a bit troubled and furrowed his brows. "The last one is difficult to talk about since it is rather special."
"No one knows what it looks like, and no one knows where it is, but the effects of its existence are indisputable."
Wyntor looked up at The Sun through the hole. "In a way, it's the opposite of The Sun."
"Everyone's attention is fixed on The Sun, almost like it is afraid of not being seen by everyone in the world. The fifth level nine Specter is the opposite."
"It's like it doesn't dare to show itself."
"No one is allowed to know what it looks, sounds, tastes, smells, or feels like. There have been cases in which some powerful Extractors analyzed all the scattered clues of its existence."
Wyntor looked at the ground with a troubled expression. "One day, that group died, and all their findings were destroyed along with them."
Then, Wyntor looked at Nick. "But interestingly enough, nothing else was damaged. Only the things relevant to it had been destroyed."
"Due to the manner of its existence, we call it Null."
"Null…" Nick repeated with a shocked voice.
Wyntor just raised an eyebrow. "Why are you so surprised? Specters have strange abilities."
Nick looked at the ground.
After a bit, he looked at his hands with an unsure expression.
"I think I understand now," he said. "That's why Albert was so interested in me."
Wyntor looked with quite some interest at Nick. "Do tell."
Nick looked at Wyntor.
"I think I've seen Null before."
For just an instant, Wyntor was taken aback, but he quickly became skeptical. "If you did, you would be dead."
Nick slowly shook his head. "I think I have seen it before, but I do not know what it looks, smells, tastes, sounds, or feels like."
Wyntor blinked several times. "What?" he asked in confusion.
"I have amnesia," Nick said. "I don't remember anything from before I was ten. My earliest memory is waking up in a room in a random house in the Dregs. I lived in the house for a couple of days, but some people came in and threw me onto the streets."
Wyntor looked with intensity at Nick. "And what makes you believe that you have seen Null?"
"My attuned Zephyx Synchronizer," Nick said. "It has been attuned ever since I remember."
"Speaking of," Wyntor said. "I need to know what kind of ability you have. Can you show me?"
Nick laughed helplessly. "That's the thing."
"It's impossible."
"I can't show you my ability."
Wyntor's expression became skeptical. "Then, how am I supposed to believe that you even have one?"
"I have one, but I can't show you," Nick said.
"Explain," Wyntor said.
"I can only use my ability when no one can see me," Nick explained. "When no one can see me, I can move about five times faster, and my body is several times stronger."
Wyntor rubbed his chin in thought. "That is a very substantial increase in power. Can you prove your ability in some way?"
Nick remembered the time he had fixed the hole in the ground by breaking part of a house and nodded.
"Follow me," Nick said as he walked out of the house.
Wyntor followed Nick, and the two of them stopped beside a ruin of a house.
After a bit of testing, Nick found an iron plate that had been bolted onto two stable beams.
No normal human could get the iron plate off the beams without tools.
"Wait on this side," Nick said as he walked to the other side.
Wyntor waited with raised eyebrows.
BOOOM!
Wyntor's eyes shot open in shock as he saw a big dent appear on the iron plate!
BOOOM!
Another huge dent appeared after an explosive sound!
"That enough?" Nick asked as he walked out from behind the plate.
Wyntor still had difficulties believing Nick.
What if Nick had prepared some kind of contraption that he could quickly hide after using it?
Wyntor wanted to test Nick some more, but after several minutes of different kinds of tests, Wyntor could only accept that what Nick was claiming was the truth.
As they returned to the house, Wyntor thought about Nick's ability, and when they sat down again, Wyntor had only one question.
"How can you use that ability against an opponent? As soon as you enter a fight with anyone, you effectively lose all your power."
Nick smiled uncomfortably.
"I have no idea."



Chapter 10 Everything Prepared
Inside the house, the two of them returned to talking.
Wyntor and Nick talked about Nick's duties and the plans of development for their Zephyx Manufacturing Company.
Wyntor also told Nick about the two remaining categories of Specters since they had gotten sidetracked earlier.
The first one was a Force Specter, which represented a Specter in the form of something untouchable. The Fog had been used as an example.
The second kind of Specter was a Physical Specter. As the name suggested, a Physical Specter had a physical body. The body could be an animal, a human, a plant, an item, and so on.
For example, the Crimson Fungus was a Physical Specter. It could be touched, and it could be injured by a strong physical force, while something like The Fog couldn't be injured by a physical force, even though The Fog was vastly inferior to the Crimson Fungus.
Lastly, there were Possession Specters. These were Specters that did not have their own bodies. Instead, they took control over a living or non-living entity.
For example, Ghosty's Lab had once essentially won the lottery by finding The Glasses, which was a Possession Specter.
The Glasses was a level two Specter, and it simply looked like a pair of glasses. If anyone put on the glasses, their reality would slightly warp in very inconspicuous ways. Over a long-enough period of time, the wearer would become insane.
But that was it.
As long as one knew what was going on, it wouldn't be a big issue, and to top it all off, The Glasses produced Zephyx as long as someone wore them.
It didn't endanger anyone.
It didn't attempt to escape.
It was easy to get Zephyx from it.
It was the perfect Specter for Zephyx Manufacturers.
Naturally, Wyntor and Nick wanted to get a Possession Specter for their business, but finding one depended on luck and resources.
The two of them wouldn't even be able to do anything against a Force Specter since they didn't have any Zephyx Equipment yet. Without equipment made of Zephyx, it was impossible to interact with Force Specters.
Even worse, Force Specters were notorious for being hard to contain since most of them could just pass through walls.
Containing a Force Specter needed a highly advanced containment unit made of many different materials made of Zephyx.
In the end, they were left with going after a Physical Specter, but that came with its own challenges.
First, even a level one Specter was something that every Zephyx Manufacturer wanted. Even the really big ones.
Specters were very rare, and all the big Zephyx Manufacturers had people dedicated to finding clues about possible Specters.
Then, Nick also had to contain them, and lastly, he could only attempt to get a level one Specter.
A level two Specter was too powerful for a new Zephyx Extractor like Nick.
The rat that had tried to convince Nick to kill himself had once said that Nick had met two Specters.
Yet, Nick hadn't been able to see the Specters.
To Nick, it had been like he had never seen any Specters, which meant that the Specters had been either invisible or mixed among the crowd of people.
Surprisingly, Nick didn't doubt the rat's words. After all, he knew who the rat was.
In fact, everyone knew about the rats.
The rats were the minions of a very powerful Specter called The Parasite.
The Parasite was located somewhere in the wilderness, and nobody had seen it before.
In order to get human corpses, The Parasite took control of a huge swarm of rats and sent them into the city. Through its minions, it could interact with and sense the entire city.
And when someone was suicidal or depressed, one of the rats would walk out and try to convince that person to kill themselves.
While The Parasite was very powerful, its rats weren't very powerful, and forcefully attacking someone with a swarm of rats had proven to be very inefficient. Because of that, The Parasite tried to convince people to kill themselves without uttering The Sentence.
Despite everything, Nurse Alice wasn't the biggest fan of having the corpses of her clients defiled, which was why The Parasite didn't dare to consume the corpse of someone that had uttered The Sentence.
Nevertheless, The Parasite was very powerful, and it could probably find all kinds of Specters in the city.
Sadly, it was impossible to work with The Parasite. Otherwise, it would already be working with one of the bigger Zephyx Manufacturers.
Eventually, Wyntor and Nick ironed out all the details, and their working relationship was set in stone.
Wyntor was the owner, CEO, clerk, recruiter, and administrator of the company. Essentially, he was dealing with everything that wasn't related to interacting with Specters.
Nick was the Chief Zephyx Extractor, information gatherer, and security officer.
In short, Wyntor was the brains, and Nick was the muscles.
Wyntor also showed Nick the place he had bought for their company.
In the western edge of the Dregs, just a little bit before the actual city, Wyntor had bought a big warehouse.
In comparison to all the buildings in the Dregs, the warehouse actually wasn't made of rusty metal. Instead, it just looked plain.
Inside, the warehouse had been completely emptied except for one thing.
In the center of the warehouse was a steel cuboid, 5x5x3 meters big.
This was one of the cheapest containment units available, but it already cost a ridiculous sum to get one.
According to Wyntor, this Containment Unit had cost him over 200,000 credits.
It was made of extremely hard steel, and the walls were over 30 centimeters thick.
Nick even wanted to try if he could escape from it, but the walls were so hard that even he was helpless.
This kind of cheap Containment Unit could safely contain a level one Physical and Possession Specter, but it wouldn't work against Force Specters.
Even more, level two Physical Specters would have enough power to slowly chip away at the containment unit until it broke.
When Nick heard that, he realized how powerful a level two Specter actually was.
A level two Specter could break through this insanely solid room of metal?!
Eventually, everything had been prepared.
They had a Containment Unit.
They had an administrator.
They had a Zephyx Extractor.
Now, they were only missing the last piece.
A Specter.
As Nick walked back onto the streets, he just awkwardly scratched the back of his head.
"I have no idea where I can find one."



Chapter 11 Where to Start
Nick had no idea where to start.
Everything had been prepared, and now, they only needed a Specter.
But where could they even get a Specter from?
The big Zephyx Manufacturers had several people searching for Specters at any given time while Nick was basically alone.
Sure, there was also Wyntor, but it wasn't his job to find and capture Specters.
'Should I search for a Specter with minions? I mean, I know about the Blood Mosquito and the Parasite, but both of them are too powerful.'
'Wait, do weak Specters even have minions, or does that require a lot more power?'
Nick just scratched the back of his head as he stood in front of the warehouse.
'There are three kinds of Specters, and I can't even attempt to get any Force Specters. That only leaves Possession Specters and Physical Specters.'
'I really doubt that I would easily find a Possession Specter since the Zephyx Manufacturers love those. At least, that was what Wyntor said.'
'That means I have to find a Physical Specter.'
'But where?'
Nick scratched the side of his head.
'I mean, I heard the outside is basically filled with Specters, but everybody knows that the outside is extremely dangerous. Level two Specters are already able to damage the walls of the Containment Unit, while I can't even make a dent in them. Obviously, level three Specters would be even more powerful.'
'I don't think going outside of the city would be a smart idea.'
Nick sighed.
'Guess that means I'm stuck searching for a Physical Specter inside the city.'
Nick still scratched the side of his head.
The next moment, he turned towards the direction of the Dregs.
'Maybe I should just start asking around?'
After a couple of seconds, Nick just shrugged and walked towards the Dregs.
'Sure, why not?'
Wyntor looked through one of the windows at Nick, who was walking away.
'I hope he finds one,' Wyntor thought with furrowed brows.
'And I also hope the one he finds isn't too strong.'
After a while, Nick's surroundings became dirtier and dirtier, making him feel like he had come back home.
The Outer City had been a bit too clean for Nick.
It almost felt unnatural.
Eventually, Nick reached the marketplace where he had sat for months with his sign.
Today was not tax day, which meant that the marketplace was quite normal.
People were talking with each other but still keeping a safe distance.
After all, everyone could potentially be dangerous in the Dregs.
Nick scratched the side of his head again.
Eventually, someone just so happened to meet Nick's eyes, and Nick walked towards them.
The person Nick was walking to was a thin adult man who seemed like he regretted accidentally meeting Nick's eyes right now.
"Hey!" Nick said with a friendly tone. "I'm searching for a Specter."
Near the beginning, the man seemed annoyed and uninterested, but when he heard the word Specter, he became nervous.
"A Specter? Which one?!" he asked with worry.
"Ehm, I don't really know?" Nick said with uncertainty.
This confused the man. "What? But you just said you were searching for one!"
"I mean, yeah," Nick answered with an awkward laugh. "You see, I am a new Zephyx Extractor, and I'm searching for my first Specter, you know?"
When the man heard that, he calmed down a bit, but then, he became angry.
"Then stop talking like you lost a Specter! I thought I was in danger or something!" he shouted.
"Yes, yes, sorry and stuff," Nick said as he tried to sound nice. "So, you got any hints?"
"No," the man answered with annoyance, "and even if I had any, why would I give them to you? I would just tell the Investigators. At least they would give me enough money for the next couple of payments."
Nick could only sigh.
The Investigators were people who worked for Zephyx Manufacturers, and their job was to find clues about Specters.
Naturally, a couple of Zephyx Manufacturers had already opened some kind of service point where the residents of the city could give them clues regarding Specters.
And Nick?
What did Nick have to offer?
Literally nothing.
"Thanks anyway," Nick said with a sigh.
The man snorted when he heard Nick. Apparently, he was still a bit angry about the scare Nick had given him.
Nick left the man behind and went to a clerk from one of the stalls.
That clerk basically said the same thing.
He was annoyed that Nick was wasting his time with useless talk and told Nick that he would just go to the Investigators if he had some clues.
After asking a couple more people, Nick realized that there was really basically nothing he could gain from talking to the people.
They would all just contact the Investigators because of the money.
Sure, Nick could probably ask Wyntor for some money to pay the people, but how many people would actually trust Nick's words, and more importantly, how many of the clues would actually lead to Specters?
After over two hours of asking around, Nick still hadn't found a clue regarding a Specter.
Eventually, Nick just decided to patrol.
The people were of no help anyway.
Nick walked through several small and remote alleyways, and the floor became more and more unstable.
The Dregs were way too big for the number of people that lived here.
The issue was the amount of money in circulation and the available food.
Theoretically, if two people lived in one house, just this part of the Dregs could hold over 10,000 people.
Yet, there were barely 2,000.
Because of that, there were plenty of abandoned places in the Dregs.
Usually, there was no point in going there.
Everything worthwhile had already been looted and stolen, while Specters hunted humans, which meant that they were also more likely to be amongst humans.
And the abandoned Dregs basically didn't have any humans.
Yet, Nick was already out of options, and this was the best thing he could do right now.
Maybe a Specter had its nest and hiding place in the abandoned parts and only went amongst humans when they were hungry?
"Hey."
When Nick heard that voice, his brows furrowed.
"What do you want?" Nick asked in annoyance as he looked at one of the broken plates of rusty metal.
A moment later, the small head of a rat poked out of a hole in the plate.
"I heard you were searching for a weak Specter," the rat said with a grin.
"I am," Nick said.
Naturally, Nick knew exactly who he was talking to right now.
The Parasite.
The Specter that tried to convince him to kill himself.
"I know of a couple," the rat said with a chuckle. "Interested?"
Nick raised one of his eyebrows.
"I am," he said after some hesitation.
"Alright," the rat said with a grin.
"I want five bodies."
"Bring me five bodies that have not been killed by Nurse Alice, and I will tell you where you can find a fitting one."



Chapter 12 Morals
Nick scratched his chin for a bit.
The rat looked with interest at Nick.
"Not interested," Nick said after a bit.
"Oh, come on," the rat shouted, but it still didn't dare to leave its little hole. "It's just five bodies! You don't even need to kill them yourself!"
"No, killing is forbidden," Nick answered.
"So?" the rat asked. "Who cares?"
"I do," Nick said. "I am a real Zephyx Extractor now. I can't do such shady stuff."
The rat blinked very slowly.
"What?" it asked in a disbelieving and deadpan voice. "Extractors kill the most people. They can basically kill whoever they want. They just need to pay a fine for it."
Nick scratched the back of his head. "I mean, I get it, but I don't like it."
"It feels dirty."
The rat looked like it couldn't believe what Nick was saying.
"What are you talking about? I literally saw you kill that guy from the Insurance Gang and dump his body in the ruins!" the rat shouted.
"Ruins?" Nick asked.
"The sewers! The stuff below the grates you're walking on!" the rat shouted with annoyance.
"Oh, that," Nick said. "Yeah, I killed him, but that was because he was trying to collect information on me. It was self-defense."
"Self-defense? The guy was just looking at your house! You punched his face in before he could even do anything!"
"Yeah, like I said, self-defense!" Nick answered with annoyance. "He went against me, and I answered in kind."
The rat scratched on the grate below it with annoyance. "Okay, fine! It was self-defense! Then, go out and make some enemies and self-defend yourself into five corpses!"
"No," Nick answered.
Silence.
"Why?" the rat asked.
"I don't want to kill people that haven't done anything to me."
"I have morals, you know!" Nick shouted with a serious tone.
"Morals," the rat repeated with annoyance.
"Yes, morals," Nick answered.
"Okay," the rat said. "Then go purchase five corpses or something. Your employer looks like he has money."
"Can't," Nick answered. "We are not allowed to keep the corpses."
"Also, I heard that the entire city is basically looking for you, and if anyone found out that I purchased some corpses to hand them to you, the city would probably kill me."
The rat took a deep breath.
"Okay, okay," it said. "Anyway, my offer still stands. If you are ever interested in some information, just give me some corpses. I don't care where they come from. As long as they are human and have not been killed by Nurse Alice, I am fine with any."
"Anyway, good luck finding a Specter without me," the rat said with a snort before it vanished back into its hole.
When Nick heard that, he furrowed his brows again and scratched the back of his head.
He really didn't like his current situation.
Just now, the Parasite had given him a chance to find a Specter, but he had declined.
In the end, Nick could only sigh and accept his circumstances.
Of course, as someone who had lived in the Dregs for his entire life, Nick was a very practical person.
Naturally, he had considered the Parasite's offer seriously.
However, no matter how he reasoned with himself, Nick just couldn't accept helping the Parasite.
The Parasite was a Specter that killed a great number of humans.
Essentially, it was preying on the weak.
Over the years, Nick had looked at the huge pyramid that symbolized the Inner City countless times, and whenever he saw the difference between it and the Dregs, he felt very similar.
Just based on how the tax system worked, Nick could tell that the rich Zephyx Manufacturers in the Inner City were preying on the weak and poor people of the Dregs.
This created a certain hatred for people who preyed on weaker ones.
If everyone could just give a little of their belongings, there wouldn't be so many dying people in the Dregs.
Naturally, Nick knew that this was a very naïve ideology. Something like this would never happen.
Yet, even if the ideology was naïve, it was still what Nick wished for.
Nick couldn't change the world, but he could live his own life after his own standards, at least.
And Nick wouldn't take advantage of the weak people.
Taking advantage of the ones in power, like the Gangs, sure, but not of the weak ones.
Would it be easier to just accept how the world was and go with the flow?
Of course.
'But I don't need things to be easy,' Nick thought. 'I'm strong enough to have morals.'
Nevertheless, Nick threw one last glance at the hole where the rat had just been.
He felt a bit of regret.
Someone with Nick's knowledge and strength could probably find five corpses without being found.
But in the end, Nick just couldn't do it.
So, Nick just continued walking through the alleyways.
Eventually, the metal below Nick's feet became so unstable that he had to stop.
By now, Nick was pretty close to the huge wall around the city.
Rows upon rows of silver cameras lined the top of the walls, and they were looking in and out of the city.
Naturally, several cameras were also pointing at Nick at the moment.
However, that wasn't anything unusual.
After a bit, Nick just turned around and left this part of the Dregs again.
Nick looked for a different abandoned part and continued his search there.
Hours passed.
Still nothing.
Nick returned home, ate something, and went to bed.
The next day, he continued searching.
Nothing.
The next day, he went and talked to different people all day.
Nobody had anything of value to say.
Nick also met an Investigator that day, who only laughed at Nick.
The Investigators had already found out that Nick was searching for Specters, and apparently, Nick had become a joke within their ranks.
They found it quite hilarious that some unknown guy from the Dregs was searching for Specters while he was up against several huge companies with hundreds of employees.
Nick didn't talk to the Investigator.
Another day passed.
Another day passed.
Another day passed.
Nothing.
Nick found absolutely nothing.
Yet, Nick didn't give up.
He still continued searching.
There had to be something, somewhere!
If Nick didn't find something, his future would become grey and empty again!
Nick wanted to make something of his life, and for that to happen, he needed to find something.
He wouldn't give up!
No matter how long it took!



Chapter 13 Job Offer
Nick kept going to the marketplace and asking people for several days.
By now, many people were already telling him that they knew nothing before he could even ask his questions.
Constantly getting rejected by everyone didn't feel great, but Nick knew that he had to keep at it.
There had to be some weak Specters somewhere in the city.
Of course, the Inspectors also kept ridiculing Nick.
Yet, Nick never truly reacted to the ridicule.
He just kept on asking around and searching.
Ten days after Nick had started searching, some small things started to change.
The people had assumed a more neutral stance instead of directly telling Nick to go away.
On top of that, the Inspectors actually stopped making fun of Nick.
The reason for that was that the Inspectors were actually a bit impressed by Nick's grit.
Not many people could continue doing something after getting shut down by literally everyone around them.
Another two days later, one of the Inspectors actually stopped in front of Nick.
It was a middle-aged man with black hair and a goatee.
His build could be described as athletic. He wasn't thin, but he also wasn't fat.
"Nick, right?" the Inspector asked.
Nick just furrowed his brows and walked past the Inspector.
"Hey, wait a minute! I'm not here to ridicule you," the Inspector shouted.
Nick turned around and looked at the Inspector with a raised eyebrow.
"I've heard from my people that you have been searching for a Specter for about two weeks," the Inspector said. "They are talking quite a lot about you. Near the beginning, it was mostly jokes and ridicule, but by now, quite a few of them actually admire your tenacity."
Nick just nodded. "Thanks. Is there anything else?"
The eyebrows of the Inspector rose, but the next second, he just chuckled a bit in amusement. "So curt and off-putting. Well, you are from the Dregs, after all."
Nick didn't like the condescending tone of the Inspector and just turned around to walk away.
The Inspector just chuckled a bit.
"Want a job?"
Nick stopped walking, and his brows furrowed as he turned back to look at the Inspector. "A job?"
"Yes, as an Inspector," the Inspector said. "Even though you don't know the nuances of finding clues of Specters, your tenacity and grit are commendable."
"Teaching someone how to do something isn't difficult. Teaching them how to gain tenacity and grit is."
"I'm offering you a position as an Inspector in my team," the man said. "Interested?"
Naturally, Nick was interested.
Sure, he had already signed a contract with Wyntor Melfion, but his relationship with Wyntor was strictly business.
"I already have an attuned Zephyx Synchronizer. Is there a way for me to become a Zephyx Extractor in the future?" Nick asked.
The Inspector's eyes rose, and he looked at Nick again.
Only now did the Inspector take conscious note of Nick's formidable muscles.
He had heard that Nick was a new Zephyx Extractor, but after looking more closely at the business Nick was in, the Inspector could just shake his head.
There were only two people in there, and one of them was Nick.
They didn't even have a Specter.
In essence, Nick wasn't even an official Zephyx Extractor at this point. After all, he hadn't extracted even one unit of Zephyx.
There were several people in the Dregs with attuned Zephyx Synchronizers. There were not many, but there were definitely over ten.
It wasn't unusual for someone to come into contact with a Specter.
Yet, none of these people could become actual Zephyx Extractors.
It took way more than just that.
So, the Inspector hadn't considered Nick special.
But after meeting Nick face to face, the Inspector realized that Nick actually didn't seem weak.
He had tenacity, a strong body, guts, and willpower.
He could actually become a Zephyx Extractor.
Sadly…
The Inspector could only sigh. "While it happens occasionally, Inspectors don't often become Extractors, and the few ones that do don't have attuned Synchronizers."
"I can't make the decision on that, but based on my personal experience, I would say the chances are very low."
"Sorry."
Nick furrowed his brows and looked at the ground.
Even though Nick had just essentially heard that he wouldn't become a Zephyx Extractor, he was still a bit tempted to accept the offer.
What was Nick's goal in life?
Right now, Nick only wanted to have a nice future.
He didn't want to worry about money.
He didn't want to constantly be on guard because somebody might break into his house to kill him.
Nick just wanted an easier and more colorful life.
Nick knew that an Inspector didn't come close to an Extractor in terms of payment and status, but it was a solid job, at least.
That was something that no one living in the Dregs could claim to have.
While the lowest-ranking Inspectors didn't live in the Inner City, they definitely could live in the actual Outer City.
Normal houses.
Normal food.
Normal work.
It was already a major step up from living in the Dregs.
And yet…
"I'm sorry," Nick said with a sigh. "I can't accept."
"Can you tell me why?" the Inspector asked.
"I don't exactly know why," Nick answered. "I only know that I want to give life my best shot."
"I actually want to see if I can capture a Specter and become a real Zephyx Extractor."
"If I don't try, I will forever regret it."
"And if I fail, I can still accept, right? It's not like this is only a one-time offer," Nick explained.
The Inspector sighed. "No, it isn't. Naturally, if you want the position, just tell any of the local Inspectors."
Nick nodded. "Then, thank you for the offer and for understanding. I'm genuinely sorry that I can't accept at this moment."
The Inspector nodded. "No problem," he said.
"Then, have a good one," Nick said as he turned around to walk away.
As the Inspector watched Nick turn around, he seemed to struggle with something.
It was like an inner conflict was currently taking place in the Inspector's mind.
For a while, the Inspector just looked at Nick.
When he saw Nick walk up to a person he had already asked twice in the last ten days, the Inspector sighed again.
"Nick, come over here," he said, waving Nick over.
Nick stopped and looked back at the Inspector.
After a bit, Nick turned around and walked up to the Inspector.
"Yes?" he asked.
The Inspector scratched the side of his head with a bitter smile.
"How important is this to you?" the Inspector asked.
Nick furrowed his brows. "Pretty important. It's my life, you know?"
"How good are you in dark places?" the Inspector asked.
Nick looked to the side.
The Nightmare, one of the five level nine Specters, was omnipresent, and whenever anyone entered a dark place, the Nightmare would start to poison their minds with doubt, hatred, anger, and all manners of negative emotions.
Everyone avoided the dark.
"It's difficult to resist," Nick answered.
"Can you survive for an hour without any major trauma?" the Inspector asked.
Nick furrowed his brows again.
He didn't answer for a while.
"Not sure."
The Inspector looked at Nick with concern for a couple of seconds.
But then, he sighed.
"I know where you can find a Specter."
"And it shouldn't be that powerful."



Chapter 14 The Dreamer
Nick and the Inspector walked to the side into an abandoned alleyway.
Nick was highly interested in what the Inspector had to say.
After nearly two weeks, Nick had finally found a clue!
When they arrived in the alleyway, Nick just nodded at the Inspector.
The Inspector looked around.
"I'm not supposed to tell you about this," the Inspector said. "Information regarding Specters is top secret."
"Why are you telling me?" Nick asked.
"Well, there are a couple of reasons."
"First, I feel like I should help you a bit. I kind of feel bad for you when I see you try this desperately to find a Specter."
"Two, the Specter isn't being hunted by the Manufacturers anyway. This means that nobody would really miss it."
"And third, I don't fully agree with my employer's goal," the Inspector explained.
"Their goal?" Nick asked.
The Inspector nodded. "There are many Specters that we know about but don't capture. There are multiple reasons for that."
"Sometimes, it's incredibly difficult to find the actual location of the Specters. The Parasite is a good example. The entire city is after the Parasite, but nobody managed to track it down."
"Another reason is that some of the Specters are incredibly difficult to contain, and it's even more difficult to keep them contained. While there are Containment Units that can keep some Force Specters contained, there are still some of them that can't be contained."
"For example, outside the city is a Specter we call the Swallowing Swamp. It's just a huge swamp that's several kilometers wide. In order to contain that, we would need to commit monumental amounts of resources to it, which wouldn't be worth it."
"Some Specters are also just too powerful. Nurse Alice is a great example."
"And then, there are Specters that are living in places that are too difficult to get to. The one I'm going to tell you about is part of that category."
Nick became quite interested. "Where is it?"
The Inspector pointed at the floor, or more specifically, at the darkness beyond the metal grates everyone was walking on.
"The sewers," the Inspector said.
Nick also looked at the ground.
Since the floor was essentially made of metallic grates, everyone could see and smell the sewers.
In a way, the sewers didn't really look like sewers.
In truth, just a couple of meters below the grates, there was just a sea of horrible and dirty water.
If anyone broke a grate and fell through, they would fall for about ten meters and then plummet into a deep pile of water filled with piss, shit, waste, garbage, and so on.
There were cases where some of the victims were rescued, but most of them died quickly.
In general, the people started to puke violently, which often made them accidentally swallow more of the water. This increased their panic, and they started to rapidly splash around.
Oftentimes, they hit some kind of old and rusty nail, which then cut them open.
Additionally, the Parasite's minions, the rats, often piled onto the victim.
Falling into the sewers was a terrifying death.
Even more, not all of the floor was made of grates. There were also plenty of places with plates instead of grates.
If one had exceptionally bad luck, one might fall into a dark part of the sewers.
At that point, the Nightmare's influence also attacked them.
"In the sewers?" Nick asked.
The Inspector nodded.
Nick's heart rate increased, and he had to take a deep breath.
"Where is it exactly?" Nick asked.
"Are you really willing to jump into the sewers?" the Inspector asked with concern.
Nick took another deep breath.
Nick imagined himself standing in front of a hole, looking at the murky and dark liquid below.
Just the stench would make a normal person retch.
Jumping into that...
The mental image was horrifying.
To be honest, Nick hesitated a while.
It wasn't easy to jump into something like that.
The only good thing was that nobody would be seeing Nick down there, which would allow him to keep his unique ability active.
This meant that drowning or getting pricked by a sharp piece of metal was no real concern.
Nick's body became five times as powerful when no one was looking. That also meant that the durability of his skin and muscles increased.
As long as he didn't ram into a metallic spike jutting out of a solid wall with all his force, Nick wouldn't get wounded.
The rats also weren't that big of a problem.
Yes, the Parasite had a lot of rats, but every rat was valuable.
The rats would be able to overwhelm Nick, but Nick would take many of them with him.
Nick was quite sure that it wouldn't be worth the trade.
So, while the sewers were incredibly disgusting and horrifying, they were not actually a danger to Nick.
However, two other things would still prove to be very dangerous.
One, the Specter itself, whatever it was.
No Specter was weak, and Nick needed to overwhelm the Specter, catch it, and bring it back to the surface.
Two, the darkness.
The sewers were dimly lit at best, and there were also many places that were completely dark.
The darker the place, the greater the Nightmare's influence.
The Nightmare's powers affected every single human in the world.
It didn't matter how strong someone was.
Whether they were a normal person or one of the most powerful Extractors in the world.
All of them were affected by the Nightmare equally.
Power didn't matter.
Only mental fortitude mattered.
Nick would need to resist the Nightmare's influence for a prolonged period of time while also actively searching for the Specter.
Nick only looked to the side.
'He said that the Specter should be on my level, which means it's a level one Specter.'
'For a level one Specter, someone has to jump into the sewers and resist the Nightmare's influence. I can imagine that it wouldn't be worth the effort.'
Nick remained silent for several seconds.
"You know," the Inspector said.
Nick looked back.
"Maybe I misrepresented my reasons for helping you a bit," the Inspector added.
"The reasons I mentioned earlier still hold true, but the order might not be the most accurate."
"The thing I'm actually most concerned about is the last reason."
Nick only looked at the Inspector.
"When we find such a Specter," the Inspector explained, "my employer makes a risk assessment. Is it worth to go after it? What are the dangers? What is the potential profit?"
"Since this is only a level one Specter, it obviously isn't worth it. Because of that, we are just going to ignore the Specter."
"That is until it becomes a level three Specter."
Nick narrowed his eyes.
"You're saying that they want the Specter to feed on the population of the Dregs until it becomes a level three Specter?" Nick asked.
The Inspector looked to the side.
"Well, my employer is a business, and all businesses are made for profit. When there is no profit to be gained, we don't get involved."
"My employer isn't letting the Specter live just so that it can become more powerful."
"My employer just doesn't get involved since it's not worth it."
"My employer is not responsible for keeping the city safe. It's a business, not a charity. It's not my employer's job to protect the people."
Nick's demeanor didn't improve. "And if your employer told the city about the Specter?"
The Inspector didn't immediately answer.
"The city might do something about it," the Inspector added.
"But they would need to pay quite a hefty sum in return."
"Also, maybe one day, the Specter might become profitable enough to catch."
Nick didn't need to hear more.
Naturally, the Inspector wasn't allowed to speak ill of his employer, which was why he was wording it this vaguely, but Nick basically got the gist.
The Inspector's employer was willing to feed people to the Specter until it grew more powerful.
And the Inspector didn't like that.
Which was why he was telling Nick about it.
Earlier, Nick had still been on the fence, but now, not anymore.
"I'm doing it," Nick said.
The Inspector looked into Nick's eyes for a while.
The Inspector saw that they were filled with a bit of fear but also a lot of conviction.
The Inspector took a deep breath.
"It's called the Dreamer."



Chapter 15 Jumping In
Nick and Wyntor stood in front of a destroyed street.
The Inspector had told Nick everything he knew about the Dreamer already, and Nick had also informed Wyntor.
As always, the sun was in the middle of the sky, and yet, the sea of toxic waste still seemed dark.
This part of the Dregs was abandoned, and the road had broken into many pieces, creating a sort of ramp towards the sewers.
Nick chose this spot since he also needed a place from where he could return.
At this moment, Wyntor was holding his nose with a white handkerchief, and he looked with disgust and concern at the dirty and grimy water.
The two of them looked at the disgusting water washing across the broken and lowered metal plates and grates for several seconds.
"And you're sure you want to accompany me?" Nick asked as he looked at Wyntor.
Wyntor didn't immediately answer.
"You really don't have to," Nick added. "As the Chief Zephyx Extractor, this is my job, not yours."
Wyntor just kept looking at the disgusting water.
He took several deep breaths.
Then, he started to retch and cough.
Yet, Wyntor kept looking at the dirty water.
A moment later, his legs shook a bit.
And finally, he sighed.
"I'm sorry," he said.
"It's fine," Nick said with a nod. "It's not your job."
"Nick, I'm really genuinely sorry," Wyntor added. "I honestly want to go with you, but I just can't."
"I don't have the courage."
"Sorry."
"It's fine, dude," Nick said with a bit of annoyance. "You can just stay here until I return. If I am accompanied by something that's attacking me, you can help me with that."
"I will," Wyntor answered with a nod.
After Nick had signed the NDA, Wyntor had also told Nick about his ability.
As one of the heirs to the Melfion family, Wyntor had received something to protect himself.
Wyntor's Zephyx Synchronizer was also already attuned to a Specter.
However, the ability the Specter gave people was not something that was very useful for a Zephyx Extractor.
It was basically only good for running away from someone.
Nevertheless, it was still very good at what it did.
While Wyntor couldn't capture any Specter on his own, he could still debilitate and weaken it.
Naturally, Wyntor had received that ability for two reasons.
First, his parents wanted Wyntor to have something that could protect him.
Second, they didn't want Wyntor to become a Zephyx Extractor, and the best way was for Wyntor's Synchronizer to already be occupied with a relatively useless ability for Extractors.
"If I see anything attacking you, I will immediately support you," Wyntor said with conviction.
Nick just nodded.
"Also, since I'm not accompanying you, I might as well give you these," Wyntor said as he took out three long tubes of glass.
Nick looked at them with furrowed brows. "What's that?"
"Arclight," Wyntor answered.
"And how will that help me?" Nick asked. "Everyone knows that artificial light sources don't help against the Nightmare."
"This is different," Wyntor said as he pointed at the three long tubes. "Each one is harvested from a level three Specter. They actually help against the Nightmare."
This surprised Nick quite a bit.
"Be careful with them," Wyntor added. "Each one costs around 10,000 credits, and they only work for a minute each."
"If you feel like you can't handle the Nightmare's influence anymore, just break one of them. An area of light will appear around you, but it will dissipate after around a minute."
"The Containment Unit and building already consumed most of my budget, and I can't afford more of these Arclights without jeopardizing our daily operations. Use them when necessary."
Nick looked at the three glass tubes with newfound appreciation and bound them to his thigh.
"Thanks," Nick said.
"Good," Wyntor said with a nod. "I hope everything turns out well for you."
"Thanks," Nick repeated.
Then, Nick took a deep breath.
At the same time, Wyntor turned around.
In order for Nick's powers to activate, Wyntor also wasn't allowed to see him.
For the next couple of seconds, Nick took several deep breaths.
Finally, Nick put on some diving goggles that Wyntor had bought him and jumped forward.
Nick could have just walked into the murky pool of water, but he feared that he would turn around if he came into contact with a bit of the liquid.
So, he decided to directly jump in.
SPLASH!
The splash was noticeably more lethargic and subdued compared to the typical splash of water.
It was just too viscous.
Thanks to his ability, Nick easily jumped forward for over five meters without needing a running start.
As soon as Nick touched the murky liquid, all his senses fired at the same time.
Nick felt several small pieces of cloth touch his skin.
He had also hit two small but solid objects, which were quickly pushed away by his body.
The next moment, Nick felt how incredibly sticky the liquid was.
In a way, it felt like the liquid was trying to trap him in place.
Some of the liquid went into Nick's ears and nose, and he had to do his best to resist the urge to vomit.
Disgusting.
All of Nick's body shouted at him that this was disgusting.
It was so bad.
However, instead of immediately panicking, Nick remained motionless in the liquid first.
He knew that he had to get acclimated.
Nick had already pulled his knees to his chest to make the surface area of his body as small as possible, but his body was still violently shaking.
He wanted to throw up so badly.
He just wanted to push his head above the surface and scream.
Yet, Nick just remained stationary.
For several seconds, Nick didn't move.
During these seconds, he felt several small pieces of cloth get caught by his body.
Finally, Nick slowly extended his body.
As he felt his chest and thighs come into contact with the liquid, his body shuddered again.
And then, Nick slowly swam upwards.
Splash!
Nick's head broke the surface, but he didn't immediately open his eyes. He knew that he was wearing diving goggles, but he had still closed his eyes.
Over the next seconds, Nick slowly opened his eyes as he looked upward.
Brown and green liquid was sparkling as the light of the sun shone through them.
Nick saw small pieces of bandages, and he even saw a couple of small pieces of bone on his diving goggles.
Piss, shit, bandages, bones, teeth, blood, rotten meat, insects, poisons, splinters, rusty metal, puke.
Together with water, all of that was creating the pool of liquid Nick was currently in.
A moment later, Nick slowly wiped his goggles, mouth, and nose clean.
Or, at least, as clean as he could.
Finally, Nick took a deep breath.
Surprisingly, the smell didn't feel as bad as before.
But that was the only positive thing.
"Nick, is everything alright?" Wyntor shouted, still turned away from Nick.
Nick took another deep breath.
"I'm fine," he answered.
"Good," Wyntor shouted back.
"I'm going to search now," Nick shouted.
"Good luck!" Wyntor shouted back.
The next moment, Nick took another deep breath.
And then, he swam forward, towards the endless depths of the sewers.



Chapter 16 Ruins
Nick swam forward in silence.
From time to time, he could hear the sound of someone walking on the road above him, but that was about it.
All the other sounds were just the liquid sloshing around Nick's body and face.
CRK!
Nick's shin suddenly hit something solid, but thanks to his ability, his shin didn't receive any real damage.
The next moment, Nick stopped and used his feet to see what was below him. After all, the liquid was so murky that he couldn't even see further than ten centimeters.
Nick's feet found something big and stable beneath him.
In fact, Nick could even stand on it, allowing his torso to rise above the murky liquid.
'Wonder what that is,' Nick thought as he continued wading across the stable foothold.
Splash!
But after some seconds, Nick lost his footing and fell forward.
A moment later, Nick shot upward and scrambled back onto the stable foothold.
'It's in my mouth!'
Nick immediately started retching uncontrollably, and it only stopped over two minutes later.
'Note to self, don't breathe in while walking forward,' Nick thought.
'Anyway, seems like my foothold ended after about ten meters.'
'I guess that's the size of a house.'
A moment later, Nick decided to walk along the edge of the perceived building he was walking on, and within a minute, Nick had mapped out what he was standing on.
'Sure enough, it's a house,' Nick thought.
But then, Nick furrowed his brows. 'However, the form is unusual, and it's made of stone or brick instead of metal.'
'Almost all houses have a slanted roof because of the rainwater, but the roof of this one is perfectly flat.'
'Even more, all the houses above me are made of metal.'
'A house made of something as luxurious as stone would be far too expensive for the people living in the Dregs. Even the houses in the actual Outer City are mostly made of metal, albeit rust-free.'
That was when Nick remembered what the Parasite had said.
The Parasite had called the sewers ruins at some point.
'Ruins,' Nick thought. 'I guess this stone house is part of the ruins then.'
'But why are there buildings down here?'
'Obviously, no one is living down here. Yet, there are still valuable and functional houses.'
'Even more, the sewers wouldn't have swallowed everything if we had just lived in the houses to begin with.'
'Why did someone build a metallic city above this one?'
'I don't know,' Nick thought after some seconds, 'but one thing is clear.'
'Humans have lived here before.'
Nick looked around a bit.
'I want to know how big the house is.'
The next moment, Nick went to the edge of the house, took a deep breath, and dove down.
Nick's hands grabbed the rough stone of the house and pulled him downward.
Since no one was watching him, Nick easily managed to pull himself downward.
After descending for around ten meters, Nick reached the bottom, but when he felt it, he furrowed his brows in surprise.
'Metal?'
'The ground is made of metal here as well?'
The Dregs were buildings made of rusty metal sitting on top of grates and plates of rusty metal.
Below that, Nick imagined a stone house sitting on top of more metal.
'Then, is there even more?'
Nick pulled back and kicked the floor with all his power.
BOOOM!
The ground vibrated, but Nick suddenly felt pain in his leg.
He knew all too well where that pain came from.
He had hit something that was way too hard.
'This feels just as hard as the metal that Wyntor's Containment Unit is made of! I think he called it steel.'
'A house made of stone on top of a floor made of steel. This sounds way better than the rusty metal of the Dregs.'
Nick thought about this for a while.
'There's not enough information.'
A moment later, Nick shot towards the surface to get a "fresh" breath of air before returning underground.
Over the next few minutes, Nick mapped out the building. He even found the door and some windows.
'Sure enough, it's a residential house,' Nick thought.
By now, Nick had acclimated to the disgusting liquid, and as long as it didn't get into his mouth, he could keep his disgust in check.
As Nick looked down at the house below him, he suddenly got the urge to investigate further.
'Maybe there is some treasure inside?'
'Maybe there are some secrets to uncover?'
But then, Nick felt a bit of crackling from beneath his feet.
The house wasn't breaking apart, but it definitely wasn't stable.
That was when Nick realized something crucial.
'That's dumb!'
'There's no way anything valuable would be left! After all, the people who moved here to build the city must have cleared everything out already!'
The next moment, Nick narrowed his eyes.
Then, he remembered when this feeling had actually occurred.
While Nick had been deep below the surface, he had already had the urge to investigate the house.
In fact, the urge had been the strongest when Nick had found the door.
'It's already started.'
The liquid was so incredibly murky that no light reached a depth of even just two meters.
This meant that Nick had been in pure darkness down there.
'The Nightmare.'
The Nightmare's influence could be subtle or noticeable, whichever was more useful.
Naturally, the Nightmare had influenced Nick in a very subtle manner down there, slowly planting ideas into his head of riches and secrets.
If Nick had followed these urges, he would have been in quite a lot of danger.
The house was not stable, and even more, the Nightmare could also warp someone's perception and create illusions.
It could have made Nick move in a different direction than he wanted, and without being able to see or hear down there, Nick wouldn't be able to find his way out.
In the end, he might become panicked and break through the wall, but then, the house might collapse on top of him.
'The Nightmare has already influenced me.'
Nick took a deep breath.
'I have to be careful.'
The next moment, Nick decided to stop investigating the ruins below him.
Without a constant source of light, investigating the ruins was far too dangerous.
'I can look at them at some other time.'
'For now, I should look for the Dreamer.'



Chapter 17 Rules of the Sewer
Nick focused on searching for the Dreamer.
'The Investigator doesn't know what the Dreamer looks like exactly, but he said that he knows it can fly.'
'Physical and Possession Specters of the first level are not nearly powerful enough to fly without wings, which means that the Specter is most likely a winged creature of some sort.'
As Nick swam forward, he kept looking upward.
Naturally, the Dreamer most likely didn't reside inside the actual murky liquid.
'It's probably living inside some of these structures.'
Naturally, there had to be some support for all the metallic plates and grates that made up the floor of the Outer City.
These supports came in the form of long and wide pillars of rusty metal, but they were not the only kinds of support.
Nick had already found a couple of other ruins jutting out of the liquid.
For example, there was a wide building made of stone that seemed to touch or fuse into the metallic plates above it.
There were also several other sizable buildings made of metal and stone jutting out of the pool.
While most of the normal pillars ended in a part of the street with a couple of plates, the sizable ruins that supported the city often ended in big areas of plates.
There were no grates for over ten meters around these big structures.
Additionally, most floors below the actual buildings in the dregs were also made of plates instead of grates.
In a way, since the sun was directly above Nick at all times, the map of the Dregs was reflected on the murky liquid in the form of shadows and big areas of darkness.
While Nick was swimming through the sewers, he was essentially following the roads of the Dregs above him.
It had a kind of bizarre sense of order.
Sadly, this meant that Nick couldn't fully investigate every part of the sewers without having to enter the darkness.
Many buildings were often clumped together, and since the people wanted to avoid the rising smell of the sewers as much as possible, they also replaced their floors with plates.
This created areas of pure darkness over a hundred meters wide.
Naturally, there were also ruins and supports in these areas, and Nick couldn't see much from a distance.
Nick was in the light, and if he wanted to look into the darkness, his eyes had to acclimate to darkness first.
This meant that he had to enter the darkness if he wanted to see in the darkness.
But for now, Nick avoided the darkness.
He would only enter when it was necessary.
Nick remained on the "streets" as he continued to search for any movement above him.
The good thing about the sewers was that they were so incredibly toxic and disgusting that not even insects came here.
The only movement Nick saw came from the rats scuttling across the ceiling of the sewers.
Surprisingly, not even the rats were swimming in the liquid.
Instead, they were scuttling across the metallic grates with their claws.
In fact, there were quite a lot of them.
In a certain way, these rats were the pedestrians of the sewers since they also followed the roads.
While Specters were not being hunted by the Nightmare, most of their minions were.
So, even the minions of a powerful Specter, like the Parasite, had to avoid the dark places.
Luckily, none of the rats were looking at Nick, keeping his ability active.
In the beginning, some of them had looked at him out of curiosity, but after Nick had thrown them a glare, they turned around.
If the Parasite annoyed Nick too much, Nick might decide to hunt its rats.
So, out of politeness, the Parasite tried to ignore Nick.
As long as it didn't antagonize Nick, Nick wouldn't antagonize it.
That was their unspoken agreement.
For several hours, Nick continued searching for the Dreamer.
The sewers were kilometers upon kilometers long, but luckily, not all the flooring was made of grates.
The Dregs didn't surround the city. After all, no city would want every single visitor to travel through the absolute worst place they had.
So, while the sewers covered most of the underground of the city, the Dregs were only about two kilometers wide and three kilometers long.
Nick was quite certain that the Dreamer didn't go outside the sewers below the Dregs.
First of all, the other parts of the cities had far more Zephyx Extractors, and if any of them found a level one Specter appearing near them, they would hunt it down.
Every Specter represented an incredible amount of wealth!
Additionally, the nicer parts of the town had the sewers completely isolated, making it impossible for the Dreamer to surface.
This meant that the Dreamer had to focus on the Dregs.
'By now, it should be late evening,' Nick thought.
The sun didn't move, but Nick's inner clock was telling him that it was getting late.
'According to the Inspector, the Dreamer has received its name due to the method it uses to hunt and feed.'
'Once a night, it leaves its nest and visits a sleeping person.'
'While they are asleep, the Dreamer creates terrifying nightmares for them but doesn't allow them to wake up.'
'For several hours, the person is stuck inside a terrifying nightmare.'
'The next day, the person wakes up again, but they feel even more tired than before they went to bed. Naturally, they also need a long time to recover from the mental stress.'
'Since it's already late in the evening, the first people should already be going to bed.'
'In at most a couple of hours, the Dreamer should leave its nest to feed.'
'That's when I can find it.'
'Sadly, I also need to reach it and sneak up on it.'
'That won't be easy.'
'But for now, I should wait.'
Nick went to one of the ruins that were below some grates and grabbed the edge.
Then, Nick slightly pulled himself down so that only his nose and eyes poked out.
He didn't want the Dreamer to see him when it searched for its food.
And like this, Nick waited.



Chapter 18 Nightmare
Nick waited for several hours in the horrible liquid.
During this time, he had a lot of time to think.
For example, he had thought about how he had ended up in this place.
Naturally, after being inside such a disgusting place for so long, Nick had questioned his life choices.
But in the end, Nick thought that it actually wasn't so bad. After all, he was currently trying to turn his life for the better.
The worse it was, the fewer regrets he would have in the future in case he decided to accept the Investigator job.
At least, he could say that he had even swam through a pool of piss and shit in an effort to become a Zephyx Extractor.
By now, it was deep in the night, but the sun still shone brightly in the sky.
Way fewer people were walking around above the grates, and Nick had also seen a drop in streams of piss and nuggets of shit coming down through the grates into the pool.
Yet, Nick still hadn't seen the Dreamer.
He constantly kept a lookout for its whereabouts, but Nick just couldn't find it anywhere.
'It should be 12 am. already,' Nick thought with furrowed brows. 'Most people should be asleep already, and there should be plenty of victims to choose from for the Dreamer.'
'Yet, I haven't seen anything fly around.'
'From this position, I can basically look at everything below the Dregs, but I still can't see anything flying around.'
Naturally, Nick grew worried.
Just to be safe, Nick waited for another two hours.
But still, nothing.
'It should be 2 am. now, but I still don't see anything.'
By now, even Nick's powerful and strengthened skin started to get itchy all over.
The liquid was a bit acidic, and Nick had been in it for over eight hours by now.
In the end, Nick surfaced with a helpless sigh.
'Since it's not flying around, this can basically mean only one thing.'
'Its nest is directly below its victim's home.'
'That means it doesn't need to fly around to feed.'
Nick looked around and focused on the several big and dark spots in his surroundings.
The direct beams of light coming from above Nick created shadowy squares when blocked by the houses of the Dregs.
In a way, they created shadows of the houses themselves.
But instead of being two-dimensional, it was like the shadows took up the entire space below the houses, creating a sort of black domain.
However, there were also a few houses with a couple of small grates, representing small spots of light.
These grates were mostly left in the houses as toilets.
'For now, I should focus on the houses with toilets.'
Nick created amap inside his head of the layout and started from the edge of the Dregs.
After swimming for a while, Nick stopped in front of the first dark place.
In front of Nick was a shadowy area, around twenty meters wide and fifty meters long.
There were two grates in that area of darkness.
Naturally, houses in the Dregs didn't get that big. This was simply a small block of houses with two toilets.
Nick took a deep breath.
And then, he swam forward.
Nick directly swam towards the beam of light in front of him, but he also kept looking around for the Dreamer.
He saw several pillars and even a ruin jotting out of the pool around him, and he looked at all of them.
The Dreamer probably wasn't very big, and it could probably even live on the sides of one of the rusty pillars.
Nick inspected all the pillars.
Suddenly, Nick's body shook, and he stopped moving forward.
In front of him, the pillars seemed to distort and morph into each other.
Just a couple of moments later, a terrifying grimace with teeth had been created, and it looked down at Nick with rage.
Nick's heart rate rose.
'That's the Nightmare! This is only an illusion!'
Yet, knowing that it was an illusion didn't help a lot.
Nick's terror was still very present and visible.
Someone with a phobia of spiders also knew that amost all the spiders weren't even dangerous.
Yet, their fear was still overpowering.
Nick was in a similar situation now.
He knew that the huge grimace floating above him was not real, but he still genuinely felt like he was about to die.
Nick's speed increased.
It was amost like his disgust for the liquid had vanished as he desperately tried to get away as quickly as possible.
"You're going to die!"
The darkest voice Nick had ever heard had just spoken that sentence, and Nick felt his mind shiver.
Yet, Nick just looked forward at the safe beam of light that was the toilet of the house.
"You're never going to reach it."
The next moment, Nick saw the beam of light slowly going away from him.
Nick's breathing quickened, and he didn't even care that some of the liquid entered his mouth at that moment.
He needed light!
Nick kept swimming.
And swimming.
And swimming.
Why hadn't he reached it yet?!
From the start, the toilet was barely ten meters away from him!
That took some seconds, but that was it!
Nick was quite sure that he had been swimming for over half aminute by now!
Where was the light?!
"Hahahahaha!"
The dark voice laughed as the light traveled further and further away from Nick until eventually…
It was gone.
There was no more light.
There was only darkness.
An endless forest of tall and rusty spires rose from the pool around Nick.
But that was it.
No matter in which direction Nick looked, he only saw an endless forest of rusty spires.
There was no escape.
The next moment, the grimace of spires slowly descended, its expression morphed into amalicious smile.
And then, it slowly moved towards Nick.
Nick knew all of this wasn't real, but he also knew that he would die if he stayed in the darkness.
The longer the Nightmare influenced people, the worse it got.
Nick turned around and swam away from the grimace.
He had to flee!
He was going to die!
"Hahahaha!"
The grimace laughed as it came closer.
No matter what Nick did, it was coming closer.
Nick closed his eyes in terror.
He would die!
'I'm sorry, Wyntor.'
'But I have to use it!'
Then, Nick grabbed one of the tubes of glass and broke it over his knee.



Chapter 19 The Second Swim
The next moment, Nick was bathed in light.
From black, everything transformed into white.
Nick's eyes burned due to the sudden influx of light, but they quickly adapted.
The next moment, the light became less bright, and Nick could finally look around.
'How did I end up here?' Nick thought with surprise.
Right now, Nick was between the two toilets when he had not even reached the first one.
'The Nightmare must have created more illusions that made me change my trajectory.'
Nick took a deep breath.
'As long as I enter a sizable area of darkness, the Nightmare can actually keep me perpetually trapped in it.'
'No wonder no one wanted to search for the Dreamer down here.'
'The danger is not the Dreamer.'
'The danger is the Nightmare.'
Nick noticed that the light was getting dimmer, and he was preparing to move forward again.
'I need to find a way to get to the toilet.'
A bit later, the light was nearly gone, and Nick shot forward again.
The pillars were transforming into the forest of rusty spires again.
However, Nick just kept swimming forward with all of his power.
The next moment, Nick saw something dark slowly rise out of the pool in front of him.
It was like a whale had just put its breathing hole a bit above the surface before submerging again.
Something was in the water, and it was big!
A second later, it rose again, but this time, it was angled towards Nick!
It was swimming towards him!
Nick gritted his teeth, ignoring the liquid that poured through his lips.
And then, he tightly shut his eyes.
But he continued swimming!
Everything became silent.
It was deathly silent.
The only thing moving was Nick.
He almost felt like he was in an endless void of nothingness.
Ding.
Nick's right knee hit something solid, but the object was pushed away.
However, Nick knew exactly what he had just hit.
It felt a bit soft but with a hard core.
It was a head!
A human head!
The next moment, Nick hit something again.
This time, it was an arm.
However, Nick just kept moving forward.
More and more body parts appeared in Nick's way, but he just batted them to the side.
"I'm sorry," the crying voice of a kid said quietly.
The next moment, a small arm grabbed Nick's ankle.
"I'm so sorry!" the kid shouted.
"Please, forgive me!"
The next moment, several other arms grabbed Nick.
They wanted to pull him into the depths!
"I'm sorry!"
"I'm sorry!"
"I'm sorry!"
A chorus of different but desperate voices shouted from all around Nick as the grips of the arms tightened.
Nick couldn't move anymore.
He had been completely immobilized!
Nick's terror reached new heights, but he only kept trying to swim forward.
That was the only thing that could save him!
Splash!
Nick was suddenly pulled under!
The arms tightened around him and continued pulling.
And then, Nick suddenly felt it.
Teeth!
Huge teeth!
Nick's legs hit a couple of teeth, and the teeth were almost a meter long!
Even more, Nick's body wasn't nearly strong enough to resist these teeth, and his legs started to bleed.
In his panic, Nick desperately tried to swim away, but the arms kept pulling him back.
Even more, the arms seemed to come out of this thing's mouth!
The arms were pulling him into the maw!
Nick felt the maw advance.
A deep shadow appeared around Nick as he was engulfed.
There was another Specter in here!
And this was not a level one Specter!
He would die!
He would die!
Nick felt himself get pulled further and further down into the maw.
And then…
Everything stopped.
Nick didn't move for several seconds.
But nothing happened.
Slowly, Nick opened his eyes.
And he saw light!
He was below one of the toilets!
'I did it!' Nick thought in shock.
'I actually did it!'
For several seconds, Nick just looked at the light above him.
He was safe!
There was no second Specter!
Splash!
Suddenly, something splashed in the liquid in front of Nick, and all his anxiety returned!
Nick looked down.
And then, he saw it.
A floater.
A turd.
The person in the house above him had just taken a shit.
Nick grimaced in disgust.
'Really? Now?'
And with that, all of Nick's elation was gone and replaced by annoyance.
'Anyway, I can look for the Dreamer now.'
Due to the extreme darkness, Nick couldn't see all parts of the ceiling from any one spot.
Because of that, he went to the little safe spots to search the ceiling.
The next moment, Nick poked his head into the darkness, but his body remained in the light.
The Nightmare's influence returned, but it was far weaker than before.
By moving his head out of the light like this, Nick could look at the 100 square meters above him with quite a lot of confidence.
However, since 100 square meters were only ten by ten meters, Nick needed to do this from several locations to check everything.
After he looked at the ceiling above him, Nick readied himself to swim towards the next toilet.
Obviously, the Dreamer wasn't here.
Nick took a deep breath and readied himself.
'I've done this before. Now, I just need to do it again!'
Then, Nick shot forward.
The terrors returned.
Nick closed his eyes.
CRKSH!
Nick stopped breathing as he felt some teeth tear a part out of his arm!
The pain was brutal and sharp.
Nick opened his eyes and looked at his right elbow.
His flesh had been torn off!
Only the bloody bone of his elbow was left!
'Is… is this real?' Nick thought.
'I've never heard that the Nightmare could do something like this before!'
'Right! The teeth of the maw also tore my legs open, but when I reached the light, there was nothing!'
'I have to keep swimming!'
Even though a huge part of Nick's arm had just vanished, he still continued swimming as he closed his eyes.
He had to reach the toilet!
The next moment, something tore Nick's leg off, and Nick was nearly pulled under by the force.
Nick wanted to scream due to the pain, but he just kept swimming forward.
He had to reach the light!
He had to reach it!
More and more of Nick's body was torn apart, and Nick wasn't even sure what he was anymore.
His being was so overwhelmed with pain that his mind even blacked out for some seconds.
He was dying.
He wanted to die.
But he wanted to live.
It was so bad.
It was so horrible.
Just move forward.
Just a bit.
Please.
Just a bit!
And then, everything stopped again.
Nick opened his eyes.
He had reached the second toilet.



Chapter 20 Too Much
Silence.
Nick just looked at the ceiling in silence.
He had expected that things wouldn't be as bad the second time.
He had been wrong.
Things had been even worse the second time.
Back when Nick had been underwater, the Nightmare had used subtle influences.
The next time, it had used horrors to stop Nick from moving to where he wanted.
Then, it created illusions of Nick losing control and being swallowed.
And now, it had just directly inflicted an unending amount of pain on him.
The Nightmare had lost all its subtlety.
It had transformed from horror into terror.
Nick just looked at the light at the ceiling.
He wasn't sure what he was feeling.
Fear, apprehension, relief, anxiety.
This wasn't like the last time.
The last time, Nick had been happy that he had managed to do it.
But this time, Nick was not happy.
The pain had been bad.
Real bad.
For several minutes, Nick didn't do anything.
He just looked at the ceiling with a worried expression.
He didn't want to feel such pain again.
He never wanted to feel something like that again.
Just now, his body had been torn apart one piece at a time.
This was a pain that should have killed someone.
But he was still alive.
…
…
Nick gulped in worry.
'I don't want to do this again.'
'How many times do I have to do this?'
'What will happen next?'
'I can barely swim for a bit more than ten meters in pure darkness, and it's already this bad.'
'This is one of the smaller blocks of houses.'
'There are blocks with no toilets, which means I have to look at the ceiling while under illusions.'
'And then, I need to go back.'
'Also, what about when I actually find the Dreamer at the ceiling in one of those?'
'At that point, I need to climb one of the pillars in pure darkness and catch it.'
'The Nightmare could easily show me illusions and make me move in the wrong direction.'
Nick just floated on the liquid as he looked up.
Silence.
'I don't know.'
'I have no idea how to find and catch the Dreamer.'
For over ten minutes, Nick didn't do anything.
Naturally, Nick knew that he couldn't spend the rest of his life in the light of this little toilet.
He had to leave at some point.
Yet, he just couldn't.
The terror he had felt just now was too much.
The pain was too much.
He was only 16 years old.
He had never undergone something this painful or terrifying.
This was not the work of some random weak Specter.
No, this was the Nightmare.
One of the only five level nine Specters.
Even the strongest Zephyx Extractors couldn't remain in the darkness for an extended period of time.
The Nightmare's power was absolute.
It had killed tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of people just by mentally breaking them.
It had killed people far more experienced and tenacious than Nick.
'I can't do it.'
Silence.
'I just can't do it.'
'I have to do this one more time to get out, but I don't think I can enter another block of houses.'
Nick felt his chest shiver and hurt.
Regret, frustration, self-loathing.
'I'm not strong enough to do this again.'
'I want to turn my life around, not end it.'
'If I go through something like this again, I don't know if I will ever recover.'
'What then?'
'I want to try my best, but if I fail, I fail.'
'It's fine.'
'I can become an Inspector.'
'It's not like I have some lofty and idealistic goal that requires me to become the strongest person in the world.'
'No, I just want to live a good life.'
'But what's the point of living a good life when I wake up in a cold sweat because I keep re-experiencing the things I have seen and felt here every night for the remainder of my life?'
Nick looked to the side at the block of darkness waiting for him.
And then, some tears appeared in Nick's eyes.
'I'm sorry.'
'I just can't do it.'
'I'm not strong enough.'
Silence.
The only sounds down here came from the quiet scratching of the rats' claws and Nick's crying.
It was just too much for him.
Nick had just started his journey as a Zephyx Extractor, and he had already confronted one of the five strongest Specters several times.
This wasn't something that he could deal with.
This was far beyond his current level.
He gave up.
For the next couple of minutes, Nick looked at the darkness around him.
Then, he moved his head into the darkness and did a routine scan of the ceiling.
Maybe he was lucky, and the Dreamer was actually here.
It wasn't.
Nick took a deep breath.
He only felt fear right now.
He didn't want to enter the darkness again.
But he had to.
He couldn't remain here for the remainder of his life.
Nick took another deep breath.
It took a couple minutes for him to gather his courage, but eventually, he shot into the darkness again.
As soon as Nick entered…
Nothing happened.
However, Nick didn't let down his guard and just kept swimming forward.
Silence.
Nick just kept rapidly swimming forward in silence.
After a bit, Nick opened his eyes.
He saw the light of the "street" of the Dregs in front of him.
He was almost there.
Nick continued swimming.
And then…
He entered the street.
Nick was now in the light of the streets of the Dregs.
Nothing had happened in the darkness.
Nick turned around to look at the block of houses behind him with suspicion.
Had the Nightmare given up?
He doubted it.
Yet, Nick was back in the light again.
The Nightmare had no influence over Nick here.
BANG!
Suddenly, something hit Nick's head!
Splash! Splash! Splash! Splash!
Nick quickly shook his head and looked around him.
Rats!
"Don't wanna give me bodies, huh?" one of the rats spoke.
"How about you give me your body then!"
And then, the rats all charged at Nick.



Chapter 21 Target
As soon as the rats fell on him and attacked him, Nick gritted his teeth in fury.
They had an unspoken agreement!
"You'll regret this!" Nick shouted.
This was different from the Nightmare.
The Parasite only had a limited number of rats, and Nick could cause real damage to the Parasite by killing them.
However, the rats could also cause real damage to Nick. After all, they were real.
Five rats immediately jumped on Nick.
Nick's right hand grabbed one of them and squeezed.
CRKSH!
The rat was squeezed into a thin sock of wet meat.
At the same time, Nick's left hand turned into a fist and punched a second rat.
BOOM!
The rat shot into the distance and hit the water over 50 meters away from Nick, skipping twice on the surface.
However, the other three rats reached Nick and immediately bit into his body.
One of them bit his right biceps, and the other two bit his chest.
At the same time, Nick saw several more rats coming out from the water around him.
Nick gritted his teeth in pain and hatred.
Nick grabbed one of the rats and pulled.
CRKSH!
The rat's body was torn off, but the head remained stuck in Nick's biceps.
BANG!
Another rat was turned into paste by another one of Nick's punches.
The last one let go and dove into the water while the other rats came closer.
Just a second later, three more rats were jumping at Nick.
Nick released several more attacks, but the rats just kept going after him without pause.
Even more, the rats even started to attack him from below the surface.
Nick's rage grew as he kept tearing the rats into pieces.
It was never-ending!
Some seconds later, Nick had already killed over 15 rats.
Yet, they just kept on coming!
The Parasite really went all in!
'I would already be dead without my ability!'
And then, Nick's eyes widened.
'My ability?'
Nick stopped resisting the rats.
'My ability shouldn't be working right now.'
'Yet, I am tearing these rats apart like they are paper.'
'My ability is still active!'
'This can only mean one thing.'
The realization had positive and negative aspects to it.
On one hand, Nick wasn't being attacked by the real Parasite, which meant that he had not actually been injured.
But on the other hand, Nick had spun around so many times during the battle that he didn't even know which direction he was facing.
In the end, Nick could only grit his teeth as he took one of the tubes from his thigh and broke it.
CRKSH!
All the rats vanished as Nick was swallowed by light.
Just now, Nick had been in the "street" of the sewers, but as soon as the light appeared around him, Nick saw that he was still about two meters away from the real street.
Nick had still been in the darkness.
'The Nightmare had made it seem like I had already reached the end when I actually hadn't.'
Nick immediately swam over to the street, which wasn't difficult with only two meters between him and it.
Now, Nick was actually back in the street of light.
'The Nightmare can even create illusions of light,' Nick thought with anxiety and fear.
'This is not something I can compete with.'
Nick looked back at the dark domain he had just left behind.
'At least I'm out now.'
The next moment, he looked around the sewers.
There were over a hundred similarly big domains.
Nick had gone through hell and had used two Arclights after going just through one of them.
'This is beyond my level.'
Silence.
Nick had been down here for several hours now, and he had become quite familiar with the sewers.
But in the end, he had to leave without any gains.
Even worse, Nick had even used two Arclights.
'Guess I'm going to become an Inspector now.'
'It's probably not a bad job.'
'I get to leave the Dregs, and I can probably also get a normal home.'
'Maybe I can even build a family.'
Yet, no matter how enticing the position as an Inspector seemed to Nick, he still felt regret.
For a while, Nick just looked at the ceiling of the sewers.
This would be his last excursion as a Zephyx Extractor.
Wyntor had already used up all the money he had access to.
He had bet everything on Nick.
Sadly, Nick would only disappoint him.
Silence.
Nick just watched the ceiling in silence.
A bird flew past him.
Suddenly, Nick's eyes widened.
A bird?
Nick's eyes immediately locked onto the bird as it entered a black domain representing a block of houses.
Just now, Nick had been set on giving up.
But now, he was hesitating again.
'A bird!'
'That must have been the Dreamer!'
Nick's heart rate rose rapidly as adrenaline shot through his body.
'After hours, its old target must have woken up or died, and it had to go to a new one!'
Nick's eyes locked onto the black domain where the Dreamer had to be in right now.
There were no toilets in this block, and the block was about fifty by fifty meters.
In the center of the block was the ruin of a stony tower, which supported the block of houses above it in the middle.
As Nick looked at the domain, images of what had happened to him earlier reappeared in his mind.
Pain, deceit, horror, death.
Nick was finally free!
He could finally leave the sewers!
He no longer needed to go through the darkness again!
But the Dreamer was right there!
Just once more!
Just one more time!
But what if he didn't succeed?
He might be risking his life for nothing.
After all, the Dreamer was obviously at the ceiling of the sewers.
Nick would need to swim for about twenty meters in pure darkness, climb ten meters of the structure, and then catch the Dreamer.
And he had to do that all in pure silence so that the Dreamer wouldn't notice him and in the Nightmare's illusionary hell.
He couldn't even use the last Arclight since that would immediately draw the Dreamer's focus to Nick, which would deactivate his ability.
At that point, Nick wouldn't be any stronger than a normal human.
In such a state, the Dreamer could probably just kill Nick without relying on the Nightmare or the environment.
If the Dreamer noticed him, he would die.
No matter how Nick thought about it…
It was impossible.



Chapter 22 The Climb
It was impossible.
No matter how long he thought about it.
It was just impossible.
Yet, Nick just couldn't stop getting excited.
He wanted to do it.
He wanted to try it!
…
But he would likely die…
Nick clenched his fists.
'I know it's a shit idea.'
'I know I will most likely die.'
'But I have to give it a go!'
'I just have to give it a shot!'
'Otherwise, I will never become happy!'
Nick took a deep breath.
Then, Nick silently swam over to the black domain.
Nick tried his best to move as silently as possible as he moved in a circle around the domain.
He poked his head into the darkness and looked at the ceiling from different angles.
Since Nick now knew what the Dreamer looked like, he could search a larger area of the ceiling.
However, even after searching for over 15 minutes near the edge, Nick still couldn't find the Dreamer.
'This means it has to be at the center.'
'It's probably even sitting on a part of the broken tower.'
The tower in the middle had several holes in it and a very uneven surface. Half of it had collapsed, while the other half supported the block of houses above it.
The Dreamer had to either be in one of the higher windows or on top of one of the two walls leading up to the ceiling.
Nick took a deep breath and looked for a good way upward.
'I have to move silently. This means I can't just jump from wall to wall.'
'I have to climb constantly and consistently.'
After a bit of looking around, Nick found a fitting spot.
'I can only climb the small windows at the tall front of the ruin. I think the tower is just one big spiral staircase in the middle, but I doubt that the spiral staircase is still intact.'
'I could attempt to walk up the staircase, but the Nightmare's illusions won't allow me to actually see where I'm going, and if I'm not careful, I might actually fall through a broken or missing step.'
'That would alert the Dreamer to my location.'
Nick just looked at the broken tower.
It was so enticing.
He could just use the stairs.
Nick sighed.
Nick couldn't trust his eyes in the darkness, and since he couldn't inspect the staircase from here, he couldn't risk climbing it.
He had to navigate blindly, and he preferred taking the difficult route he could see instead of the potentially easy route that he couldn't see.
'Luckily, there are quite a lot of windows.'
'Right to left for about three windows. Jump to the top right to grab the lowest one of the next floor of stairs and climb another three.'
'After that, two more windows will be above me and one more window above those.'
'There's a small chance that the Dreamer is in the two lower ones but a relatively high one that it's in the highest one.'
Nick went over this plan a couple more times.
And finally, he was done.
The plan was set.
Nick slowly swam to his starting position, which was facing the highest part of the ruined tower.
Silence.
Nick couldn't see the Dreamer right now, but he knew that it was there.
He knew that the likelihood of death was very high, but he had to do it.
Nick took a deep breath as he closed his eyes.
Silence.
Seconds passed.
Nick's eyes shot open, and he swam forward.
As soon as Nick entered the darkness, he closed his eyes again.
Then, he suddenly submerged!
Swimming on the surface was way too loud, which was why Nick decided to move forward while being about a meter below the surface.
Almost immediately, Nick felt several small fish glide across his body.
It was like Nick had been submerged in a thick vat of small fish.
The bodies of the fish disoriented Nick's senses, and he couldn't even feel the liquid around him anymore.
Was he swimming forward or downward?
He had already lost all sense of direction.
'The only thing I can rely on is my muscle memory!'
'As long as I order my body to continue swimming forward, no matter what, I will reach the tower!'
However, just two seconds later, Nick felt things around him change.
The mouths of the fish opened, and they started to tear into his body.
Right now, Nick was surrounded by a pile of swimming maws with terrifying teeth.
They were tearing at Nick's muscles, bones, and tendons.
The pain was horrible.
Nick's body kept shaking, but he just kept moving forward.
'This isn't real! This isn't real! This isn't real!'
'The pain isn't real!'
'It isn't real!'
Nevertheless, Nick felt like a dark void of hopelessness had opened in his chest.
'Just continue!'
Nick's flesh and blood were scattering across his surroundings.
He was dying!
But he continued!
He had to continue!
BANG!
Suddenly, Nick hit something solid!
'Did I reach it?!'
But then, Nick found an issue.
Was this actually the end?
Or was this another illusion by the Nightmare?
At this moment, Nick's emotions were going crazy.
Was he?
Wasn't he?!
In a state of panic, Nick did the first thing that came to his mind.
BANG!
Nick rammed his face against the wall!
Nick immediately felt his eyes water as his nose broke in several places.
'This feels real!'
The Nightmare's illusions were terrifyingly accurate, but when Nick compared the Nightmare's sense of pain with actual pain, there was something different.
Yes, the pain the Nightmare created was real, but there were some accompanying sensations missing.
For example, Nick had felt his entire head and mind vibrate when he had headbutted the wall.
Additionally, Nick had felt like he was about to lose consciousness for just a moment.
While the pain was the same, these sensations didn't exist when the Nightmare created an illusion.
'Luckily, the ruin is massive. The Dreamer shouldn't have felt that vibration.'
The next moment, Nick surfaced and grabbed the wall in front of him with his hands.
'I have to find the first window!'
In Nick's mind, he was rubbing against a huge wall as he desperately tried to find an invisible hole in it.
'Where is it?!'
'There!'
Nick felt something and pulled himself up with one arm.
'This proves that my ability is still active, which means the Dreamer hasn't noticed me yet!'
CRKSH!
The hole Nick had put his hand into suddenly sprouted teeth and was grinding it into a meaty paste.
Nick's eyes became bloodshot beneath his eyelids as he tried to ignore the pain.
After pulling himself up, Nick moved his hand to the left and jumped.
He knew where the window should be, but he didn't know where it was exactly.
CRK!
Nick's hand entered a hole, but his fingers hit the other side of the window, splitting the nails of two of his fingers.
Nick just gritted his teeth as he grabbed the window with his hand.
The fact that he could stop his jump with one hand meant that the Dreamer still hadn't noticed him!
The next moment, the wall seemed to split open, and Nick felt like he was falling through it.
'It's not real!'
Nick moved his bleeding fingertips to the left side and felt the scratching feeling traveling over his body.
He was still in the window!
Even though Nick felt like he was falling into a never-ending abyss of pain, he jumped once more to the left.
CRK!
One of Nick's nails exploded off his body as it hit the wall of the window again.
But when Nick felt that he could still pull himself upward with one arm, he became more excited.
'I'm doing it!'
Nick hadn't opened his eyes yet.
He had done all of this blind.
'Now, for the most difficult jump!'
After amending his plan a bit, Nick decided to jump to the second window in the second row.
The jump was a bit higher vertically but not as long horizontally.
Nick's knees bent down, and he gathered all his power.
The next moment, Nick jumped upward.
In Nick's illusory reality, he felt like he was jumping upward hundreds of meters.
It was impossible to tell how high he had actually jumped.
Nick felt the wall in front of him rapidly move as he desperately tried to find the window.
Fear and terror reached new heights.
CRACK!
When Nick felt the tips of the fingers of his left arm getting crushed, he felt elated.
The window!
Nick fell a bit, but he managed to grab the bottom of the window with both of his hands.
By now, Nick's left hand had become severely injured, with a couple of broken bones and destroyed nails.
He pulled himself into the window easily, which meant the Dreamer hadn't noticed him yet.
He was so close!
Nick quickly jumped to the left again as razors appeared on the wall in front of him, cutting his chest into pieces.
CRACK!
Nick felt the impact of his broken bones rubbing against each other and grabbed the window.
After pulling himself into the window, Nick's excitement reached new heights.
He was so close!
He could do it!
Instead of jumping towards the next window, Nick grabbed the last tube of Arclight.
The next moment, Nick opened his eyes.
A red hellscape of flesh and blades encompassed his reality.
Everything was being consumed by the Nightmare.
However, Nick's eyes only looked forward with determination.
Then, he threw the tube of Arclight upwards with all of his power.
BANG!
The tube broke, and the Arclight exploded at the ceiling of the dark domain.
For an instant, all the darkness vanished as a shining star seemingly appeared in the dark sky.
The hellscape vanished, and Nick found himself in the third window of the second row.
However, Nick's eyes immediately moved across the ruins above him.
'There!'
In the highest window, Nick saw a black owl with black eyes.
It was quite big, over half a meter tall.
At this moment, the owl was looking at the Arclight shining on the ceiling.
This was why Nick had thrown the Arclight instead of breaking it directly.
The Dreamer's attention would remain fully on the Arclight, and Nick would get a bit of time to reach the Dreamer with his ability.
As long as he managed to grab it without it noticing him, he could break several of its bones, turning it almost helpless!
When Nick saw his target, his eyes narrowed, and he immediately jumped upward with all of his power.
Nick easily and quickly grabbed the window directly above him, but instead of pulling himself into the window, Nick continued.
The Dreamer was now paying attention to its surroundings, and pulling into the window would take too long.
Because of that, Nick immediately pulled himself upward and threw himself at the Dreamer.
The Dreamer was still looking at the Arclight.
Nick was only a meter away from the Dreamer!
But then, he noticed that his jump hadn't been strong enough, and he found himself dropping.
Nick gritted his teeth and rammed his feet into the broken stone of the tower.
Some of his toes broke, but Nick managed to create a hole in the wall, making a foothold.
Naturally, that was extremely loud, and the Dreamer's head turned towards Nick.
But Nick had already jumped again.
Nick was flying at the Dreamer.
The Dreamer was turning to Nick.
Nick's hand came closer.
And then…
Their eyes met.
Nick managed to grab the wing of the Dreamer.
He pulled with all of his strength.
The Dreamer pulled its wing upward.
CRKSH!
Nick tore out a couple of feathers.
His ability no longer worked.
He didn't have enough strength to break the wing.
Nick's expression turned into shock and horror as he felt himself fall.
The Dreamer's black eyes looked into Nick's eyes.
'No!'



Chapter 23 Run
'No!'
'I was so close!'
Nick's ability no longer worked, which meant he was only a bit stronger than an average human right now.
At this moment, Nick was falling from about eight meters of height into a pool of toxic waste with several sharp pieces of metal.
While Nick's ability was working, this wasn't an issue.
But now…
Nick's thoughts stopped.
Time seemed to freeze.
And then, time resumed as the Dreamer got further and further away from Nick.
SPLASH!
Nick hit the liquid shoulder first.
CRKSH! CRKSH!
Several pieces of metal created cuts in Nick's skin, and he started to bleed.
On top of that, Nick's destroyed fingers also came into contact with the toxic liquid.
In an instant, Nick felt like his body was being drowned in acid.
The force of the fall also made it difficult for Nick to move, but his adrenaline pushed him to immediately go to the surface.
As soon as Nick broke the surface again, he took a deep breath.
But then, Nick saw the owl just a meter in front of him, its claws stretched towards Nick.
The Dreamer was attacking, and without his ability, Nick was helpless!
BANG!
Nick immediately pulled his head down into the water, and the next moment, two long claws tore through the water above him.
The Dreamer was not going to flee.
No, it was going to kill Nick!
Nick immediately dove further and further down, several pieces of metal scraping his skin.
But then, Nick suddenly accelerated, and he stopped getting injured.
Nick had reached a depth where the light couldn't reach him, which meant that the Dreamer couldn't see him anymore.
Nick's ability activated again.
'I have to flee!' Nick thought. 'As long as it pays attention to me, I can't fight it!'
After coming to a decision, he immediately shot towards the direction of the sewer's exit.
But then, a huge black eye opened in front of Nick, and he became paralyzed.
Nick's thoughts stopped as he looked at the terrifying black eye.
The next moment, a maw filled with teeth opened in front of him and swallowed him.
Nick felt his body getting torn apart, but then he realized that this wasn't real.
Since he was now in a place with no light, the Nightmare's influence had returned.
'The Dreamer above.'
'The Nightmare below.'
'I can't move like this! The Nightmare could lead me in any random direction!'
'I have to surface to assess the direction I'm facing!'
Nick gnashed his teeth and shot upward.
The eyes and maws around him slowly vanished.
The Arclight was still active, and it illuminated the surroundings.
Shortly before Nick broke the surface, he suddenly felt the acid of the liquid become stronger.
This meant the Dreamer was seeing him.
Nick broke past the surface and took a breath as he quickly looked around.
'There!'
Nick found the way he had to go towards and immediately dove into the water again.
CRRRSH!
Nick clenched his teeth even more as he felt a big gash opening up on his back.
Just now, the Dreamer had created three huge gashes as it tore Nick's skin and a bit of muscle apart.
This was a Specter, not a random bird!
If it got hold of Nick, it could probably stab one of its claws through his entire torso!
A normal human couldn't possibly fight something like this.
As Nick descended, the intensity of the acid subsided.
He closed his eyes and immediately started to swim forward.
A moment later, the heat of the water rose sharply, and it felt like Nick was swimming through a boiling pot of oil!
Nick's entire body turned red, and he wanted to do nothing but scream in pain.
He was burning!
He was dying!
'It's not real!'
'It's not real!'
'It's not real!'
BANG!
Suddenly, Nick's right hand hit something solid, and Nick's head quickly followed.
'A house?! Now?!'
Nick had hit one of the ruins.
He had to quickly make a decision.
Immediately, he shot up.
The house wasn't that tall, and there was still about a meter between its ceiling and the surface.
At this moment, Nick felt a bit of light, but his ability hadn't deactivated yet.
This meant that the Dreamer hadn't seen him.
Nick swam forward in silence, his chest almost sliding against the house's roof.
Suddenly, the water started to severely burn him again, and Nick's body shook.
His ability had deactivated!
At that moment, a plan formed in Nick's mind, and he slowly spun onto his back.
Nick was betting on the fact that the Dreamer could see him but not perfectly see him.
Right now, since Nick was still about a meter below the surface, the Dreamer could probably only see a vague silhouette or shadow.
Meanwhile, the Dreamer was illuminated by the light behind it, allowing Nick to perfectly see it.
At this moment, the Dreamer was diving towards him with its outstretched claws.
Nick's anxiety reached new heights.
The Dreamer reached him.
BANG!
Nick shoved himself to the side as the Dreamer's claws reached into the water.
Due to Nick's depth, the Dreamer also had to fully enter the liquid, slowing it down significantly.
The Dreamer's claws barely passed by Nick, and Nick immediately grabbed them with his two hands.
The Dreamer's wings flapped to get out of the liquid again, and Nick felt himself getting pulled up.
Splash!
The two of them left the liquid behind, the Dreamer pulling Nick into the sky.
Right now, the Dreamer didn't have the luxury to look at Nick, but Nick's ability still didn't reactivate.
Hearing and feeling someone also counted as perceiving someone.
After gaining a couple of meters, the Dreamer looked at Nick, and its beak opened.
But by now, Nick had repositioned himself.
He had pulled himself upward and had angled his body.
And then…
BANG!
Nick kicked the Dreamer's head!
While the Dreamer was much more powerful than Nick without his ability, a kick to the head still hurt quite a lot.
At the same time, Nick let go of the Dreamer's claws and threw himself towards the exit of the sewers.
His kick and the force of the jump completely disoriented the Dreamer, and it fell into the water a couple of meters away.
However, it wasn't significantly injured, and Nick was sure that it would return to flying above him in a matter of seconds.
'Only about 200 meters or so left to the exit! I refuse to believe that it will follow me to the surface!'
Nick immediately swam forward, and since the Dreamer was still in the water, his ability had reactivated, and he swam with all of his power.
Splash!
Some seconds later, Nick heard the loud sound of something leaving the water about 30 meters behind him.
Five seconds after the sound, Nick's ability deactivated again.
Nick gritted his teeth and dove into the water.
More scratches appeared across his body.
BANG!
But the Dreamer's attack missed, and Nick's ability reactivated.
Sadly, just moments later, an army of maws tore at Nick's body again, and Nick felt like he was swimming downward instead of forward.
Yet, Nick just kept swimming.
He ignored the pain.
He ignored the horrors.
BANG!
Then, Nick hit something solid again.
'This is that one house I investigated!'
'I'm just about 50 meters away from the exit!'
By now, Nick's lungs were screaming at him to surface.
'I have to run across it!'
Nick surfaced again.
However, his ability deactivated before he even breached the surface!
The Dreamer wasn't stupid.
It had seen where Nick had swam towards, and it was constantly looking in that direction.
Nevertheless, Nick rapidly moved forward as he did his best to run in waist-high water.
He turned back to look at where the Dreamer was.
The next moment, he saw the Dreamer dive towards him.
Nick couldn't evade!
There were still several meters left!
The Dreamer would get him!



Chapter 24 Struggle
Nick readied himself.
He had to do something!
At that moment, Nick's back began to burn, or at least, it felt like it.
Light appeared around Nick.
And then, something shocking happened.
The Dreamer's eyes burst into flames!
"SCREEEEE!"
The Dreamer screeched, and it did its best to stop its dive.
Nick had no idea what was happening.
"Nick!" someone shouted between coughs.
Nick looked back.
Wyntor!
Wyntor was standing just behind him, his expensive suit drenched in sewer water!
At this moment, a bright fire was burning around Wyntor, and his eyes had turned completely white.
"Get it!" Wyntor shouted before heaving and looking away from Nick.
Immediately, Nick felt his ability become active again.
When the Dreamer's eyes had caught fire, its sight had been robbed from it, which meant that it couldn't perceive Nick anymore!
Nick immediately turned towards the Dreamer, which was about to pass about two meters above him.
Rage appeared in Nick's eyes.
BANG!
Nick jumped with all of his power, the water around him exploding.
And then, he punched.
CRACK!
Nick's fist hit the center of the Dreamer's chest, and Nick swore he felt something break!
And this time, it was not one of his bones!
The Dreamer's body spun in the air, and its flapping became very disorderly.
Nick landed first, and he immediately rushed toward the place where the Dreamer would land.
Splash!
The Dreamer hit the water, and Nick jumped on it.
BANG!
Nick kicked one of the Dreamer's wings, easily breaking it.
The next moment, Nick grabbed the Dreamer's thick neck with both of his arms and squeezed.
Nick's ability deactivated again, but that didn't matter.
Squeezing someone's neck didn't need a huge difference in power.
Right now, Nick and the Dreamer were tumbling in the horrible liquid of the sewers as he tried to strangle it.
Yet, some seconds later, the Dreamer's head spun by 180°.
'Right, it's a fucking owl!' Nick thought in horror.
The Dreamer's beak opened as it tried to tear Nick's neck apart.
Nick quickly let go of the Dreamer's neck.
His left arm pushed the Dreamer away from his neck as his right arm shot towards its head.
The next moment, the Dreamer just saw two fingers become bigger and bigger in its vision.
CRKSH!
The Dreamer screeched as Nick's fingers crushed its eyes.
The Dreamer's screech was cut off as the liquid from the sewers entered its throat.
Nick gnashed his teeth in rage as his two fingers dug deep into the Dreamer's eye sockets.
Nick's thumb grabbed the bottom of the Dreamer's beak, and he grabbed it with all of his power.
The next moment, Nick wrestled with the Dreamer awkwardly until he eventually managed to get behind its back with his fingers still in its eye sockets.
Splash!
A splash appeared beside Nick, and Wyntor appeared beside Nick.
"Keep it like this!" Wyntor shouted.
By now, Nick's legs had also grabbed the Dreamer's body, and he was doing his best not to drown in the sewers.
The Dreamer was still flailing around in panic, and Nick had to do everything in his power to keep it suppressed.
The next moment, Wyntor took out some kind of flexible metallic cable and wrapped it around the Dreamer's neck.
The cable quickly started to shine red, and the Dreamer's struggles intensified.
However, Nick kept it stable.
After around ten seconds, the Dreamer's struggles became weaker, and half a minute later, it completely stopped moving.
"Can I let go?" Nick asked.
"You, huuurgh, can," Wyntor said with a heave.
Nick slowly took his hand out of the Dreamer's eye sockets but still kept hold of the Dreamer.
"Put it in the sack on the shore," Wyntor said quickly before he had to heave again.
Nick nodded and pulled the Dreamer towards the exit.
About a minute later, Nick reached the exit of the sewers, and he pulled the Dreamer onto the land.
Now, Nick could actually take a good look at the Dreamer.
Its chest was caved in.
Both of its wings were broken, the second one having gotten broken in the scuffle.
Black blood was flowing out of its empty eyes.
One of its legs was bent at an unnatural angle.
Many feathers were missing.
Luckily, this was a Specter.
These wounds were not enough to kill a Specter, and it would recover within a week at most.
Nick took a deep breath.
And then, pain assaulted him.
Two of Nick's fingernails were missing on his left hand.
Three of Nick's fingers were broken.
Nick had several cuts on his body.
He had three huge gashes going across his back.
Nick even felt some intense pain coming from his ribs.
He guessed they had gotten bruised or broken during the scuffle in the water.
And to top it all off, his nose was also broken.
Nick was in a world of pain, and he also knew that the wounds were bound to get horribly infected since they had all been washed quite thoroughly in the disgusting liquid of the sewers.
He only hoped that Wyntor had some way to help him recover.
Nick knew if he had to rely on the medicine available in the Dregs, he would die.
His ability gave him some resistance to infections and poisons, but he wasn't sure if that was enough in this case.
"Huuuuurgh!"
Nick heard Wyntor heave as he came out of the sewers.
Nick turned to Wyntor and looked at him.
Right now, Wyntor was on his knees and hands as he coughed and heaved like he was about to die.
'He wasn't able to follow me into the sewers earlier, but when he saw me in danger, he actually jumped in.'
Nick's trust in Wyntor reached new heights.
Wyntor, the fancy heir of the Melfion family, a guy that constantly wiped his hands whenever he touched anything even slightly dirty, had jumped into the sewers to save him.
'Maybe he isn't as stuck up as I had initially thought.'
'When it comes down to it, he is actually trustworthy.'
Nick took a deep breath.
Right now, he felt elated.
The risk had paid off!
He had done it!
"Wyntor," Nick said.
Nick only heard another heave.
"We did it!"



Chapter 25 Walking Back
It took Wyntor a while to recover, but eventually, he managed to stop puking his heart out.
While Wyntor had been puking, Nick had shoved the Dreamer into the sack they had brought with them.
The sack was just a normal sack.
When Wyntor stood up and saw the sack, all his unhappiness and disgust seemed to vanish.
A Specter!
They had a Specter in their grasp!
They actually had one!
Then, Wyntor saw Nick, and he had to take a deep breath.
Nick looked really worn out.
Blood was flowing from several parts of his body, and Wyntor already knew that all these wounds would get infected very soon.
"Are you okay?" Wyntor asked.
"Do I look like I'm okay?" Nick asked.
Wyntor winced, but Nick just laughed.
"Relax, I'm okay. I'm just joking," Nick said.
Wyntor sighed. "You look really messed up, you know."
"I know," Nick answered. "So, got anything that I can use to deal with these wounds? I kind of don't want to die, you know?"
Wyntor just nodded. "We can visit a hospital in the Outer City. Since we now have a Specter, the money is going to flow in soon. Additionally, I need you to be at your best."
"After all, you are the Chief Extractor, which means that you not only have to work with the Dreamer but also find out how to work with it."
"Every Specter is unique, and every Specter needs to be treated differently to get the most Zephyx out of them."
Nick just nodded before he grabbed the sack with the Dreamer.
A moment later, Nick noticed how light the sack actually was with surprise.
"Huh, that's lighter than expected," Nick said.
"Specters have a lot of power, but they are using Zephyx converted from Prephyx as their main source of power," Wyntor explained. "Specters are actually pretty light. They are not made of a lot of Zephyx, but the Zephyx is so potent that they still manage to unleash incredible powers."
"That tall bird probably barely weighs five kilos."
Nick nodded.
The next moment, he slung the sack over his shoulders.
The cable that Wyntor had put around the Dreamer was something that Nick had already heard about.
It was a Zephyx Blocker, something that was used to stop the flow of Zephyx.
At this moment, the Zephyx Blocker was using up its stored energy to stop the Dreamer's Zephyx from flowing.
Since this was the lowest grade, it would only work for about five hours when put on a level one Specter.
This meant that Wyntor and Nick had to deliver the Dreamer to their headquarters within the next five hours, but that was plenty of time.
Wyntor and Nick walked out of the entrance to the sewers and emerged in an abandoned part of the Dregs.
Wyntor immediately took a deep breath of the Dregs.
He had never imagined that he would one day find the air in the Dregs to be refreshing and enjoyable.
As the two of them walked through the Dregs, they saw all the people look at them with disgust while avoiding them.
These two smelled absolutely abhorrent, even by the Dregs' standards.
However, the two of them didn't pay a lot of attention to the onlookers.
They were far too excited about finally having caught their first Specter.
After about half an hour, they finally left the densest part of the Dregs behind, and they entered the outskirts.
The streets transitioned from being made of rusty metal into being made of polished metal, and the houses also started to become more uniform and orderly.
Naturally, the people on the streets also seemed more well-dressed, and their reactions to the two of them were even more disgusted.
"Stop!"
The two stopped as their brows furrowed.
The next moment, two people wearing black combat uniforms walked up to them. The two men looked with disgust at them while they were holding their noses.
"People like you are not welcome here! Leave the Outer City, or we'll make you!" one of them shouted.
Naturally, the two of them were city guards, and it was part of their duty to keep the Outer City clean from unsavory people.
Two people stinking of piss and shit could be seen as unsavory.
Wyntor put his hand in this pocket.
One of the two guards narrowed his eyes and shot forward, grabbing Wyntor's arm before he could get it back out of his pocket.
The guard thought that Wyntor was about to pull a weapon on them.
"Stop resisting!" the guard shouted as he pulled Wyntor's arm violently out of his pocket.
CRK!
The next moment, Wyntor's wrist seemed to give, and it extended a bit further than it should.
His wrist had been dislocated by the guard.
While Wyntor had an ability from a Specter, he was not an athletic person, while the guards were very athletic and strong.
Wyntor gritted his teeth as the guard pulled his arm to the side to lock it behind his back.
The next moment, the guard wrestled Wyntor to the ground.
While all of this was happening, Nick locked eyes with the other guard.
Then, Nick looked down for a small moment before looking at the guard again.
Naturally, the guard realized that Nick had essentially told him to look down.
The guard glanced down, and he saw a small card, which had just fallen out of Wyntor's hand.
The guard furrowed his brows as he looked at Nick, who only stared back without saying anything.
In the end, the second guard kneeled down to retrieve the card.
After looking at the card, the guard's face turned white in horror as he looked at Wyntor, who was held on the ground by the other guard.
The second guard immediately jumped over to the first guard and pulled him off. "James, stop!"
The first guard shoved the second guard away with annoyance. "What's your problem?!" he shouted.
The second guard shoved the card into the first guard's hands with urgency.
The second guard looked at the card with annoyance.
But then, his eyes widened, and he turned to look at the person below him with terror.
At this moment, Wyntor glared at the guard with venom.
The guard froze.
In his hand, the guard currently held a Residency Card for the highest floor of the Inner City, and the name on the card was Wyntor Melfion.
Naturally, the guards knew exactly who they were currently looking at.



Chapter 26 Contained
"Wait here," Wyntor ordered with a curt and annoyed voice as he and Nick entered their warehouse.
The two guards waited in front of the building like two children who had just been yelled at, which wasn't inaccurate.
Naturally, after they had realized that they had just shoved one of the heirs of the Melfion family to the ground, they had immediately apologized profusely.
Wyntor had just acted very calmly but coldly and told them that they were going to be following them for a bit.
The two guards didn't protest.
As the door of the warehouse closed in front of them, the anxiety of the two guards exploded.
If Wyntor decided to get his family's lawyers involved, they could very well lose their jobs, if not worse!
Meanwhile, Nick and Wyntor walked over to the only Containment Unit they owned.
Nick waited in front of the entrance while Wyntor operated a console with many buttons to the side of the Containment Unit.
A moment later, a loud alarm came from the Containment Unit as red lights lit up everywhere.
The two of them weren't surprised.
This was the alarm of a Containment Unit being fully opened.
The cheapest Containment Units only had three ways to open them.
First, opening a tiny door to put handheld objects into it.
Second, opening a door for a human to get through.
Third, opening the big gate to put a Specter in.
But wait, the Dreamer was quite small.
Why couldn't Nick just carry it through the normal door?
Well, a Containment Unit was more than just a big cube of steel.
There were also several sensors, alarms, barriers, and defenses on it.
When a human passed through the door, the Containment Unit wouldn't care, but if a Specter tried to pass through it, all the defenses would activate.
Otherwise, small and sneaky Specters would be able to sneak out of the Containment Unit when people walked in and out of it.
So, when a Specter was put into a Containment Unit, one had to open the main gate, which also deactivated all of the defenses.
Naturally, more expensive Containment Units had more ways to open them, but this was just the cheapest variant.
After the big gate fully opened, Nick walked into the Containment Unit.
The gate slowly closed behind him again.
When it was fully closed, the artificial light appeared in the Containment Unit.
Normal artificial light didn't help against the Nightmare's influence, but Containment Units could use Zephyx to illuminate the inside.
More expensive Containment Units had special tunnels made of reflective glass, which would safely deliver sunlight into the Containment Unit, cutting down on the cost of lighting.
Sadly, their shitty Containment Unit didn't have such luxury.
They had to make do with using Zephyx to light the inside.
Luckily, they only needed to light the inside when a human was in there since Specters didn't need light.
When the light turned on, Nick dumped the Dreamer into the middle of the Containment Unit.
Due to the Zephyx Blocker, the Dreamer didn't move.
Nick looked at the motionless Dreamer for a couple of seconds until the normal door of the Containment Unit opened behind him.
Nick bent forward and grabbed the Zephyx Blocker.
After untangling it, Nick ran out of the Containment Unit, and Wyntor immediately closed the door.
Silence.
They had done it.
The Dreamer was inside of the Containment Unit!
Wyntor looked at the console beside the Containment Unit and checked its operating status.
A couple of minutes later, Wyntor nodded with a sigh of relief.
"Everything is operating normally."
"The Dreamer has been detected, and the defenses are ready to engage if it tries anything," Wyntor said. "We don't have to worry about it escaping."
Nick nodded while releasing a sigh of relief.
Finally, they had the Dreamer securely contained.
"Now," Wyntor said as his voice turned darker while turning to the exit of the warehouse. "Let's deal with those two."
"What do you have in mind?" Nick asked.
"An exchange," Wyntor said. "The guards are afraid of my background, and they are going to do anything to get my lawyers off their backs."
"Come," Wyntor said as he walked to the exit.
Nick just followed him.
The two of them found the two guards quickly, and Wyntor told them to follow him.
The guards just followed Wyntor while trying to apologize some more.
Eventually, the four of them reached a tall building with the symbol of a green carriage on it.
This was one of the biggest hospital chains in the world, and they operated in many cities.
The company owning these hospitals was a Zephyx Manufacturer primarily, but they had one of the few contained level six Specters.
The Contained Specter was a carriage that was called the Merchant.
When one threw corpses into the carriage, healing potions came out of the carriage, and a bit of Zephyx would be given off by the carriage.
Naturally, the company made use of the healing medicine and created hospitals everywhere.
For profit, of course.
"One recovery bath and I will forget what happened. After all, I need one," Wyntor said as he shook his dislocated wrist a bit.
The two guards took deep breaths and looked at each other in horror.
"Sir Melfion, I'm not sure-"
"It's either you or your district that will pay for my treatment," Wyntor said, interrupting the guard. "Which one is it?"
The two guards retreated a bit and talked with each other in whispers.
They seemed to argue intensely.
It took nearly three minutes for them to return.
"We'll pay," one of them said with a sigh.
Wyntor nodded, and the four of them walked into the hospital.
When they walked to the receptionist, the receptionist tried her best to remain somewhat professional under the immense stench that assaulted her.
If she hadn't seen the two guards behind the two dirty visitors, she would have already called security to throw them out.
"Yes, how can I help you?" she asked with a forced smile.
"One full-body recovery bath and one cleansing bath. The two baths are paid separately," Wyntor said.
"Of course," the receptionist said, her professionalism now genuine.
After all, these were actual customers, apparently.
"That is 150 credits for the cleansing bath," she said.
The next moment, Wyntor took out a couple of notes and put them on the table.
The receptionist collected them with a polite smile and gave Wyntor a small orange token.
"And that will be 4,800 credits for the full-body recovery bath," she said.
Wyntor gestured to the guards.
One of the guards walked over and handed the receptionist a card.
The receptionist thanked him and put the card onto a plate of steel.
Then, she grabbed a small piece of something that looked like clay and wrote the number 4,800 on it.
The next moment, she put a small signature below the number, and she handed the piece of clay to the guard.
The guard released a shaky breath and signed it.
"Thank you," the receptionist said as she put the card on top of the piece of clay and put everything into a metal box.
A green light came out of the box.
A moment later, the receptionist took the card out and handed it to the guard.
At the same time, she took out the piece of clay, which had now been hardened, and put it under her table.
Sadly, there was no easy way to communicate with the bank directly.
Every week, the business would deliver the small pieces of clay to the banks and get the money.
The receptionist handed Wyntor a green ticket with several complicated black lines.
Wyntor looked at the two guards.
"We're done. You can leave."
"Thank you, sir," one of the guards said.
Then, the two guards left the hospital.
The next moment, Wyntor held out his ticket for the full-body recovery path to Nick.
"Have fun."



Chapter 27 A Bath
Nick looked with surprise at Wyntor.
He had thought that Wyntor would maybe give his ticket to him, but when it actually happened, Nick was still surprised.
Nick felt bad accepting something so expensive.
"You just earned us a ton of money," Wyntor said, not looking at Nick. "Just take it."
Nick hesitated, but in the end, he just accepted it.
After all, he also didn't really want to die from his injuries, and despite his current demeanor, he was in quite a lot of pain.
When Nick took the ticket, Wyntor nodded. "Just follow the signs. I'll wait for you in three hours. That's usually how long these baths take. I've had my fair share of them in the past."
'He had his fair share of them?' Nick thought.
Nick doubted that Wyntor had taken a three-hour bath for every minor injury he had ever received, which meant that Wyntor had probably been heavily injured multiple times before.
"Sure, thank you, Wyntor," Nick said.
The next moment, a smile appeared on Wyntor's face. "Have fun," he said again as he walked through one of the doors.
Nick looked at the ticket in his hand with anxiety.
4,800 credits.
He held 4,800 credits in his hand right now.
The most money Nick had ever held in his hands had been 500 after he had finished a quite unsavory job.
4,800 credits was a lot!
Eventually, Nick looked around and found some signs hanging from the ceiling.
Nick's reading comprehension was still weak, but with enough time, he could understand what he was reading.
After wandering around for about three minutes, Nick finally found the entrance to the full-body recovery baths.
Nick slowly opened the door and looked into the room.
It had a couple of lockers and racks for clothing.
"Come in!" a woman shouted with a friendly tone.
Nick awkwardly walked into the room.
He had never been in such a place before.
When the woman in the room noticed Nick's appearance, a pained and apprehensive smile appeared on her face.
Nick just showed her his ticket.
"Right this way, sir," she said with a forced smile as she gestured to one of the doors. "Do you prefer to undertake the cleansing bath with or without clothing?"
"Cleansing bath?" Nick asked. "I thought this is a full-body recovery bath."
The woman just smiled awkwardly. "Sir, it is customary to take a cleansing bath before undertaking a recovery bath. We need you to be clean for the recovery bath to work properly."
"Oh," Nick said. "I'd like to keep my clothing on, then."
"Of course, sir," the woman said as she opened one of the doors to the side. "Please, step inside."
Nick felt out of place, but he followed the woman's instructions.
The room Nick entered was quite small, and he could see five light blue baths.
"Please," the woman said as she gestured towards one of the baths.
Nick awkwardly stepped forward and slowly lowered his body into the bath.
The blue liquid, which didn't feel like water, got pushed out of the bath but was quickly drained.
SSSSSSSS!
The next moment, the water around Nick started to bubble and released sounds akin to boiling water.
It was quite loud.
At the side, the woman's eyes opened widely in shock.
"Wow," she involuntarily commented.
"Oh?" Nick uttered.
"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just surprised," the woman said. "I've never heard the cleansing bath become this loud before."
"This isn't normal?" Nick asked.
"No, it isn't," the woman said. "The cleansing bath is filled with a liquid that gets used up when it comes into contact with dangerous impurities. The more impurities it comes into contact with, the more liquid gets used up, and when the liquid gets used up, it makes this hissing noise."
"But it's never been this loud before."
"If I may ask, what happened?" she asked.
"I fell into the sewers," Nick said.
"Fell into..." the woman said before she trailed off.
She couldn't imagine falling into the sewers.
How would that even happen?
She had never even seen the sewers in her life.
Naturally, since the normal Outer City didn't have rusty metal grates as their flooring, the woman had never seen or smelled the sewers.
Because of that, she also had no idea just how dirty the sewers were.
However, when she saw Nick relaxing, she decided to stop asking questions.
Right now, except for his heavy injuries, Nick felt great.
"Your body has been cleansed," the woman said. "Do you prefer a quick cleansing shower for your head, or are you fine with taking a quick dive in the bath?"
"I'll take a quick dive," Nick said.
The woman nodded. "About a minute in total should be enough. You can take multiple dives, of course."
Nick nodded back, took a breath, and went underwater.
For the first time, he was actually happy to be submerged in liquid.
Nick couldn't describe just how great this felt.
After a minute, Nick surfaced again.
"Please, step out," the woman said.
Nick did just that, and when he could finally take a good look at his appearance, his eyes widened.
He had never been so clean before in his entire life!
All the stains in his clothing were gone, and his skin felt so smooth!
However, not everything was great.
Nick saw that his skin had started to swell in multiple places.
Apparently, his wounds were already starting to get infected and swollen.
A moment later, Nick heard a shocked gasp, and he turned to the woman.
"I'm sorry," she said with genuine worry and pity. "I'm so sorry."
Nick wasn't sure what she meant.
Since Nick was now clean, the woman could actually see Nick's injuries properly.
Broken bones, destroyed nails, and bleeding cuts all across his body.
It was like Nick had fallen down a staircase made of swords.
"Please, follow me," she said with a slightly urgent voice as she opened the next door.
Nick did just that.
In the next room, he saw 15 green baths, but compared to the previous baths, there were also several pieces of external equipment.
For example, there were breathing masks beside a couple of the baths.
Nick also saw that people were in four of the baths.
"Please, in here," the woman said as she gestured to one of the baths.
Nick walked over and slowly entered the bath.
As soon as he was fully submerged, he started to feel warm.
The next moment, a breathing mask was put on his face, and a hand gently pushed him into the bath.
It took some getting used to, but eventually, Nick managed to acclimate to staying below the surface.
The feeling the bath gave him was so great and warm that Nick felt himself drift away.
And just a couple of minutes later, Nick fell asleep.



Chapter 28 Uniform
Eventually, Nick woke up.
While everything had felt great, it was not so great that he would finish a whole night's sleep in the bath.
Nick wanted to scratch his nose but accidentally hit the breathing mask.
After that, he remembered where he was, and he quickly sat up in the bath.
The bath was filled with a liquid denser than water, which was why Nick didn't swim in it.
When Nick poked his head out, he saw one other person in the baths, but he didn't remember that one.
'The others probably already left.'
The next moment, Nick's eyes met with one of the employees, and the employee walked over.
It was a woman in a green uniform, but a different one from before.
After a bit, the employee reached Nick's bath. "Please, take off the mask."
Nick did just that, and the woman looked at Nick's face.
A moment later, she wrote something down on a clipboard. "Do you feel pain anywhere?" she asked neutrally.
Nick moved his shoulders and legs around a bit.
"No, everything feels great," Nick said with surprise.
"And your nose?" the woman asked.
Nick's eyes widened, and he quickly touched his nose.
When he noticed that his nose was also fully healed, he was quite surprised. "It's healed?" he asked in confusion.
The employee nodded. "The healing liquid doesn't need to be in direct contact with the injured area. It also seeps through your skin and travels across your body."
She wrote a bit more on the clipboard before turning the clipboard around and holding it to Nick. "Sign here, and you can go."
Nick slowly and carefully stood up.
Surprisingly, the liquid was falling off him without leaving any stains or making him wet.
The next moment, Nick took the clipboard into his hand and started to read.
…
…
"Are there any problems?" the employee asked with a slightly impatient tone after over two minutes.
"Oh, no," Nick answered quickly. "I'm just not very good at reading."
The employee just rolled her eyes. "It basically just says that you feel healthy and that you want to leave."
Nick nodded. "Okay, but I still want to read it."
The employee got even more annoyed, but she didn't say anything.
After around three more minutes, Nick was finally done.
Luckily, there wasn't a lot written on the clipboard, and it wasn't nearly as hard to understand as the NDA Nick signed.
Eventually, Nick grabbed the pen on the clipboard and awkwardly signed.
He still wasn't used to writing.
Nick handed the clipboard back, and the employee quickly grabbed it.
"Have a nice day. You can go," she said curtly before walking away.
Nick just nodded and walked to the exit.
Luckily, there was a second door, which meant that he didn't need to pass through the room with the cleansing baths again.
Since Nick hadn't put any of his belongings away, he could directly leave.
While Nick was walking through the hospital, he looked around with interest.
His life was no longer in danger, which allowed him to appreciate the look of the hospital.
Everything seemed so… clean.
Nick had never seen anything this clean before.
It felt so alien to him.
Nick had lived in the Dregs for his entire life, and the Dregs were not the cleanest place.
When Nick reached the lobby, he only saw two people.
The receptionist and a boy.
The boy was standing at the side of the lobby with a stack of clothes in his hands, and he awkwardly looked around.
The boy was maybe 14 years old or something like that.
For a second, the eyes of Nick and the boy met.
The boy looked at Nick with anxiety and looked at his clothing.
Then, he looked towards the direction of the baths again.
"You searching for someone?" Nick asked.
The boy was surprised when Nick started a conversation.
"Yes, yes!" the boy answered nervously. "I'm supposed to deliver these clothes to someone called Nick."
Nick blinked twice. "That's me."
"Oh?" the boy uttered as he looked at Nick with surprise.
But then, his brows furrowed as he looked at Nick's clothing again.
"But your clothing isn't dirty," he said.
"I bathed in my clothing," Nick said. "I presume these clothes are from Wyntor?"
When the boy heard Nick say Wyntor's name, he sighed in relief. "Yes," he said.
The next moment, he held the clothes forward, and Nick took them.
Nick couldn't see all of the clothes since they were folded, but he could see quite a bit of red and black.
That was when Nick's eyes widened, and he subconsciously gripped the clothes tighter.
"Is that… Crimson Fungus City's official Zephyx Extractor uniform?" Nick asked in surprise.
The boy nodded with a smile. "Yes, sir."
At this moment, it really hit Nick.
He was a Zephyx Extractor!
Nick had seen a couple of Extractors walking around, and they had worn a uniform just like this one.
Crimson Fungus City required all Zephyx Extractors to wear this uniform, no matter to which company they belonged.
Extractors had to wear the uniform when they were on duty, but they were also encouraged to wear it in their spare time.
While it wasn't mandatory for Extractors to wear their uniforms in their free time, it had become the norm after many lawsuits.
What if an Extractor uses their ability? Would they be on duty or not?
What if someone tried to steal from them and got incinerated by the Extractor's ability?
Of course, the city didn't care about the fate of criminals, but they very much cared about the criminals' bodies and blood.
Even criminals brought in blood and money.
Zephyx Extractors are allowed to kill people from the Dregs with a good reason. Otherwise, they would need to pay a fine of about 5,000 credits.
Extractors are also allowed to kill people of the Outer City, but only when the person tried to physically assault them first.
Because of the many unnecessary deaths, the city encouraged the Extractors to wear their uniform when going out.
Even in their spare time.
'And now, I finally have my very own uniform,' Nick thought as he looked at the uniform in his hand.
'I'm now officially a Zephyx Extractor!'



Chapter 29 Acquaintance
"Thanks," Nick said as he looked at the boy again.
"No problem!" the boy said with a polite smile. "I will be working under you for the foreseeable future, sir."
Nick blinked a couple of times in surprise. "You're working for me?"
The boy nodded. "Yes. I'm a steward apprentice in sir Wyntor's family, sir. I'm going to be working for the two of you for the next couple of months to gain experience. If there is anything you need, just tell me. Please, also tell me if there is anything I can improve."
Nick felt a bit strange being superior to someone else.
He hadn't led anyone before.
"Sure, what's your name?" Nick asked.
"Oh, excuse me!" the boy shouted nervously. "I forgot to introduce myself!"
"My name's Pator Tailor, sir. Please, refer to me as Pator."
Nick nodded. "Alright, Pator. You can call me Nick."
Pator looked quite surprised.
Calling the Chief Zephyx Extractor of a Zephyx Manufacturer by their first name?
"Okay, sure. Thank you," Pator said, not daring to call Nick by his name.
Nick nodded with a smile and walked out of the hospital, Pator following him.
"Where's Wyntor?" Nick asked as they walked towards the warehouse.
"Sir is currently in the family's estate. He told me that you do not need to work for a couple of days," Pator explained.
Nick furrowed his brows. "Why?" he asked.
"I don't know, sir," Pator said. "If I am not told the reason, it means it is not of my concern. However, sir has also said that someone will be telling you all the necessary things in the headquarters."
'Someone's going to tell me these things?' Nick thought with a raised eyebrow.
After walking for a bit, Nick arrived in front of the warehouse.
Whenever Nick saw the warehouse, he had to take a short moment to look at it.
It wasn't anything big or majestic, but it represented his future.
Nick just loved looking at it.
Eventually, Nick walked into the warehouse with Pator in tow.
As soon as Nick entered the warehouse, he immediately became wary.
At this moment, a cloaked figure was closely inspecting the console beside the Containment Unit of the Dreamer.
However, since Wyntor said that someone was waiting for Nick, he didn't immediately attack.
"Please, wait outside, Pator," the cloaked person said without turning around.
When he heard the voice, Pator realized who it was, and he quickly nodded. "Of course, sir."
The next moment, Pator walked out of the warehouse.
Meanwhile, Nick looked at the cloaked person with furrowed brows.
The voice was familiar, but he couldn't quite place it.
The cloaked person turned to Nick.
"How's reading practice going?" the person asked.
And then, Nick suddenly remembered where he had heard that voice from.
"Albert?" Nick asked in surprise.
The cloaked person, Albert, chuckled and removed the cloak, revealing his grey and black hair.
When Nick saw Albert's face, he smiled brightly.
"What are you doing here?" Nick asked as he walked closer.
"Wyntor told me what happened," Albert said. "He thought you might need a bit of guidance since this is your first Specter."
When Nick heard that, he released a sigh of relief.
Naturally, Nick had been quite nervous about the Dreamer.
How was he supposed to get Zephyx out of the Dreamer?
Nick had no idea.
Luckily, Albert was now here, making things much easier.
"Yes, I think I could use some help," Nick said.
Albert chuckled a bit and turned to the console.
"Everything looks fine," he said. "Prephyx levels are elevated, but that's to be expected since it is currently recovering. Zephyx levels are at zero, but that's also expected. The Dreamer is not a Specter that passively gives off Zephyx."
"I already took a look at it earlier, and I have to say, you really went to town on this one," Albert said with a chuckle. "The poor thing is so beat up that it doesn't even want to move right now. It didn't even move when I poked it."
Nick looked with a worried look at Albert. "It's not dying, right?"
"Oh, nah, you don't need to worry about that. It's quite hard to kill a Specter. To kill it, you would need to destroy the core in its head or shred its torso to pieces. Injuries that would kill humans just put Specters in a sort of stasis or hibernation, and as long as they are not isolated from Prephyx, they will recover quite rapidly," Albert explained.
Nick nodded in relief.
He didn't know what he would have done if the Dreamer died after all that had happened.
"Everything looks good," Albert said once more as he lightly slapped the console.
Then, he turned to Nick. "Wanna go get Zephyx out of it right now?"
Nick raised an eyebrow. "Wyntor said that the Dreamer is too injured to be worked with and that it will take a couple of days."
Albert's smile widened. "He's right."
Then, Albert took a small bottle out of one of his pockets and waved it around a bit. "But he doesn't know I have this."
"What's that?" Nick asked as he looked at the bottle with interest.
"The stuff you've been bathing in," Albert said, "Just a lot stronger."
Nick remembered the green bath as he looked at the green liquid.
"Wait, you're using that on the Dreamer?" Nick asked.
"Why not?" Albert asked with a grin.
"Well, what if something happens?" Nick asked.
Albert just snorted. "What's supposed to happen? Nick, I'm a level four Extractor. I can kill the Dreamer with a casual kick."
Nick scratched the back of his head.
Sure, Albert was powerful, but Nick still felt that it was a bit weird to heal a Specter with expensive medicine.
"I mean, sure, if you want to," Nick said with a shrug.
Albert's smile widened, and he mischievously moved his eyebrows up and down.
Then, Albert pressed a button on the console, and a moment later, the personnel door to the Containment Unit opened.
Albert walked in without hesitation, and Nick followed him nervously.



Chapter 30 Negotiation
The lights in the Containment Unit had already been turned on.
Every second the lights were on was expensive, but it was a necessary expenditure.
After all, they couldn't work with the Specter in the dark.
When Nick entered the Containment Unit, he saw a black shadow in the corner of the room.
The Dreamer was lying in the most distant corner, unmoving.
"Alright, princess," Albert said loudly as he walked towards the Dreamer. "Enough moping around."
The Dreamer didn't move.
Albert opened the small bottle and very carefully removed one drop of liquid with his finger.
Then, he just wiped his finger on the Dreamer's head and moved back a bit.
A moment later, the Dreamer's body twitched, and then, its body began to smoke.
Nick saw how the Dreamer's eyes were regrowing at a visible speed.
On top of that, its broken wings and ribs were moving back into place with cracking sounds.
Around a minute later, the Dreamer had fully recovered.
Even though Nick knew that he was safe behind Albert, he still felt a bit nervous.
After all, this was a Specter.
The Dreamer slowly opened its eyes and looked around the Containment Unit.
Then, its eyes fell on Nick.
DING! DING! DING! DING!
Suddenly, a loud alarm sounded in the room.
Nick knew what this alarm meant.
The alarm sounded when a sharp spike in Prephyx levels inside the Containment Unit was measured.
A sudden spike in Prephyx levels meant that the Specter was preparing an attack.
Apparently, the Dreamer wasn't the biggest fan of Nick.
An instant later, the Dreamer shot to its feet and charged at Nick.
"Hol' up, missy!"
BANG!
Albert's left hand opened and grabbed the Dreamer's head in a fluid motion.
The Dreamer flapped around and used its talons to stab Albert's torso.
DING!
Yet, when the Dreamer's talons hit Albert's torso, a metallic sound reverberated throughout the room, and Albert wasn't injured in the slightest.
DING! DING! DING!
The Dreamer used several more attacks, but no matter what it did, Albert wasn't injured in the slightest.
Albert didn't even move.
After about 30 seconds, the Dreamer gave up.
Obviously, this man right in front of it was far more powerful than it was.
"There we go," Albert said as he put the Dreamer down again. "Now, can we have a normal conversation?"
The Dreamer just glared at the distant Nick.
It really didn't like Nick.
"Just ignore him for now," Albert said, moving to stand between the Dreamer and Nick.
The next moment, Albert squatted to be at eye level with the Dreamer.
Surprisingly, the Dreamer also looked into Albert's eyes.
There was no fear in its eyes.
"You're a Specter that feeds on mentality," Albert said. "You're not a Specter that feeds off blood, organs, bodies, death, or unfortunate circumstances."
"You feed on mentality, which means that you have gone through enough memories to understand what I am saying. I'm quite sure of it."
The Dreamer didn't show any reaction.
"I'm not sure if you realize your current circumstances. So, let me enlighten you."
"You have been captured, and you are inside a Containment Unit from a Zephyx Manufacturer."
The Dreamer showed no reaction.
"You are not going to break out. That's not going to happen. This is your new home indefinitely."
"However, if you manage to gain the trust of the company, we might be able to enter a cooperation in the future."
"At that point, you can leave the Containment Unit."
"But until then, you are stuck here, and I'm also quite sure that you know why we humans catch Specters, right?"
The Dreamer showed no reaction.
"We want Zephyx. The stuff you produce when you absorb all that energy from the atmosphere," Albert explained.
"As long as you give us Zephyx, your life won't be bad. We will even help you in becoming stronger."
"The stronger you become, the more Prephyx and Zephyx you contain, which leaves less Prephyx and Zephyx for all the Specters that are still roaming free. Increasing your power is also in our interest."
"Because of that, we will not be stealing all of your Zephyx. Only the majority. The precise amount is not up to me, but that's how it usually works."
"We give you food. You give us Zephyx. You become stronger. We get money."
"Understand?"
The Dreamer showed no reaction.
It just kept on looking forward.
"Alright," Albert said as he stood up again. "Let me give you a couple of hours to think. Now, my little friend over here will be doing most of the work. So, I don't want you to attack him."
The Dreamer moved slightly to the side so that it could look at Nick again.
Nick just looked back emotionlessly.
The next moment, Albert took out a little gadget from one of his pockets and looked at it.
"Man, it really doesn't like you," Albert said to Nick with a chuckle. "Specters aren't usually that angry when they get captured, you know?"
The gadget Albert had in his hand was a mobile Prephyx scanner. It had the same function as the alarm from earlier, but it was portable and had a higher sensitivity.
Just now, the Prephyx levels had been going up and down, almost like the Dreamer debated attacking Nick again.
"Now, listen here. One more thing," Albert said, pushing the Dreamer's head to look at him again.
"If you don't cooperate, we'll have to do the bargain bin method, and you don't want that."
Nick raised an eyebrow. 'Bargain bin method?'
The Dreamer looked at Albert again.
"Most Specters cooperate to some degree. Not all of them cooperate fully, but they, at least, consume stuff to continue growing, which produces Zephyx."
"But there are also the Specters that completely refuse to do anything. They believe that they can simply use up our money by forcing us to spend resources on keeping them contained without gaining anything from them."
"These Specters are not very popular with the Manufacturers, but there is still a way to get money out of them."
The next moment, Albert grabbed the tip of the Dreamer's right wing.
RIIIIP!
And tore it off.
The Dreamer pulled its wing back, but it didn't seem like it was in pain.
Albert showed the Dreamer the part of the wing he had torn off.
Then, Albert took out a small box with a shredder on top.
Albert put the part of the Dreamer he had torn off onto the shredder, and the shredder immediately turned the part into tiny particles.
After that, the wires all over the box started to electrify, and a minute later, the particles in the box vanished.
Albert opened the box and showed it to the Dreamer.
"You get it?" Albert asked.
The Dreamer looked into the box.
Just now, it had felt a bit of Zephyx coming out of the box.
"That's the bargain bin method," Albert said. "We can tear about 70% of your body off without killing you. We shove that body into the mixer, get our Zephyx, and give you a week to recover."
Albert slowly stood up.
"Either you cooperate, or that's your future."
"It's your decision."
"We'll be back in about three hours."
After that, Albert walked out of the Containment Unit.
The Dreamer just looked at Nick.
Nick looked back, but he also left a couple of seconds later.
The Dreamer just kept looking at the door.



Chapter 31 Old Lady
After Albert and Nick left the Containment Unit, Nick just looked at Albert with a raised eyebrow. "So, you just talk to them?"
Albert just laughed. "At least that's the first thing we try generally. It doesn't take a lot of resources, and it's rather quick. Might as well try this before we invest lives and energy."
"Does it actually work?" Nick asked.
"Sometimes. Not always, though," Albert said. "The thing is, the Dreamer is a Specter that feeds on mentality, which means it actually understands humans to a certain degree. It might not be able to articulate itself or learn how to speak, but it should be able to understand most of what we say."
"Working with a Specter that feeds on mentality can be a blessing and a curse at the same time."
"It's a blessing since you can almost always communicate directly with them, making most things very smooth."
"But it can also be a curse since Specters that feed on mentality are generally much more intelligent than other kinds of Specters."
"Specters like these breach almost as much as Force Specters."
"Like, there is this one Specter called the Old Lady. She is constantly in agony and pain, but she is still extremely friendly. Extractors can extract Zephyx simply by talking with her."
"I worked with her a couple of times. She's actually very easy to work with, and it is even fun at times. She is a great conversationalist, and she always shows real care towards my problems. At least when she's not wincing in pain or complaining about the darkness or her loneliness."
Nick looked sympathetic when he heard Albert's description.
But the next moment, Albert suddenly pointed at Nick's face. "That! That's what she's after. Pity!"
"The Old Lady feeds on pity."
"On pity?" Nick asked.
Albert nodded. "Yep. She grows more powerful by eliciting pity from people. By being nice to them and making them like you, they are far more likely to feel bad for your circumstances. That's why it's such a great time to talk to her."
"In like the first year of her being in the Containment Unit, she breached three times. Just for your info, that's a lot!" Albert said.
"The first one was when one of the clerks got to know her and decided to free her. Of course, a rational human being wouldn't do something like that since they would essentially forfeit their life, but Specters that feed on mentality have many subtle mental influences that can cloud your judgment."
"Naturally, when the Old Lady came out, she immediately killed the clerk to make sure that she didn't call anyone."
"After that, she tried to get out of the building, but she ran across an off-duty Extractor, who rapidly suppressed her and put her back in the Containment Unit."
"The second time was after she had worked and talked with the same Extractor for around a month."
"Back then, we saw no issues, but it turned out that the more you talked to her, the closer your attachment to her."
"So, after working with her for over a month, the Extractor essentially became her eternal servant but never showed any signs on the outside."
"Naturally, the Extractor busted her out, and the two of them ran away."
"Five people died on their escape."
"It took several days to catch them, and funnily enough, a different Manufacturer captured them, which meant that the Old Lady now belonged to a completely different company."
The next moment, Albert laughed loudly.
"And then she broke out again within a week by getting a clerk to free her again, and the first Manufacturer recaptured her."
"She hasn't broken out since then. They constantly rotate clerks and Extractors, making sure that everyone only gets to talk to her once a week."
Nick blinked a couple of times in surprise.
He had expected that, as soon as the Specters were in the Containment Units, they would remain there.
But now, he had heard of a Specter that had breached three times in a year via multiple ways.
"So, yeah," Albert said, looking at Nick. "They are easy to work with, but if you are careless even once, they will breach and cause you massive trouble."
Nick could only nod.
"And the Dreamer is one of those," Nick commented.
"Yep," Albert said. "I'm pretty certain that the Dreamer will agree to work with us, but if you are careless in any way, it will not hesitate to kill anyone to get out."
"Nick, I'm going to tell you something that my old mentor has told me. Back then, I didn't believe him, but after decades of working with Specters, I can tell you that he spoke the truth."
Albert put his hands on Nick's shoulders and looked him deep in the eyes.
"Specters can not feel happiness, companionship, or pity," Albert said solemnly.
"After decades of research performed by thousands of Extractors, we have found not even a single Specter that can feel any of these things."
"Whenever you see them being in pain or being supportive, it is only an act. They want to get closer to you in some way for some sort of gain."
"Never believe them."
"Never become their friend."
"Never try to ally with them unless you know that working for you is more beneficial for the Specter than being free. Specters will always do what is most beneficial to them."
"And even then, there are Specters that act chaotically, against their own interests."
"Every Specter is unique, and every Specter needs to be treated differently."
"Even the Blood Mosquito is contained inside a special Containment Unit. It has worked together with Crimson Fungus City for decades, but they still don't dare to let its main body out of their sight."
"Kugelblitz always has at least two level four Extractors or a level five Extractor stationed near the Blood Mosquito, even though there has been no issue with it for decades."
"That's how careful you have to be of them."
"Do you understand?" Albert asked with a serious tone.
Nick took a deep breath.
Then, he nodded with conviction.
"I will never feel empathy for a Specter!"



Chapter 32 Stages
"Good," Albert said with a sigh. "Anyway, how about I tell you about some general things regarding working with other Specters?"
"Sounds good," Nick said.
The next moment, Nick and Albert walked over to the side of the warehouse and sat in some chairs.
For the next three hours, Albert taught Nick about general techniques for working with different Specters.
The more Nick heard, the gloomier he felt.
Apparently, there were quite a great number of Specters that simply gained power by killing people, and they only produced Zephyx that way.
These kinds of Specters were either amazing or almost worthless.
It all depended on the moral flexibility of the Manufacturer and their standing in the community.
As the de-facto owner of the city, Kugelblitz didn't use any unsavory methods like this, but there were a couple of Manufacturers that did just that.
Naturally, Kugelblitz acted like the righteous authority and tried to uncover the obvious practices of the Manufacturers, but behind closed curtains, they were most likely paid off to look the other way.
These other Manufacturers mostly got their Zephyx from dying people.
An old person has a horrible disease that will eventually lead to their death?
Hey, want to earn a ton of money for the family you're leaving behind? You just gotta die a bit earlier.
And apparently, there were always enough sick people, even though Albert said that the hygiene and cleanliness in the Inner City was brutally high.
Albert even went as far as to say that getting sick in the Inner City without outside influence was nearly impossible.
Albert didn't directly say it, but he suspected that the Manufacturers were using shady methods to spread these diseases, but none of that had been proven yet.
Naturally, Nick was not really worried about all of that but about what he would do if he captured such a Specter.
Killing someone just for a bit of money?
That felt unacceptable to him.
Sadly, the only other option to get Zephyx out of these kinds of Specters was to use the bargain bin method, and when Albert mentioned the bargain bin method again, he actually chuckled in embarrassment.
Under Nick's stunned gaze, Albert told him that Wyntor actually didn't own a shredder like the one Albert had shown him.
Apparently, the cheapest method to shred parts of Specters was buying a huge shredder that cost Zephyx to operate.
Its prize was two million credits, over four times as much as the Containment Unit the Dreamer was currently in.
Wyntor didn't have the finances to purchase something like that.
When Albert had said that they would just grind the Dreamer down, he had lied.
"So, if the Dreamer refuses, we are essentially stuck?" Nick asked.
"Well," Albert said as he scratched his chin. "Not exactly."
"If, for some reason, the Dreamer completely refuses to work with you, you can still sell it."
"The Dreamer is not a newborn Specter. I think it is in the Mid, if not Late, Hatchling Stage. That's worth quite a bit."
"Hatchling Stage?" Nick asked with a raised eyebrow.
"Oh yeah," Albert said. "That's what we Extractors call the different levels of the Specters. The official designation is simply level-based. Level one, two, three, and so on, but we Extractors decided to come up with an unofficial one."
"Hatchlings are level one Specters."
"Adolescents are level two Specters."
"Adults are level three Specters."
"Elders are level four Specters."
"Fanatics are level five Specters."
"Wow, wait," Nick said. "Why are they suddenly called Fanatics? Everything up to this point seemed to follow an age progression."
Albert chuckled a bit. "Mainly because level five Specters and stronger have this thing where some people start worshipping them due to their power and influence. For example, the Parasite has a secret cult, and all the Manufacturers are trying their best to get rid of it since the cult kills people and delivers corpses to the Parasite."
"Anyway, level six Specters are Demons. We call them like this due to their extreme power and danger."
"Level seven Specters are Fallen."
"Level eight Specters are called Adversaries. Mainly because they pose the biggest problem to humanity as a whole."
"Really?" Nick asked. "What about the level nine Specters?"
"First of all, there are fewer level nine Specters than level eight Specters."
"Second, the five level nine Specters are already an integral part of our lives, which we can't escape from. Their existence determines the baseline of humanity as a whole."
"So, in a bizarre way, the level nine Specters are not humanity's enemies but the judges of humanity's prosperity."
"In contrast, we can still somewhat resist the level eight Specters, and the level eight Specters are doing their very best to suppress humanity."
"If you view humanity as a big company, you could view the level eight Specters as the chief executives and the level nine Specters as the owners. The owners very rarely come into contact with the employees, and they are rarely noticed by the employees, but when they arrive, even the chief executives have to be beyond respectful."
"In comparison, the chief executives are the ones making all the decisions and dictating how everyone feels. So, while the level nine Specters are more powerful, they do whatever they want, which means, in a way, they are not the collective enemy of humanity."
"It's a bit weird to explain."
"It's like, one is a huge monster, and the other is a natural catastrophe. You can't really view a natural catastrophe as an enemy or fight it, you know?"
Nick scratched his chin.
"Oh, by the way, what are level nine Specters called?"
"Eternal," Albert answered. "They are just called Eternals."
Nick nodded. "Is there something similar for Extractors?"
Albert nodded.
"Level one Extractors are called Newbies."
"Level two are called Johns."
"John?" Nick asked with a raised eyebrow.
Albert laughed. "Yes, John. Level two Extractors are the most numerous and most average. They used to be called John Doe, but it was shortened to just Johns. The most common and generic Extractors get the most common and generic name."
"Johns," Nick repeated. "You're serious?"
"I'm absolutely serious," Albert said with a suppressed chuckle.
"If everything works out, you will also become a John one day."
Nick just blinked once.



Chapter 33 Charge
After a while, Nick just sighed.
It seemed like Extractors were quite casual.
"What about level three Extractors?" Nick asked.
"Veterans," Albert answered. "They already worked a lot with Specters, which is why they are called Veterans."
"Level four Extractors are called Experts. I'm an Expert," Albert said with a smile.
"level five Extractors are called Specialists. Crimson Fungus City has fewer than 30 of those."
"Level six Extractors are called Heroes."
"Heroes?" Nick asked.
"Yep, because if there is something threatening the city, they are the ones saving us, and without them, this city wouldn't even exist," Albert explained. "Without the Heroes, all of us wouldn't be alive right now. Heroes represent the strongest existences we can get into contact with."
Nick raised an eyebrow. "But what about the level seven and level eight Extractors?"
"They're special," Albert said. "Normal cities only have Extractors up to level six."
"Level seven Extractors count as legends, and they have dedicated their lives to helping humanity against the Specters."
"Level seven Extractors are the ones keeping humanity safe from the Fallen, the level seven Specters."
"There are less than a hundred level seven Extractors."
"They are called the Protectors."
"And as for level eight Extractors…" Albert said before trailing off.
Then, he released a deep sigh.
"We are forever stuck with only having seven of them."
"We will never be able to have more than seven."
"Why?" Nick asked with furrowed brows.
"The Maw," Albert answered. "The Maw just loves pitting similarly powerful Extractors against each other, and it always takes eight."
"So, if we ever get an eighth level eight Extractor, the Maw will take all of them."
"In the end, only one will come out."
"Meanwhile, there are over 40 level eight Specters."
Nick became silent when he heard that.
Seven versus over forty.
The level eight Extractors were fighting a hopeless battle.
"And what are they called?" Nick asked.
"Well, for all intents and purposes, they should be called Heroes, but since normal people keep referring to level six Extractors as Heroes, we had to choose a different name."
"So, we decided to name them after what they are doing."
"They are unable to injure our enemy, but at least they are able to shield us from the worst our enemy can throw at us."
"That's why we call them Shields."
Nick remained silent for a while.
He could feel how noble and selfless the seven Shields were.
Without them, the Adversaries, the level eight Specters, would have already run rampant.
"Is there a name for a potential level nine Extractor?" Nick asked.
Albert remained silent for a while.
"Well, a level nine Extractor would be able to resist the Eternals, and they would have the power to actually win against the Specters as a whole."
"Someone like that could only be called our Savior."
Nick just nodded without saying anything.
Level seven and level eight Extractors seemed to be very different from all the other Extractors, according to what Albert had said.
The weaker Extractors were still working for the different cities and effectively running them, but level seven and level eight Extractors were focusing on protecting humanity from the Specters.
However, Nick wasn't naïve. He knew exactly that it wasn't possible that every single level seven Extractor was some kind of selfless saint who dedicated their life to fighting for humanity.
This meant that there were either more level seven Extractors or every level seven Extractor was forced to fight for humanity.
Nick wished that the second option was true, but he guessed that the first one was more likely to be true.
'The truly powerful people have a chance at actually changing the world for the better.'
'Someone that has the power to change something should have a duty to change things.'
'So many people want to change the world for the better but lack the power. Because of that, I believe that when you have the power, you have a duty to make the world a better place.'
'I wouldn't be opposed to forcing the strong humans to fight for humanity.'
'They don't need to sacrifice their lives, but they need to put in a real effort.'
Nick sighed.
'However, all of that doesn't matter. I am weak, and my opinion and actions have nearly no effect on the world as a whole.'
'For now, I should focus on what's in front of me.'
"Should we go back to the Dreamer?" Nick asked.
"Oh, has it been three hours already?" Albert asked.
Nick nodded.
"Alright, then, go in."
Nick blinked a couple of times in surprise. "You're not coming with me?"
"Nope," Albert said. "This is your Specter. I showed you how to work with it and helped you a bit, but that was it."
"You're the Chief Zephyx Extractor. You're the one in charge of all Specters and Extractors. It is your duty to manage the facility. If you can't keep the Specters in check, you won't be able to get any Zephyx from them, at which point you have to sell them," Albert explained.
Nick took a deep breath. "I understand."
Naturally, Nick knew that he was the one in charge, but it was still difficult to come to terms with it.
Nick had never led anyone, and he was still only 16 years old.
Having the fate of an entire corporation hanging on his actions alone made his chest feel tight and his shoulders heavy.
Usually, one could almost always ask someone more powerful or more experienced.
A child could ask an adult about what to do.
An employee could ask their supervisor.
A supervisor could ask a manager.
A soldier could ask an officer.
And Nick?
He was the one in charge.
Well, technically, Wyntor was in charge, but Wyntor didn't have much to do with the Specters themselves.
'I guess I have to learn to take control and to lead people,' Nick thought with a sigh.
'It just feels so weird.'
'I'm not entirely sure what I should do.'
Nick took a deep breath and stood up.
'Well, I won't get an answer by just thinking about it.'
Then, he walked towards the Containment Unit of the Dreamer.



Chapter 34 Work
Nick operated the console and opened the entrance for the employees.
The light in the Containment Unit sprang on, and Nick immediately saw the Dreamer after opening the door.
The Dreamer was standing near one of the walls.
Nick wasn't sure if he preferred this position over the one where the Dreamer just lay in the corner.
Nick stepped into the Containment Unit with confidence, and the door closed behind him.
Nick looked at the Dreamer.
The Dreamer looked at Nick.
Silence.
Nick's heart began to race.
At this moment, Nick's ability obviously didn't work, and the employee door took a couple of seconds to open.
This meant that if the Dreamer decided to attack, Nick would have to fight it for a couple of seconds before Albert could get in or Nick out.
'I can't rely on Albert,' Nick thought as he looked at the Dreamer with narrowed eyes. 'Albert is only here for today. Even if he saves me now, he won't be able to save me tomorrow.'
'Remember, Albert said that Specters always do what's most beneficial to them.'
'The Dreamer is not powerful enough to escape from the Containment Unit. Even if it kills me, it won't be able to get out, and I'm certain it knows that.'
'Because of that, attacking me would only antagonize the Manufacturer it now belongs to, reducing our trust in it and making its life more difficult.'
'If I were in its position, I would want to play the good boy until I get enough Zephyx to become a level two Specter, an Adolescent, before breaking out of the Containment Unit.'
The Dreamer and Nick were still silently looking at each other.
The Dreamer had no expression whatsoever, and Nick had no idea what it was thinking or feeling right now.
It just kept staring at him like a statue.
"I presume you are willing to work with us," Nick said. "I think you would have attacked me if you didn't agree."
"Smart decision."
The Dreamer just kept looking at Nick.
"We both know my power, and we both know that you are superior to me in every way as long as you can see me."
"However, we also know that I can still avoid your attacks for a while, and compared to before, we are now on my home turf."
"I only need to survive until the door is open."
The Dreamer didn't do anything.
Naturally, the Dreamer's lack of reaction increased Nick's heart rate.
It was just too creepy to look at something that was alive but deliberately acted like it was not.
"Of course, you still have a genuine chance to kill me."
The Dreamer didn't do anything.
"But you have also noticed the alarms earlier, and I'm pretty sure you already figured out when the alarm gets triggered."
"If you decide to attack me, I will know before you actually attack."
The Dreamer just kept staring emotionlessly and silently.
DING! DING! DING!
The next moment, the alarm rang, and Nick immediately put his hand on the console of the door behind him.
However, he didn't press it.
Instead, he only glared at the Dreamer.
Surprisingly, the Dreamer just kept standing there.
It was almost like it hadn't done anything.
"You get it now?" Nick asked.
Naturally, the Dreamer had tested out the alarm.
It wanted to know if the past activations had just been coincidences or not.
And it didn't like what it saw.
Whenever it was thinking about launching an attack, the alarm rang.
The alarm activated so fast that the Dreamer wasn't even sure whether or not it had actually wanted to attack.
It felt very bizarre.
It was almost like the alarm could tell the future.
"Okay," Nick said as he walked away from the door.
Then, he slowly walked towards the Dreamer.
Since the Dreamer currently stood on the ground, it seemed almost harmless.
After all, it was just a barely 50-centimeter-tall owl.
Sure, it was quite a big bird, but that was it.
However, Nick knew how powerful the Dreamer actually was.
Step by step, Nick closed in on the Dreamer.
Eventually, only a single meter separated them.
The entire time, the two of them only looked into each other's eyes.
Silence.
The Dreamer didn't attack.
Naturally, Nick's heart rate was quite elevated at this moment, and adrenaline was coursing through his body.
However, he also knew that he had to get through this.
If he didn't manage to work with the Dreamer, he couldn't call himself the Chief Zephyx Extractor.
He had to be able to work with the most powerful Specters of the company.
"Good," Nick said. "Then, let's start working."
The next moment, Nick turned around and walked to one of the walls.
Then, he sat down with his back to the wall.
"You gain power by giving people nightmares, right?"
The Dreamer didn't answer.
"When you gain power, you give off the stuff we want."
"Albert!" Nick shouted as he looked towards one of the walls. "Set the conversion rate to 90% for now."
Some seconds passed.
"Done!" Albert's voice came from one of the speakers in the corner.
Nick nodded and looked back at the Dreamer.
"For now, we will take 90%, and you get to keep 10%. Naturally, that is very much in our favor, but for now, that's your only option."
"If you prove to be trustworthy, we will allow you to retain more Zephyx. After all, if you manage to become an Adolescent, we will also get more Zephyx."
"You growing stronger is also in our interest."
"But for now, we have to be careful of you."
The next moment, Nick took a deep breath.
"I will try to fall asleep in here, and you do your thing."
"However, keep in mind that I am currently the only person willing to work with you using this method. If I accidentally die, we will only have the bargain bin method left, and we might not trust you anymore, which means you stay a Hatchling forever."
"Don't do anything stupid."
And then, Nick closed his eyes.



Chapter 35 Falling Asleep
Nick's eyes remained closed.
On the inside, Nick's heart was still racing, and he felt very nervous, but on the outside, he seemed calm.
He wanted to open his eyes several times, but he forced them closed.
Time passed.
Clink.
Nick's eyes slowly opened.
Just now, the Dreamer took a step forward, its black eyes fully focused on Nick's eyes.
It was still as expressionless as earlier.
Nick covertly took a very deep breath and closed his eyes.
Clink.
Nick's eyes remained closed.
Clink.
Clink.
Clink.
Clink!
Clink!
CLINK CLINK!
The last two steps had come within a short moment from Nick's right side.
He knew that the Dreamer was currently standing directly beside him.
Nick slowly opened his eyes and turned his head to the side.
Black eyes!
Nick's body shuddered as his vision was almost completely taken up by two black eyes.
While sitting, Nick could almost see eye to eye with the Dreamer, and right now, the Dreamer's eyes were just 20 centimeters away from Nick's eyes.
If the Dreamer just used its beak to peck him, Nick would probably lose one eye before he could react.
The more Nick looked into those eyes, the more he felt like they were empty.
Usually, when someone got more familiar with something, they managed to see subtle signs that told them more about the thing they were familiar with.
Not here.
The more Nick learned about the Dreamer, the more he felt like he was just looking into an emotionless ghost or something similar.
There was no disregard, hunger, rage, hatred, or whatever in its eyes.
It was almost like it wasn't even conscious.
It was like it was just a dead statue.
But it wasn't.
And that was why Nick felt so nervous right now.
It felt wrong.
Nick felt like the Dreamer wasn't supposed to exist.
It was not dead, but it didn't act like it was alive.
Nevertheless, Nick took a deep breath and closed his eyes again.
Time passed.
Minutes passed.
The Dreamer had not moved ever since it had stepped beside Nick.
After 30 minutes had passed, Nick wasn't even sure whether or not the Dreamer was actually beside him.
Usually, one could feel when someone was right beside them.
Breathing, slight movements, the change in the wind, the smell, some noise.
None of that was here.
The Dreamer didn't breathe, smell, or move, and since there was also no wind in here, it also couldn't block it.
It was like Nick was alone.
Usually, Nick would prefer this feeling.
After all, most people wanted to sleep alone.
But the fact that he knew that the Dreamer, a Specter, was right beside him made it impossible for him to calm down.
Nevertheless, Nick did his best to calm down.
However, Nick knew that this state of affairs would continue for a long time.
'How am I supposed to fall asleep with that thing right beside me?'
It was difficult enough to sleep under normal circumstances, but it was even more difficult when something you didn't trust was looking right at you.
But Nick tried.
"Nick," came the quiet voice of Albert from one of the speakers.
"Yes?" Nick asked quietly.
"The Prephyx levels are slowly rising, but my scanner says that they are not in preparation for an attack. You should inform the next person of this occurrence lest they make a miscall and rush in."
"Tell me if you feel a change."
Nick nodded slowly. "I will."
Nick hadn't opened his eyes yet.
Some moments later, Nick's mind was getting woozy.
Images from what happened that day weaved in and out of his consciousness, and Nick felt like he was losing focus.
The next moment, Nick yawned deeply.
He was about to fall asleep.
That was when Nick noticed it.
He had just expected that he would be sitting here for hours, but now, he felt very tired and was about to fall asleep?
"I am getting very tired, and I think I will fall asleep soon, Albert," Nick said. "I think the Dreamer is helping me fall asleep."
"Noted," Albert said. "Just fall asleep. I'm here if anything happens."
"If you are still asleep after eight hours, I will come in and wake you up."
Nick yawned deeply again. "Sounds great."
"Good night," Nick said in a sleepy voice.
Outside, Albert was looking at the console with a complex expression.
"Yes… good night," he answered awkwardly.
Albert just threw a glance out of the window as if to confirm whether or not it was night.
'Why am I even looking outside? I can only see the sun through the upper windows, and the sun isn't related to the time of day,' Albert thought as he shook his head.
Inside the Containment Unit, Nick felt his mind melt into different scenes.
Today had been a very busy day.
After waking up in the early morning, Nick and Wyntor had prepared themselves for their excursion.
At noon, Nick had jumped into the sewers, and he had continually been swimming in them for over ten hours.
Then, Nick had been tortured by the Nightmare, which had significantly drained his mind.
After that, Nick had fought the Dreamer in a life-and-death battle before finally subduing it.
And then, they even needed to walk several kilometers into the actual Outer City, at which point they had a short scuffle with some guards.
At least Nick had been able to take a short nap in the healing bath, but after that, he had spent another three hours in the company itself.
The fact that he had still been able to pay attention to Albert's teachings after that much had happened was surprising.
And now, Nick had been over half an hour in the presence of the Dreamer while trying not to open his eyes.
It was so much.
So much shit had happened today.
But now, Nick felt calm.
He could finally let go and get a good night's sleep.
At this moment, for whatever reason, Nick had completely forgotten the presence of the Dreamer right beside him.
Some seconds later, Nick's back and legs became weak, and his body slumped.
The Dreamer kept looking at the sleeping Nick.
On the outside, Albert looked at the different graphs on the console, and he took a deep breath when one of the graphs showed a curve traveling upward.
This was the graph for Zephyx production.
At this moment, the Dreamer was producing Zephyx.
Nick was successfully working with it!



Chapter 36 Bad Dream
"I'm sorry! Please! I won't do it again!"
Nick shouted in absolute terror as he did his best to beg for his life on his broken legs.
BANG!
The next moment, Nick's face was kicked in by a metallic boot.
"Plehs, ahm surry," Nick cried through his crushed face.
"You are the reason why Young Master Wyntor is dead," one of the three armored people in front of him spoke. "Your carelessness is why the Lord is now grieving."
"I didn't mean to! I'm sorry!" Nick said through his crushed teeth.
BANG!
The metallic boot crushed Nick's forearm, and Nick began to scream even more.
Nick tried to get his crushed forearm out from under the boot, which was grinding Nick's forearm into a crunchy paste of meat and bone.
"You think saying sorry will help you?" the person spoke calmly and coldly through his black gas mask.
"But don't worry, you won't die today."
The black gasmask was coming closer to Nick's face.
"You will stay alive for as long as the Lord commands it."
"He has many ways to keep you alive when your body begs to die."
"No! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Please!"
Nick just kept shouting garbled words through the crushed mess that had once been his face.
"Take him away," the man said as he turned around to walk away.
"No! No!"
Nick just kept shouting as the two other people grabbed him.
The next moment, Nick found himself impaled onto a wooden cross with three spikes.
Two were going through Nick's wrists, and one was going through both his legs.
"Interesting, isn't it?" the disfigured and small man in front of Nick said with a loud but awkward chuckle.
"This is the most popular and famous torture method from the old world!" the torturer said. "We found many depictions of this torture method in the ruins."
"You should consider yourself lucky! After all, not everyone gets to reenact such a monumental piece of history with their own body."
After deciding for a while, the disfigured man took hold of a thin and small knife.
Nick didn't show any reactions.
"Alright, you know how this goes. Just don't move too much, okay?" the man shouted with an awkward laugh.
The next moment, the torturer stepped on a small ladder behind the cross and put the knife on the underside of Nick's right big toe.
And then, he cut into it.
The knife methodically moved towards the center of Nick's foot.
While this was happening, Nick's body was shuddering, but he wasn't saying anything.
"Alright, that's the first one. Keep holding still. If you do a good job, you get a couple of days of peace in the drowning cage."
Then, the torturer slowly cut down from the second toe.
Then, the third, and so on.
Eventually, all the cuts met in the middle of the underside of Nick's feet.
"Now, let's see…"
The next moment, the torturer grabbed both sides of one of the cuts and pulled to the side.
RIIIIIP!
After ripping them to the side a bit, the torturer took hold of the knife again while the other hand kept Nick's skin off from his flesh.
The next moment, the torturer slowly and carefully cut the connective tissue between Nick's skin and his flesh.
Nick gritted his teeth, but they had already been filed into thin needles that weren't aligned with each other, essentially forcing them to dig into the opposite gums when he closed his mouth.
Nevertheless, this was all Nick could do.
"Now, look at this beautiful toe," the torturer said as the skin of Nick's big toe lay on top of Nick's toe like wrapping paper for a present.
"Alright, let's do the second one."
As Nick felt a sharp and intense pain come from his second toe, he just opened his eyes lifelessly.
What greeted Nick was the sight of a human's skin hanging from the ceiling a couple of meters in front of him.
Besides that piece of skin were several more.
There were over ten sets of skins, all having different levels of quality.
They had all belonged to Nick at one point.
He had gone through this torture many, many times before.
Whenever the torturer wanted another set, he would pull out Nick's skin and then bathe him in healing liquid.
After that, Nick would get to relax in a cage that was almost completely underwater.
Only by pursing his lips on the top could Nick get a bit of air, and only when the water was calm.
And worst of all, they had cut out Nick's tongue and vocal cords to stop him from saying The Sentence.
This was his life.
This was what his life would become.
It was hopeless.
It was eternal.
The torture was never-ending.
Nick just closed his eyes again.
"Nick?"
Nick felt the reality shake.
"Hey, Nick!"
The next moment, Nick's mind began to swim, and he felt himself getting transported somewhere else.
Nick opened his eyes, and he saw a white light shining onto him.
"Huh?" Nick said in confusion.
Nick's left arm moved upward and touched his head as he grimaced a bit.
"Everything alright?" Albert asked.
"Yeah, I think so," Nick said as he slowly righted himself. "I feel a bit confused and groggy."
"Also, I think I had a really bad dream, but I don't really remember. It's all foggy."
"Right!" Nick said louder as he looked around the white room.
He spotted the Dreamer standing in one of the corners, looking at him.
Then, Nick to his left.
Albert was standing left of him.
"Are eight hours already up?" Nick asked in a bit of confusion.
"Yep," Albert said. "You slept very calmly. No one would think that you were going through a nightmare."
"You did go through one, right?"
Nick's brows furrowed. "I think so. I feel all exhausted, and I feel like I cried and went through hell."
"But I can't remember. I know that something horrible has happened, but I just don't know what exactly."
"It's a strange feeling."
Albert nodded. "Well, whatever you went through worked. You produced a lot of Zephyx. Want to see?"
Nick slowly stood up and shook his head again.
He was still tired.
"Yeah, sure."



Chapter 37 Finances
Nick threw another glance at the Dreamer, which was still looking at him with its emotionless eyes.
Nick had no idea what the Dreamer was feeling or thinking about.
It was like a blank canvas.
Then, Nick left the Containment Unit and followed Albert to the console.
Albert pointed at a small monitor to the side of the console and slapped Nick's shoulders quite roughly. "You seein this?" he shouted with excitement.
Nick looked at the small monitor and saw the gauge of a tank.
This was the Zephyx tank of the Dreamer's Containment Unit.
The gauge had a maximum volume of 50, and right now, it was at a bit over five.
"You managed to get five grams of Zephyx on your first time! That's amazing!" Albert shouted with a laugh.
Nick just looked at the gauge with confusion since he didn't know how much five grams of Zephyx was, but Albert's enthusiasm also made him a bit excited.
"How much is five grams of Zephyx?" Nick asked.
"About 5,000 credits," Albert said with a smirk.
Nick's eyes widened.
How much?!
5,000 credits?!
"But the full-body Healing Bath only cost 4,800 credits," Nick said in a dumbfounded manner.
Nick hadn't had issues with coming up with the taxes each month, but he had never owned more than 500 credits at a time.
500 credits had essentially counted as his life savings.
And now, he had made 5,000 just by sleeping a bit?
If he just kept sleeping in there every single day, wouldn't he make over 100,000 credits per month?
"How much of that will I get?" Nick asked.
"Depends on Wyntor," Albert said. "You have to remember that these 5,000 credits represent an entire day of operations for your company. 5,000 credits are quite a bit, but it's not that much if you want to run a small company."
"For example, just keeping the lights on in the Containment Unit for that long cost you around 650 credits."
Nick's eyes widened. "650 credits for the lights? That's over 10%!"
Albert nodded. "That's why this Containment Unit is so cheap. Almost all other Containment Units use shafts of mirrors to get natural light in them. Over a long period of time, the more expensive Containment Units are more cost-effective."
"Of course, after paying for the lights, you also have to pay the rent of the warehouse."
"Wait, rent?" Nick asked in shock. "I thought this warehouse belonged to us!"
Albert just laughed. "Nick, do you have any idea how expensive such a big house is outside the Dregs? If you want to buy the warehouse, you probably need more than 300,000 credits."
Nick took a deep breath.
"Lighten up," Albert said. "Compared to the light, the rent shouldn't be that bad."
"Based on the location and size, I would guess that Wyntor pays somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 credits per month."
'That's less than a hundred credits per day. It really isn't that bad,' Nick thought.
"Then, you have to pay Pator. After all, he's an employee. Based on his profile, he probably also earns about 2,000 to 3,000 credits per month."
'That's also a bit less than 100 credits per day.'
"After that, we need to consider expansion costs," Albert said. "When you run a company, you keep the company's assets and finances separate from your personal ones. And since you guys want to expand at some point, you will probably save about 50% of the profit."
"The remainder will probably be split between the two of you."
"All in all, I expect that you get around 1,000 credits per day of work for yourself," Albert explained.
Nick slowly nodded.
1,000 credits per day wasn't as much as 5,000 credits per day, but it was still an insane amount to Nick.
"A thousand credits per day," Nick repeated with a distracted voice.
Then, Nick remembered something. "What about the Dreamer? Can it actually produce Zephyx once a day?"
Albert snorted. "Nick, the Dreamer is a Specter that feeds on mentality. Compared to a Specter that feeds on something physical, it doesn't need to digest its food."
"On top of that, Specters don't need to sleep, breathe, or eat."
"The Dreamer can probably go forever."
Then, Albert pointed at Nick. "But you can't."
Nick furrowed his brows. "Why not? I just slept for eight hours, but I feel like I can continue sleeping. You shouldn't underestimate my ability to sleep. If I really want to, I can sleep a looooong time."
Albert slowly shook his head. "That's the issue. You just slept for eight hours, but you feel like you can immediately continue sleeping. That doesn't sound very rested to me."
"Are you tired right now? Do you feel like you've had a good night's sleep?"
Nick looked at the ground with a thoughtful expression.
His mind felt strained. It was almost like he had been awake for over 24 hours.
Even more, Nick still felt like it was the same day he had entered the sewers, which felt strange.
"It's strange," Nick said. "I feel like I haven't slept."
Albert nodded. "That's what I thought."
"Nick, sleeping is a natural process where the body cleans and organizes the mind while your body enters a resting state."
"The Dreamer is changing that process by giving you nightmares. So, instead of your mind reorganizing, it has to experience more things and store more memories. This means that your mind is not essentially sleeping."
Nick furrowed his brows with a frown. "So, I have to sleep again?" he asked as he scratched the back of his head.
Albert nodded. "Yep. You have to actually go to sleep. Working with the Dreamer is just that, work. It is not rest nor sleep."
Nick could only sigh and nod.
He could tell that Albert was right, and he accepted his explanation.
At that moment, the door of the warehouse suddenly opened, and Nick looked over.
The next moment, he saw Wyntor standing beside Pator.
"Oh yeah," Albert said, like he just remembered something. "I sent Pator to get Wyntor about an hour ago or something like that. I thought he would want to know how things went."
The distant Wyntor turned to Pator, nodded, and told him something.
Pator performed a short and polite bow and walked away from the warehouse.
The next moment, Wyntor walked into the warehouse, and the door ominously closed behind him.
Wyntor walked over and stopped in front of Albert and Nick.
"You're not wearing your uniform?" Wyntor asked Nick.



Chapter 38 Murder
Nick's eyes widened. "Right! I totally forgot!"
Then, Nick went over to the side of the warehouse. He had dumped his uniform in this place earlier. After all, it would be a bit awkward to enter the Dreamer's Containment Unit with a stack of clothing in his hands.
"I'll go put it on," Nick shouted as he ran behind the Containment Unit.
Wyntor just shook his head with a sigh.
"He's so different," Wyntor said.
"To whom?" Albert asked.
"The people in the Inner City," Wyntor answered.
Albert chuckled a bit. "Yes, but he's not that much different to how people in the Dregs are. Well, he's a bit more altruistic than the average person, but I've seen my fair share of interesting events while teaching him in the Dregs."
Wyntor didn't seem convinced as he continued looking at the Containment Unit.
"Are you sure? I thought, since resources are so scarce, the people in the Dregs are even more greedy and possessive than the people in the Inner City," Wyntor said.
Albert hummed a bit. "I wouldn't say so."
Wyntor raised an eyebrow as he looked at Albert.
"I think they are more open with their desires than the people of the Inner City. It has a much greater impact when a friendly and nice person suddenly turns out to be a greedy asshole than when an asshole suddenly turns into a greedy asshole."
Wyntor blinked a couple of times.
"Strange metaphor," he stated.
"I mean, I think about the same number of people are selfish assholes in the Inner City than in the Dregs, but the selfish assholes that do exist are much easier to see in the Dregs, making it seem like there are more."
"Makes sense," Wyntor answered.
"However, there are also a lot of people like Nick," Albert added.
"In what way?"
"People that are unhappy with the world but lack the power to change it," Albert said. "Someone that still manages to retain humanity and empathy in a place where having these things is a luxury."
"There is no lack of bad people in this world, but in severe poverty, even the good people are forced to do bad things."
"Naturally, people with a lot of empathy can still see when someone doesn't want to hurt someone else but is forced to in order to survive. That's a tragedy in and of itself."
"If things were different, these people wouldn't be forced into a dark path, and many victims would have never become victims."
"Nick has such a belief," Albert said. "I know for a fact that he has already killed at least one person on purpose, but I also know that it will be very difficult for him to hurt someone who tries to hurt him but doesn't actually want to hurt him, if you get what I mean."
Wyntor raised an eyebrow in surprise. "Nick has killed someone?" he asked.
Nick seemed like a very nice and idealistic teenager to him.
Wyntor couldn't connect this nice teenager to a murder.
Albert nodded. "Nick managed to survive on his own in the Dregs for six years, and he even managed to build quite an impressive and athletic body. If you want such a body, you can't afford to lose two liters of blood per month."
"80% of the people in the Dregs can't pay their taxes every month. Even more, Nick managed to make the gangs his enemies, which would make it even more difficult for him to earn money."
"And yet, he always managed to do it."
"Even more, you can't overlook his enmity with the gangs. The gangs are organized and powerful. Killing a single man is not difficult at all for them."
"But for some reason, they are not willing to kill Nick, even though they don't like him."
"That can only mean that it isn't worth the price in their eyes, which means that they are certain that they will lose people to him, which, in turn, means they are certain that he can and will kill them."
"If the local rulers of the Dregs are sure that Nick has killed someone, I am inclined to believe them."
Wyntor just looked at the Containment Unit with a concerned expression.
Silence.
Eventually, Wyntor just sighed. "Pator said that you have something important to report," he said, changing the subject.
Albert grinned and took out a green flask, which he moved from side to side for a bit.
Wyntor just looked at the flask, not understanding what Albert was trying to convey.
"You don't get it?" Albert asked.
Wyntor looked at the bottle for a couple more seconds.
"Sorry, no, I don't," Wyntor said.
Albert just chuckled a bit. "I used that on the Dreamer about eleven hours ago."
At that moment, Wyntor's eyes shot open in shock.
"I'm not paying for that!" he immediately said.
"I know, I know," Albert said.
Wyntor still looked warily at Albert.
"Why would you use a grade four healing potion on a level one Specter?" Wyntor asked.
"I didn't use the entire thing," Albert said as he rubbed the back of his head. "I only used a drop."
"Also, because I got bored, and I wanted to teach Nick by actually showing him what to do instead of just telling him."
Wyntor's eyebrows rose in positive surprise. "Oh? So, can we earn money with the Dreamer now?"
Albert just grinned and pointed at the gauge of the Zephyx tank.
Wyntor looked at the gauge, and when he saw it, his eyes widened.
"Five grams?!" he shouted.
"Yep, five whole grams," Albert said with a laugh.
Wyntor looked at the Containment Unit with wonder.
"And I basically had nothing to do with it," Albert said before pointing at the edge of the Containment Unit. "It was all him."
Wyntor followed Albert's finger and looked over, and the next moment, Nick walked around the corner of the Containment Unit.
When Wyntor saw, he was taken aback by Nick's appearance.
Meanwhile, Albert just smiled. "Now, he looks just like a real Extractor."



Chapter 39 Card
Nick wore a red and black shirt with several pockets, and his pants were formfitting and black.
All in all, Nick looked quite sharp and competent.
It was quite difficult to connect the current Nick to a person from the Dregs.
He basically looked like all the other Zephyx Extractors, which was a good thing since almost all Zephyx Extractors exhibited this aura of authority, status, and power.
The only thing pulling down was his chaotic haircut.
"You look great!" Albert shouted with a thumbs-up.
Wyntor also nodded. "Please keep the uniform clean and wear it when you have to work. Every Zephyx Extractor only gets one set."
"How am I supposed to keep it clean?" Nick asked as he walked closer.
"You wash it," Albert said.
"With water?" Nick asked.
Meanwhile, Wyntor raised an eyebrow in confusion.
"Yes, with water," Albert said.
"But water is for drinking. Why would I waste a good barrel of water just to keep my clothing clean?" Nick asked like he had just heard the dumbest thing.
"Nick," Albert said with a deadpan voice. "You earned something like a thousand credits just now. A barrel of water doesn't even cost you five credits, and you can even wash your clothes several times with one."
"Albert," Wyntor said before Nick could answer. "Why wash it with water? I thought Extractor uniforms are made to be washed with Cleanser."
"The guy doesn't even want to waste water," Albert said, pointing at Nick with his thumb. "You want to try to convince him to use something a hundred times as expensive as water to wash his clothes?"
"Also, it doesn't really matter. When you get a cleansing shower in here, the problem will resolve itself anyway."
"Hm, I guess it makes sense," Wyntor said.
"What's a Cleanser and a cleansing shower?" Nick asked.
"The blue bath before you take the green bath," Wyntor answered. "That's filled with Cleanser. It's the blue liquid. A cleansing shower is a small room that pours Cleanser all over you. Every Manufacturer has a couple of those since some Specters can become stronger by coming into contact with matter from the outside."
"Since Cleanser isn't very expensive for Manufacturers due to their insane profits, they just force everyone that enters or exits a Containment Unit to take a cleansing shower beforehand as a precaution."
"We won't be any different since it's a negligible expense for an increase in security."
Nick nodded a couple of times. "Oh, okay. Sounds fancy."
"Anyway," Wyntor said as he walked closer to Nick with a smile. "I just saw the five grams of Zephyx you produced. That's a lot!"
Nick smiled brightly when he heard that. "Are we able to remain in operation indefinitely now?"
Wyntor furrowed his brows as he evaluated some things. "Kinda."
"Kinda?" Nick asked.
"Well, if we were to remain on this level, we could continue indefinitely, but that's not our goal, is it?"
Nick raised his eyebrows in unsure concern. "I guess not?"
"No, it isn't," Wyntor said with a firm tone. "The bare minimum we want to achieve is to earn 50 to 100 million credits so that I can buy a small part of Kugelblitz. If we were to operate in this manner indefinitely, that would take decades."
"We need more profit. We need to optimize Zephyx production with the Dreamer and expand our scope of operations."
"Catching Specters, containing Specters, employing people, paying rent, buying Containment Units, and so on all costs money, and one Dreamer just isn't enough to pay for all of this."
Nick raised an eyebrow in concern.
He understood that Wyntor wanted to become an heir to his family, but he also couldn't understand why someone would need that much money.
They were already earning a thousand credits per day.
Nick could literally do everything he wanted with that much money.
"Okay, we can do that," Nick said after a bit.
"Good," Wyntor answered with a smile. "Now, you've had a long day behind you, and I think you deserve a break."
"Naturally, I want to produce more money with the Dreamer, but I think it's important that you get a couple of days to yourself."
"Why don't you take the next three days off to recover?"
"Maybe go look around for some houses in the Outer City?"
"Maybe meet some friends?"
"Maybe go buy something?"
"In short, relax," Wyntor said, putting his hand on Nick's shoulder.
The next moment, Wyntor took out a small card and pushed it into Nick's hands.
Nick looked at the card and noticed that it looked very similar to the card that the guard had used to pay for Nick's bath.
"It's yours," Wyntor said.
Nick looked at the card with wonder.
"If you want to buy something, just hand it to the seller, but be careful which shops you frequent. Some of the sleazier shops might decide to exchange your card for a counterfeit."
Nick Just continued looking at the card. "How much is it worth?"
"10,000 credits. See it as a hiring bonus," Wyntor said.
Nick's eyes shot open.
10,000 credits!
What was he supposed to do with that much money?!
Nick reflexively tried to hand the card back to Wyntor, but Wyntor just shoved it back into Nick's hands.
"It's yours, Nick," Wyntor said. "You're my Chief Zephyx Extractor, and today, you made 5,000 credits for the company. Within two weeks, my and your personal wealth will increase by another 10,000 credits as long as you keep working diligently."
Nick looked with uncertainty at Wyntor and then looked at his card.
Yes, what Wyntor said made a lot of sense, but Nick still felt strange about just accepting 10,000 credits.
Logically, he knew that he would earn the company much more, but emotionally, he felt like he didn't deserve that much money.
"Well, it seems like everything's going well here," Albert said from behind them. "I think it's time for me to leave."
Wyntor turned to Albert and gave him a respectful handshake. "Thank you again for your help today."
"No problem," Albert said.
Then, Albert turned to Nick. "See you at some point, Nick."
Nick was taken out of his thoughts and looked at Albert. "Oh, yeah, thanks again, Albert! Without you, this wouldn't have been as easy."
"I know," Albert said with a smile. "See ya!"
Then, Albert walked out of the warehouse.
A couple minutes later, Nick also left the warehouse.
Wyntor had essentially thrown him out of the warehouse, telling him that he should relax for the next three days.
Nick just absentmindedly walked away from the warehouse.
He just kept looking at his card.



Chapter 40 Horua
Nick just aimlessly walked back to the Dregs with a disoriented expression.
10,000 credits.
Three days of nothing to do.
Nick had achieved his dream.
He had become a Zephyx Extractor.
He was earning a lot of money.
He didn't need to fear for his life anymore. Well, outside of being in the Dreamer's Containment Unit.
And yet, there was a certain emptiness in Nick's chest.
It was almost like all of this wasn't real.
Literally just two days ago, Nick had been poor and had spent all of his life in the Dregs.
Now, Nick was wearing nice clothes, and he had even taken a fancy bath.
Even more, he was rich.
Eventually, Nick just stopped walking.
By now, he had already reached the Dregs again, and he had stopped in the middle of a random road.
Nick just looked around the area.
He saw a couple of people, but they all avoided him.
None of them dared to look at him, and the few that had to travel past him either waited for him to leave or passed him with a wide berth.
There was fear and nervousness in their faces.
Nick felt the distance between him and the people around him widen.
In a way, Nick felt like he had been thrown out of his home.
Just a couple days ago, no one had batted an eye when he had been walking through the Dregs.
But now, everyone was looking at him from a distance with fear.
'I guess this is what happens,' he thought with a sigh. 'I look like a Zephyx Extractor now, and all Zephyx Extractors get such looks.'
'What am I saying? I don't look like a Zephyx Extractor. I AM a Zephyx Extractor!'
'This is what I have always dreamed of!'
Nick looked around the area with newfound motivation, but the more he looked at the people, the more isolated he felt.
Eventually, Nick sighed again before continuing to walk.
After a couple of minutes, Nick reached his goal.
In front of Nick was a sizable house made of rusty metal, but compared to most houses, this one was quite a lot bigger.
It was almost a mansion.
It was Nick's current home.
Nick opened the door and walked inside.
The house smelled just like the Dregs outside, but Nick didn't mind.
He was used to the smell of rust, shit, piss, and toxic waste.
"Nick?" came the voice of a young boy from upstairs.
A boy, about eleven years old, walked down the steps, but as soon as he saw the person standing at the entrance of the house, the boy stopped in shock.
"S-sir? How can I help y-you?" the boy asked with a fearful voice.
"It's me, Horua," Nick said.
"N-Nick?" Horua, the boy, asked in shock.
Horua was the actual owner of the big house.
Horua was the only child of a quite rich man in the Dregs, which meant that he was earning about as much as the average person in the Outer City.
He had only needed to save enough money to move out of the Dregs, but before he could do so, he vanished.
After some weeks, the gangs started to covet the man's old house and closed in on it.
Naturally, Horua couldn't resist them.
But then, Nick intervened, and he defended Horua.
However, while Nick was a nice person, he was also a practical one.
To say that Nick only helped the little boy out of the goodness of his heart would be a lie.
Nick saw Horua's troubles as a good way to earn some money without having to commit horrible acts.
In exchange for a place to live and his tax money, Nick made sure that no one dared to take anything from the house or hurt Horua.
For the past months, Nick had been living here.
"Is that really you?" Horua asked.
Nick nodded. "Yep," he said as a smile appeared on his face. "I'm officially a Zephyx Extractor now! Cool, huh?"
Horua looked with shock at Nick as he slowly walked closer.
For several seconds, Horua just looked at the uniform like it was a valuable gem.
"Wow," Horua eventually let out. "That's amazing!"
But then, the little boy realized something. "Wait, so does that mean that you won't be living here anymore?"
Nick furrowed his brows.
He didn't answer.
Nick had often thought about moving out of the Dregs, but when it finally became a reality, it felt like it had happened way too soon and quickly.
"I guess so," Nick said after a while.
Horua became a bit worried, and he looked at the ground.
With Nick gone, the gangs would return, and he would lose his house.
Even more, maybe the gangs would even take revenge on Horua for all the troubles Nick had caused them due to him!
Horua was just an eleven-year-old boy, and he was very scared of the gangs.
Horua felt like he would soon die.
But he also knew that Nick actually had no obligation to help him.
"And will happen to me?" Horua asked. "What about dad's house?"
Nick sighed.
"I don't know about the house, but I can make sure that the gangs won't hurt you. I can probably also store your credits somewhere."
Horua's eyes widened in fear.
He knew how much everyone coveted his father's money, and after becoming a Zephyx Extractor, Nick was suddenly willing to store Horua's money?
Horua became suspicious, but he still trusted Nick. After all, Nick had been protecting him for months.
For the next couple of minutes, Nick and Horua talked about what to do.
In the end, Horua could only sigh and accept that he wasn't strong enough to protect his own money.
"If I remain on my own, I will lose my money with certainty. If I trust you, there's still a chance," Horua said.
Nick wasn't offended that Horua didn't fully trust him. After all, they were both living in the Dregs.
"If only there were a way for me to also become a Zephyx Extractor and get an ability that makes me powerful."
When Nick heard that, he got an idea, and he scratched his chin in thought.



Chapter 41 Quest for Food
"I might have a way to help you, but it won't be easy," Nick said with a thoughtful expression.
Horua opened his eyes widely in surprise. "You do?" he asked.
Nick nodded. "I mean, I'm the Chief Zephyx Extractor in a company, and we still need to optimize the Zephyx production of one of our Specters."
"Horua, would you be interested in becoming a Zephyx Extractor?" Nick asked.
Horua's eyes opened even more, but this time, with wonder.
"Me? A Zephyx Extractor?"
Nick nodded with a smile. "Why not?"
"But I just turned eleven," Horua said with a bit of nervousness.
Nick just laughed. "So? Why not start early? Even more, it's not even difficult to work with that Specter. You basically just have to fall asleep in its presence! Additionally, since your Zephyx Synchronizer hasn't been attuned yet, you should also get a nice ability from it."
"As long as you don't die, nothing bad can happen."
Horua looked at Nick like he couldn't believe what he had just heard. "Are you sure? Can I really become a Zephyx Extractor?"
"Of course," Nick said with a chuckle. "You will gain an ability, a stable job, and lots of money. You might not earn as much as me, but you will still earn more than everyone in the Dregs."
Horua started to jump up and down in excitement. "Thank you! Thank you so much! You're the best, Nick!"
Nick just laughed some more. He always enjoyed it when Horua was excited.
Due to Horua's bad situation, he was rarely happy.
Whenever Nick wasn't present, Horua was worried and stressed. He even had trouble sleeping due to all the pressure.
"Anyway, I apparently have three days of vacation for now, which means I can't take you there right now, but after my vacation is over, I'll take you to your future workplace."
"You're going to see a real Specter, Horua," Nick said with a laugh.
"Wow, a real Specter," Horua echoed in wonder.
The two of them talked some more, but a couple of minutes later, Nick left the house again.
Earlier, Nick had felt aimless. He hadn't known what he should do with his newfound freedom.
But now, that problem had been solved.
Nick could use his position to help one of his friends out.
'It feels good to do good deeds.'
'Now, since the problem with Horua has been solved, I should take a look at some houses in the Outer City!' Nick thought with excitement.
But before long, Nick stopped.
Grumble.
'You know, I'm actually quite hungry. I think I haven't eaten anything in like a day or so,' Nick thought.
'What do I want to eat today?'
'Rat?'
'Fly?'
'Some veggie cubes from the market? I can now buy a lot of them with my money!'
'I could also go with rust mushroom, but I don't really want to. It tastes a bit too acidic for me.'
'Although, the house does have a ripe colony of rust mushrooms, and if I don't eat it soon, it will turn toxic and start releasing toxic spores.'
Nick scratched the back of his neck.
'I should just check out the market,' he thought with a shrug.
Nick changed direction and walked towards the market of the Dregs.
As soon as he arrived, most people turned to him.
Why was a Zephyx Extractor here?!
Nick tried his best to ignore the stares, but they still pulled his mood down a bit.
In the end, Nick entered one of the shops at the side of the market.
He had only gone into some of them due to a job, but he had never bought anything there.
The things in these shops were just too expensive.
The shop Nick had entered had many different pieces of food lying around.
There was rat, cat, dog, fly, and bird, and they even had several different kinds of veggie cubes!
The selection was amazing.
"H-How can I help you, sir?" the owner of the shop asked Nick as soon as he entered.
"Hey, I'm hungry. Do you have anything good to eat?" he asked.
The owner of the shop looked with confusion and suspicion at Nick. "Ye-yes, but I'm not sure if my wares have the quality your tongue desires, sir," he said with a bitter smile.
Nick just waved his hand to signal that it wasn't a big deal. "Just tell me what tastes good in here."
The owner of the shop became more nervous. "Well, I made a new cauldron of veggie cube soup. I'm not sure if sir is interested in veggie cubes, though. Sir is probably more familiar with real vegetables."
"Real vegetables?" Nick repeated with surprise. "Oh, right! I totally forgot that there are supposed to be real vegetables somewhere! Do you have any?"
The shop owner became more nervous.
This Zephyx Extractor was acting very strangely.
Was this some kind of scheme or technique to get some information out of the shop owner?
The Extractor's conduct made no sense.
Nevertheless, the shop owner had no chance but to go along with it.
"Sadly, no, sir," the shop owner said. "No one in the Dregs would buy them due to the price."
"Oh, okay," Nick said. "Then, give me some of that veggie cube soup."
"Of course, sir," the shop owner said as he quickly walked over to a cauldron.
The owner took the lid off, and Nick could smell the aroma.
It smelled absolutely amazing!
The next moment, the owner took out a bowl made of rusty metal and scooped some of the soup out of the cauldron.
"That will be ten credits, sir," the owner said nervously as he put the bowl down on the counter.
Ten credits were 10% of the monthly tax.
Only rich people in the Dregs could afford to eat something this luxurious.
The majority of the shop's customers probably came from the gangs.
Nick took out the card he had received from Wyntor and placed it on the counter.
When the shop owner saw the card, he smiled bitterly.
"Sir, we can't trade with bank cards in the Dregs."
"I'm not allowed to collect the outstanding balance from the banks since I am living in the Dregs."



Chapter 42 Sightseeing
Nick exited the shop with a bowl of veggie cube soup in his hands.
When Nick had canceled the order after realizing that he couldn't pay, the owner said that the bowl was on the house.
As a practical person, Nick saw no problem with that and simply accepted happily.
Nick also told the owner that he could ask Nick for help if there was anything he needed.
After leaving the marketplace quite quickly, Nick looked at the bowl of veggie cube soup in his hands with wonder.
In the Dregs, the people mostly ate meat.
Rat, cat, dog, insects, and so on.
However, it was also necessary to eat some veggie cubes every now and then.
Veggie cubes were green cubes made of different vegetables, which could no longer be sold in the Outer City.
When vegetables started to go bad, the shops sold them to one of the gangs, which then collected them all, threw them into some kind of furnace, and cooked them until there was zero water left in them.
One cube weighed about a hundred grams and cost a credit.
It was expensive!
Because of that, the people in the Dregs only ate them once a week or so.
If they didn't, they would start to show various signs of malnourishment.
The bowl of veggie cube soup was beige in color, and there was some kind of oily layer on top, which seemed to have separated from the soup.
The cubes had turned into slimy and mushy bits that swam in the beige broth.
Nick could also see a couple of mosquito larvae swimming in the broth.
These were not the larvae of normal mosquitos but the larvae of the mosquitos that belonged to the Specter, the Mosquito.
The mosquitos of the Specter continually reproduced, and apparently, the Specter didn't mind if anyone ate the larvae.
In fact, they mostly could be found in the Dregs, and they were very healthy.
But they were also expensive.
The larvae from these mosquitos were much bigger than the ones from normal mosquitos.
Each one was around five centimeters long!
When Nick saw the soup, he knew that he was holding something of extremely high class in his hands.
'No wonder this thing is so expensive!' Nick thought with wonder.
'It has four or five larvae and probably over 300 grams of veggie cubes!'
'That's enough food for two to three days!'
Nick slowly pushed the bowl to his mouth and drank the warm broth.
The fat had separated from the water, and the larvae had a bitter and metallic taste to them.
The distant taste of vegetables could also be slightly discerned.
Nick closed his eyes in bliss.
It was amazing.
He had never eaten anything this good in his entire life.
'Also, what is this strong taste? I can't put my finger on it?'
'Wait, is that rust lick?!'
In Nick's mind appeared the image of a big rock standing near the edge of the city.
That rock was made from a magical mineral that could treat some special conditions that caused dizziness, nausea, and vomiting.
The people just needed to lick the rock for a bit, and they would feel better.
Nick had heard some people refer to it as salt, but it was commonly known as rust lick since people licked it off a dirty stone.
'Putting rust lick into a soup. That's genius!' Nick thought.
'It tastes so amazing!'
Over the next hour, Nick slowly consumed the broth, and after he was done, he felt so incredibly good.
Nick felt like his body was telling him how happy it was.
'This is the life,' Nick thought in satisfaction. 'If I could eat this soup every day, I could die happy.'
A moment later, Nick yawned.
'Man, now I'm getting tired. Guess I should go back home and get some sleep.'
Nick stretched and turned to walk home.
After he arrived, Nick entered his room and fell onto his comfy plate of rust-free metal.
His entire body relaxed as he felt the comfortable embrace of sleep take him.
Several hours later, Nick woke up again, and this time, he felt awake and refreshed.
He slept amazingly!
After he woke up, he slowly scratched the back of his head in relaxation.
'Man, I feel great,' he thought with a yawn.
'So, what do I do today?'
After some time of thinking, Nick decided to look at the Outer City.
For the entire day, Nick went sightseeing in the Outer City, and he learned many things.
For example, he had learned how many different kinds of shops there were.
There were actually shops that sold expensive stones that had no other purpose but to look nice!
It was insanity!
Why would anyone pay money to carry a stone with them?
Nick had also learned that there were places where he could sleep without making them his home.
These places were called hotels.
Hotels didn't exist in the Dregs since there were more houses than people, but the same thing wasn't true for the Outer City.
After finding out about the hotels, Nick decided to rent a room for a couple of days and got Horua to come with him.
Nick didn't want to spend all his time alone, and he also wanted to have someone with him that he was familiar with.
Nick even visited several restaurants, but he didn't eat at any of them.
The prices were ridiculous for only a little bit of food!
Ten credits for 150 grams of meat?!
He could get that for free by just stomping on a couple of bugs!
The soup he had eaten the day before had weighed nearly a kilo, including the broth, and the ingredients had weighed over 400 grams!
Eventually, Nick got some physical credits from a bank, and he ate more of the veggie cube soup with Horua.
The day after that, Nick and Horua looked around the Outer City some more.
And finally, it was time to return to work!
It was time for Horua to work with the Dreamer!



Chapter 43 I Want
"It's great, isn't it?" Nick asked.
Horua just stood in front of the huge warehouse, his eyes filled with wonder.
A Zephyx Manufacturer!
He was in front of a Zephyx Manufacturer, and he was about to become an employee of one!
"Let's go in," Nick said with an encouraging smile.
Right now, it was early in the morning. Nick had decided to come during the afternoon because of Horua's sleep schedule.
It was better for Horua to sleep during the night, which was why they had arrived this early.
Working with the Dreamer might seem like rest, but it isn't actually rest.
Because of that, Nick wanted to get one session of work in before they went home to sleep.
The two of them entered the warehouse, and Horua looked at the huge wall of metal in front of him.
"Is that where it is?" he asked.
Nick nodded. "Yep. Sadly, I can't tell you any specifics without Wyntor."
Horua just nodded, showing that he understood.
A moment later, Horua noticed a tall man with light-brown hair sitting in front of a desk. Right now, there were many different sheets of paper on the desk, and the man was looking at them with furrowed brows.
"You're a bit early," Wyntor said with a smile, not looking up from the sheets of paper.
"Yep," Nick answered with a chuckle. "Also, I brought someone that I want to make into one of my Zephyx Extractors."
"Oh?" Wyntor said as he looked up from his papers.
Yet, when he saw the small boy, he furrowed his brows. "Are you talking about him?"
"Yep!" Nick said with a nod.
Nick pushed Horua forward a little bit, and Horua looked at Wyntor with respect and fear.
"Hello, sir, I want to become a Zephyx Extractor," Horua said, managing not to stutter.
Wyntor looked with an unsatisfied gaze at Horua.
"How old are you?"
"Eleven, sir," Horua said politely.
"Do you have any family?"
Horua was a bit surprised by the question, and even Nick raised an eyebrow in confusion.
"N-no, sir," Horua answered.
"I assume you are from the Dregs?" Wyntor asked.
Horua nodded. "Yes, sir."
"Are you a member of any organization or gang?"
"No, sir," Horua said.
"What's this all about?" Nick asked. "Why are you asking all of these questions."
"These questions have a purpose, Nick," Wyntor said without looking at him.
"Would anyone come searching for me if you died in here?" Wyntor asked.
This question made Horua quite nervous, and even Nick furrowed his brows.
However, Nick remained quiet.
"No, sir," Horua said with a bit of fear and sadness.
Wyntor continued looking at Horua with an unhappy expression.
"Nick, I need to speak with you privately," Wyntor said before standing up and walking behind the Containment Unit.
Nick looked suspicious and unhappy, but he just followed.
Horua was left alone in front of the Containment Unit.
"Nick, do you actually know what you're doing?" Wyntor asked with a raised eyebrow.
"Please elaborate," Nick said.
"He's a kid, Nick," Wyntor explained. "Just because you managed to withstand the Dreamer doesn't mean that everyone can. There are many cases of Extractors dying while working with a Specter that feeds on mentality when they actually shouldn't have."
"Too much stress can stop your heart or shut your brain down."
"I asked all these questions earlier because I wanted to make sure that no one would be searching for us in case the Dreamer killed him."
Nick furrowed his brows. "So, we can't employ him?" he asked.
"Technically, that's not my decision," Wyntor said.
"Not your decision?" Nick asked with a raised brow.
"I am the president and CEO. I don't deal with personnel issues unless they are directly related to me," Wyntor said. "You are the Chief Zephyx Extractor. It is your duty to build a team of capable Zephyx Extractors and assign the Specters to them."
"If you want to employ this boy, you are free to do so."
"However, if something happens, that's on you."
"If the Dreamer accidentally kills him, it is your fault, and you have to take responsibility and deal with the aftermath."
When Nick heard that, he felt his chest tighten.
Just now, the image of a dead Horua shot through his mind.
"I need to talk to him again," Nick said.
"Alright," Wyntor answered neutrally. "If you decide to employ him, tell me, and I will give you our standard contract."
"Does he know anything about the Dreamer or how we obtained it?"
Nick shook his head. "No."
For some reason, Wyntor's eyes seemed to show some relief.
"Good."
The next moment, the two of them walked to the front of the Containment Unit again.
Wyntor went back to his desk while Nick went over to Horua.
Horua looked with anxiety at Nick.
"Listen, Horua," Nick said. "I want you to know that becoming a Zephyx Extractor is not without its dangers."
"If you decide to become a Zephyx Extractor, you might undergo a short period of horrifying pain."
"The pain might become so bad that you could die."
Horua took a deep breath when he heard that.
"Your survival is not guaranteed, Horua," Nick said with a serious expression. "But if you manage to survive, you will become a Zephyx Extractor here."
"But you might also die."
"Are you sure you want to become a Zephyx Extractor here? It is not too late to turn around," Nick said solemnly.
Horua seemed quite worried as he looked at the ground.
Naturally, he was very scared.
"I will do it!" Horua said as he looked into Nick's eyes with desperation.
"There's nothing left for me in the Dregs."
"My parents are dead!"
"I've never had siblings!"
"I don't have a family!"
"I don't have friends except for you!"
"It's now or never!"
"Nick, I want to make something of my life!"
Nick kept looking at Horua with a serious expression.
"Are you sure?" he asked again.
"I am sure!" Horua answered. "I am strong, and I have a lot of willpower! I can deal with pain!"
Some seconds passed.
And then, Nick nodded.
"Wyntor, give me the contract."



Chapter 44 Horua and the Dreamer
Wyntor looked at Horua, sighed, and handed Nick two sheets of paper.
One of them was an NDA, which made sure that Horua wouldn't tell anyone about the company's secrets, and the other one was the employee contract.
Nick took the NDA and started to read it to Horua.
"Nick, you don't have to read it to me. I can read myself," Horua said.
Nick's eyes widened in surprise. "You can read?" he asked in shock.
Horua nodded. "Father taught me when I was young."
"Well, okay," Nick said as he handed the NDA over.
Horua read through everything in just a couple of minutes and nodded.
A moment later, he signed it.
"You have no questions?" Nick asked in surprise.
"I just can't tell anyone about anything specific, right?" Horua asked.
"Eh, yeah, sure. That's about it," Nick said.
Horua nodded and grabbed the actual contract.
After reading through it, Horua became shocked.
"I get to keep 10% of what I produce?!" he asked. "Isn't that a lot of money?"
Nick also looked at the contract since it was different from his own.
Sure enough, Horua got to keep 10% of what he produced.
This meant that he would get 500 credits per session with the Dreamer.
Nick asked Wyntor about the specific split of revenue.
"As the CEO and president, I get 20%," Wyntor said.
"10% go to you."
"10% go to the specific Extractor that produced everything."
"60% go to the company as funds."
Initially, Nick was a bit confused.
If Horua got 10% and Nick got 10%, then wouldn't Nick earn just as much as Horua?
Wasn't he the Chief Zephyx Extractor?
But then, Nick realized that he would get the money without actually doing anything.
And if he himself worked with the Dreamer, he would get just as much as Wyntor.
'So, if I get more Extractors, I get even more money. It's like other people are doing my work!'
However, Nick also wasn't super comfortable with that.
'I am essentially taking money from someone without doing anything. Isn't that like stealing? I mean, I didn't do anything.'
Nick looked at the Containment Unit.
'Although, I came up with the way to work with the Dreamer, and I was also the one that negotiated with it.'
'So, I guess, in a way, I actually did do something?' Nick thought with uncertainty.
'I dunno. I mean, okay, but it still feels a bit weird,' he thought as he scratched the back of his head awkwardly.
Eventually, Nick stopped thinking about all of the moral ramifications and just watched Horua sign the employee contract.
"Good," Nick said with a bright smile as he handed the signed contract to Wyntor, who wordlessly put it into a briefcase beside his chair.
"You're now officially one of my employees!" Nick said with a bright smile.
"Happy to meet you, boss!" Horua shouted with a bright voice as he performed a cute salute.
Nick put his hand on Horua's head and ruffled his hair a bit.
"Alright, then, let me tell you about what we do here and what your job will be."
Horua nodded and listened with excitement.
Over the next minutes, Nick told Horua everything he knew about the Dreamer.
"So, I just have to sleep beside it?" Horua asked in surprise.
Horua had thought that his work would be much more difficult than just sleeping.
"Yep," Nick said with a smirk. "The Dreamer will even help you fall asleep!"
"Although, you still have to be careful! After all, it is a Specter."
Horua blinked. "Nick, what am I supposed to do if it decides to attack me?"
Nick didn't answer for a while.
Right, what was Horua supposed to do?
Even Nick could die if the Dreamer decided to attack.
What could the little Horua do?
"Eh, it probably won't happen," Nick said with a nervous chuckle. "It knows exactly that it can't just kill you. It wouldn't be in its best interest."
Horua looked worried again.
"Anyway, I think I should introduce you," Nick said as he walked towards the Containment Unit.
"To whom?" Horua asked.
"Whom?" Nick asked. "You mean who, right?"
"No, it's whom," Horua answered. "To whom will you introduce me to."
"What, why? What even is whom?" Nick asked.
"I don't know, but my father always corrected me," Horua said. "Anyway, to whom?"
"The Dreamer," Nick said.
"Wait, what?! Now?!" Horua asked nervously.
Nick nodded. "Yep."
Horua looked around nervously, but he eventually followed Nick. "Well, you're the boss."
Nick nodded and opened the employee door to the Containment Unit.
A couple seconds later, Nick and Horua entered the Containment Unit.
Horua was standing a bit behind Nick, but as he looked past Nick's torso, he could see the Dreamer.
The black owl was standing in the corner of the room, looking into Nick's eyes.
Nick had narrowed his eyes and was looking back at the Dreamer.
A bit later, the Dreamer turned its head and looked at Horua.
When Horua saw the Dreamer look at him, a cold shudder of terror shook his body.
These eyes!
For some reason, Horua felt like he was about to die!
This thing was dangerous!
He had to leave!
He had to run!
Nick noticed Horua's reaction and grabbed his arm before he could run away.
Horua just kept looking at the Dreamer as his body leaned back, ready to run away as soon as he could.
The Dreamer didn't show any reaction.
"Horua!" Nick shouted aggressively.
Horua's body shook, and his terrified eyes looked at Nick.
"You are now a Zephyx Extractor! You have to be brave and meet the danger head-on!"
Horua took a deep breath and tried to calm down.
However, when he looked at the Dreamer again, his fear exploded once more, and he tried to pull himself out of Nick's grip.
"Horua, what's going on with- Argh!"
Nick's question was interrupted by Horua biting Nick's hand.
Naturally, Nick let go of Horua, and Horua ran out of the Containment Unit in terror.
Nick furrowed his brows and looked at his slightly bleeding hand.
'What the hell is wrong with him?' Nick thought.
Nick looked at the Dreamer.
The Dreamer looked back.
"I'll be back soon."
Then, Nick walked out of the Containment Unit.



Chapter 45 Liability
Nick left the Containment Unit and saw Horua trying to open the door of the warehouse.
"Horua!" Nick shouted with anger as he ran over.
When Horua heard Nick's angry voice, his entire body shuddered before freezing.
Nick quickly arrived behind Horua and forcefully turned him around to face him.
Horua looked into Nick's eyes with terror.
"What's wrong with you?!" Nick shouted.
"I-I-I," Horua stuttered. "N-No. No! I can't!"
"Horua!" Nick shouted again. "Get a grip! It's just the Dreamer! It didn't even do anything! It just looked at you!"
The Dreamer's dead eyes shot through Horua's mind again, and his body shuddered.
"Horua!" Nick shouted again.
Horua was forcefully pulled out of his terror by Nick's shout. "Nick, I changed my mind! I don't want to be a Zephyx Extractor anymore! I want to go home!"
Nick looked with shock at Horua. "What? Why? You said you were willing to face the danger head-on! You said you have willpower and want a chance to make something of your life."
Horua just shook his head wildly. "No, I can't! I will die! I can feel it! I will die!"
"I don't want to see this monster again!"
"It will kill me, Nick!"
"I can feel it!"
"It will kill me!"
"Horua!" Nick shouted again as he shook Horua's little body a little. "Calm down! You have to calm down!"
Surprisingly, shouting at Horua to calm down actually seemed to work, and Horua took a couple of deep breaths.
"Nick, I can't go back in there! I will die! I know it! I feel it!" Horua pleaded.
Nick looked with furrowed brows at Horua.
"Come on, Horua," Nick said with a calmer voice. "It's just a big owl. You will go to sleep, have a little nightmare, and you will wake up rich."
"Even more, you also get an ability since your Zephyx Synchronizer will get attuned to the Dreamer," Nick explained.
"Just one little session with the Dreamer would forever change your life for the positive! Don't throw this opportunity away!"
Horua didn't immediately answer, and he just looked at the ground in front of him.
Silence.
As the seconds passed, Horua's breathing quickened, and his body began to shudder again.
"No!" Horua said with conviction as he looked into Nick's eyes. "I'm not going back in there!"
Nick looked at Horua with a concerned expression. "Are you sure?"
"Yes, I'm sure!" Horua shouted.
The next moment, Horua looked back at the ground.
"Can't we just go back home, Nick?"
Nick took a deep breath.
"I have to talk to Wyntor," Nick said.
"Thank you," Horua said quietly as he only looked at the ground in fear and shame.
Even though Horua felt fearful, he also felt like he had disappointed Nick.
Horua wanted to face the Dreamer, but whenever he thought of the Dreamer's eyes, his body and soul refused to interact with it in any way.
Nick walked over to Wyntor and sighed. "Sorry, but Horua resigns."
Wyntor put the sheets of paper down and looked at Nick with a serious expression.
"The kid is a liability," Wyntor said.
Nick sighed. "I know. Sorry for wasting your time. I've always seen how brave he was, and I thought that he could work with the Dreamer. After all, the Dreamer is basically just a big owl."
Wyntor wordlessly looked into Nick's eyes with an emotionless expression.
"I thought he could handle it," Nick added. "But in the end, he is just a child."
Nick sighed. "I should have known."
"This is my fault."
"Sorry."
Wyntor kept looking at Nick.
A couple of seconds of silence passed, and Nick became a bit uncomfortable under Wyntor's emotionless gaze.
"I think you didn't understand what I meant, Nick," Wyntor said.
Nick looked with a bit of confusion and worry at Wyntor.
"What do you mean?" he asked.
"Nick, why do you think I asked the boy about his family, friends, and social circle?" Wyntor asked.
Nick's heart rate increased, but he didn't say anything.
"Because of you," Wyntor explained. "If things went sour, I want the consequences to be as little and unimportant as possible."
"I have no issues with letting an experienced Extractor resign. They have experience and are an adult. They know what it means to break an NDA."
"But he's just a kid. You saw what happened when he saw the Dreamer."
"Kids don't know what they feel or think most of the time. They don't have enough experience to evaluate themselves objectively."
"You saw how motivated and excited he was when he told you that he would change his life and work with the Dreamer, but as soon as he met him, he ran away in fear."
"The same might happen with the NDA."
"Of course, the punishment for breaking the NDA is death, but the boy isn't an adult yet. He might believe that he will get away with it as long as he makes the other person promise that they won't tell anyone else."
"At that point, the damage is already done."
Nick's chest tightened in anxiety, but he did his best to seem calm.
"So, what's your plan?" Nick asked. "How can we solve this issue?"
Wyntor wordlessly looked into Nick's eyes again for a while.
Nick's heart rate increased even more.
"How about making him sign another contract?" Nick asked. "One that makes it even more difficult to break the NDA."
"What about sending Pator to keep an eye on Horua? I will even pay for it with my own money!"
"What if I just continue living with him until he becomes ready to face the Dreamer for real?"
Wyntor didn't answer.
He just kept looking at Nick emotionlessly.
"Nick, the boy is a liability."
"His continued existence is a danger to the company."
"There are only two ways this will go."
"One, he does not leave this warehouse and becomes an official Zephyx Extractor by working with the Dreamer."
"Two, I will make Pator escort him home, and on the way home…"
"The boy will accidentally fall through the grates in the Dregs."
"But he will be dead before he hits the water."
"I will not put my company in the hands of an eleven-year-old child's ability to keep a secret."



Chapter 46 Responsibility
Nick's mind nearly stopped.
Horua would get killed?!
What?!
"Tell me you're joking," Nick said evenly.
"I'm not joking," Wyntor said.
"Are you insane?!" Nick shouted.
In the distance, Horua heard Nick and became anxious again.
"No, I'm not insane," Wyntor said calmly but forcefully. "I am doing the best thing for the company."
"It is my job to make this company flourish and profitable."
"In fact, dealing with these things isn't even directly my job."
"It's yours."
"The fact that I am willing to send Pator to deal with the issue is a favor to you."
"It's me being lenient because you don't know how Zephyx Manufacturers and the world of business work."
Nick gritted his teeth. "You're willing to just fucking kill a kid?!"
"Now, he's a kid?" Wyntor asked with annoyance. "Earlier, you hired him like he was a proper adult."
"You treated him like an adult. So, he has to take responsibility for his actions like an adult."
"He fulfills his contract or bears the consequences," Wyntor said.
"He's fucking eleven, Wyntor!" Nick almost shouted. "You are willing to kill an eleven-year-old kid for your business?!"
"Our business, Nick," Wyntor said. "Also, you are not much better. You were willing to make a kid work with a Specter, the natural enemy of humanity and the most dangerous existence in the world."
"I warned you!" Wyntor shouted slightly. "I told you that this is your responsibility! But as soon as anything goes wrong, you don't have the maturity to deal with it!"
"I'm the one that has to deal with this issue now!"
"Because you were unable to do your job properly, I now have to give the order to kill a kid!"
"Do you think this is easy for me?!"
"Do you think I'm some kind of cold machine that can't feel anything?!"
"I don't want to fucking kill the kid as well, but I fucking have to!"
"If I don't, everything I have sacrificed for this business will be for nothing!"
"Even more, how do you think Pator will feel?!"
"Pator has been trained to deal with these things, but he has never killed a mere kid before!"
"This will also mess him up for a long time!"
"Because you can't deal with your own mistakes, two other people have to suffer!"
"Your stupidity, indecisiveness, and mental weakness are why Pator and I have to go through shit now!"
"Even more, if you had simply decided against hiring him after I warned you, he also wouldn't need to die!" Wyntor shouted.
"Then why didn't you stop me?!" Nick shouted back.
"Because it's your responsibility!" Wyntor said with an aggressive tone.
"You are my Chief Zephyx Extractor! You are a leader! You are a manager!"
"This is the difference between a Zephyx Extractor and a Chief Zephyx Extractor!"
"Responsibility!"
"If an Extractor dies, it's your fault!"
"Your processes were not good enough, or you chose the wrong person, or you have forced someone to work at the wrong time!"
"If something happens to an Extractor or a Specter, you are always, at least, partially responsible!"
"You make the decisions!"
"You have all the freedom!"
"But if something goes wrong, it's on you!"
Nick gritted his teeth.
He acknowledged that what Wyntor said made sense and that he was right…
But Horua was just a child!
No matter how responsible Nick felt, it simply felt wrong to kill a child!
Nick clenched his fists with all of his power, the pain making it a bit easier to think.
"Deal with the issue," Wyntor commanded as he sat down again.
"If you need Pator to take action, tell me."
"I gave you this position because I felt like I could trust you and because I felt like you have the talent and mentality for it."
"Don't betray my trust in you," Wyntor said.
Nick didn't answer and just gnashed his teeth as he gazed fixedly at the desk.
At this moment, Nick was overwhelmed by a tsunami of rage, frustration, guilt, fear, uncertainty, and helplessness.
'I was the one that hired him,' Nick thought with pain.
'I was the one that made the decision.'
'However…' Nick thought as he looked at Wyntor again.
"Wyntor," Nick slowly said.
Wyntor didn't answer.
"Yes, it is my responsibility," Nick said. "However, why didn't you tell me what would happen if Horua decided to resign?"
"I know you didn't need to, but I feel like this could have been avoided if you had just told me."
Wyntor didn't answer for several seconds.
"I needed you to learn," Wyntor said.
"I had to show you what kind of power you have, and I needed to show you what would happen if you used it irresponsibly."
"Right now, the company is still new, and our survival is not yet intrinsically connected to the success."
"If anything goes wrong now, I can still rectify it."
After that, Wyntor turned silent.
Nick took a deep breath.
'In the end, it's my fault,' Nick thought.
'I should have known that Horua wasn't able to make such a big choice.'
'I should have never told him that he would become a Zephyx Extractor.'
Nick took another deep breath as he turned to look at the distant Horua.
The next moment, Nick gritted his teeth and narrowed his eyes.
'And it is my responsibility to deal with the issue.'
'I'm so sorry, Horua!'
Nick walked over to Horua.
When Horua saw Nick's expression, he became terrified and froze.
Nick grabbed Horua's arm and pulled him towards the Containment Unit.
Horua's face immediately turned white, and his body began to shake.
"No!"
"No, Nick!"
"What are you doing!"
Nick gritted his teeth more.
"I'm sorry, Horua, but you have to work with the Dreamer!" Nick said with a dark tone.
"No! No! Nick, I don't want to! Please!" Horua screamed as he tried his best to free himself from Nick's grip.
"I'm sorry," Nick repeated. "I also don't want to do this."
"But I'm only doing this for your own good!"
"You can hate me if you want, but right now, I need you to work with the Dreamer!"
"No! Please! No!" Horua shouted as he started to bite Nick's hand.
Nick began to bleed, but he just kept pulling Horua.
Nick opened the door to the Dreamer.
And when it opened fully, Nick pushed Horua in before walking in himself.
The next second, the door closed behind him.



Chapter 47 Bad Guy
"No! Nick! I'm sorry! Please, let me go!" Horua shouted in panic as he tried to get past Nick.
Nick just shoved Horua forward, making him fall on his ass.
"This is for your own good, Horua," Nick said with a serious tone. "You have to work with the Dreamer! You have to!"
Horua could feel the dead eyes of the Dreamer on his back, causing his mind to spiral further into panic.
"I can't! No!" Horua shouted as he tried to leave again.
Nick gritted his teeth and pushed Horua away again.
"I don't want to do this either, but you have to!" Nick said.
"Why?! Why do I have to?!" Horua asked in a mix of betrayal, rage, and terror. "What did I ever do to you?! I thought we were friends!"
Nick didn't immediately answer.
'I can't tell Horua that Wyntor would have killed him if he left. If he knows, he will become enraged and do something stupid! He might try to cause Wyntor as much damage as possible, which would be spreading all secrets that Horua knows.'
'I can't let him do that!'
'Not because it will hurt Wyntor but because it will mean that Horua will die.'
'Horua is a kid, and it's my fault that I didn't see that sooner!'
'If he gets too angry, all of this suffering will be for nothing, and he will die anyway!'
'I can't allow Horua to die!'
'And for that, I have to be the bad guy.'
'It's my responsibility anyway. It's only right that I also pay the price.'
"This is for your future, Horua!" Nick shouted. "You do not know how lucky you have been in the Dregs until now!"
"If you don't take the plunge now, you will forever remain in the Dregs!"
"You're lying!" Horua shouted back. "You were willing to let me go, but then, you talked to that other guy!"
"And now, you're suddenly forcing me to do this!"
"It's him, isn't it?! He's the one that forces you to force me!"
Nick grew more anxious and gritted his teeth even more.
BANG!
Horua felt like the world was turning.
The next moment, he felt himself hitting the ground.
Horua's world spun, and it took a while for him to think clearly again.
That's when he saw it.
Blood.
Teeth.
Nick had backhanded Horua, breaking three of his teeth in the process.
Luckily, the three teeth were still baby teeth, which meant that the real teeth were still there.
Yet, Horua still felt an incredible amount of pain at this moment.
But stronger than the pain was the shock.
Nick had hit him.
Nick had never hit him before.
Even more, this wasn't just an innocent slap.
No, this was a strong backhand that caused Horua to bleed.
"You will thank me later," Nick coldly said.
Yet, contrary to how Nick appeared on the outside, he actually felt absolutely disgusted with what he was saying and portraying.
'Thank me later? As if!' Nick thought with gritted teeth. 'If I were him, I would hate me for the rest of my life!'
'I'm not his family, and I've only been his friend for a couple of months.'
'I have no right to force him to do any of this.'
Nick took a deep breath, but he made it seem like he was breathing in deeply out of frustration and anger.
'I'm so sorry, Horua.'
Nick slowly walked forward.
BANG!
And Nick kicked Horua towards the middle of the Containment Unit.
'I'm sorry.'
Horua rolled into the middle of the Containment Unit as he looked with pure shock at Nick.
It was like Nick had transformed into someone he had never seen before.
'Is this who he really is?' Horua thought in fear, shock, and betrayal.
'Was everything else just an act?'
'Did he just want me to sign the contract so that he can force me to do things?'
'Is this who you really are?'
Yet, Horua didn't say anything.
Silence.
"Go work with the Dreamer," Nick said coldly. "I will stay here until you're done."
At that moment, Horua remembered that he was in the Containment Unit of the Dreamer and slowly turned around.
Just two meters behind Horua was the Dreamer.
It hadn't moved until now, and it was still looking at Horua with its dead eyes.
Horua's mind froze.
His heart rate shot past 200 beats per minute, and his world began to swim.
Horua started to breathe very rapidly, which only increased his dizziness.
And then, he fell over.
Horua had lost consciousness due to his overwhelming shock and fear.
When the Dreamer saw that, it slowly turned to look at Nick.
"He will be working with us from now on," Nick said slowly.
"You are allowed to feed off him for the next eight hours, and if he survives, he will continue to work with you."
"If he doesn't, I will be the only one working with you from now on."
"If everything goes well, I will also search for a third person to work with you."
"Don't do anything stupid," Nick said coldly.
The Dreamer slowly turned to look at Horua again.
Then, it slowly walked towards Horua's head.
And it stopped.
The Dreamer simply stood beside Horua's head and looked fixedly at his closed eyes.
A moment later, Horua's eyelids twitched, but at that moment, Nick noticed that the Prephyx in the Containment Unit increased.
Nick only hoped that this increase didn't mean that the Dreamer wanted to attack.
Luckily, the increase of the Prephyx didn't sound the alarm, and Horua's eyelids calmed down two seconds later.
Horua's breathing changed, and his body involuntarily moved into a more comfortable position.
He was asleep.
When Nick saw that, he sighed and sat down in front of the door.
For a while, Nick just took some shaky breaths, and he slowly put his head in his hands.
The Dreamer started to feed.
The Zephyx container was being filled.
Yet, Nick wasn't happy.
Not even one bit.



Chapter 48 Contemplation
In the Containment Unit, Nick simply sat on the ground, unmoving.
He didn't say anything.
'I'm so sorry, Horua.'
Nick didn't move.
'I'm sorry!'
'I should have known that things wouldn't be so easy!'
'Even though the Dreamer is not very scary for a Specter, it is still a Specter!'
'And you're a kid!'
'How could I ever think that a child would be able to work with a Specter?!'
'I'm stupid!'
'I'm fucking retarded!'
'I'm so sorry!'
'I was the one that fucked up, and now you have to pay the price!'
'This is all my fault, Horua!'
Nick's limbs shook in frustration, guilt, and rage.
'I feel so horrible.'
'Please, Horua, when you wake up, don't do anything stupid.'
'You can hate me.'
'You can ignore me.'
'You can try to ruin me.'
'I'm fine with everything.'
'But please, don't try to ruin the business or Wyntor.'
'Because if you do that, you will die!'
As Nick continued to think about everything, his own reality also finally set in.
'Actually, I think I'm in a similar position to Horua.'
'Wyntor made me his Chief Zephyx Extractor.'
'If I were to betray him, I would also be killed off.'
Nick's fists clenched.
'Wyntor is a cold and calculating businessman. He eliminates everyone that goes against him.'
'If I were to tell anyone anything confidential, I would be dead within the day.'
Slowly, rage and fear also joined Nick's emotions.
'Wyntor!'
'I know that this is my responsibility, but you knew that this would happen!'
'You might have even wanted this to happen!'
'After all, you said that you wanted me to learn!'
Nick gritted his teeth in anger.
But then, a scene appeared in Nick's mind.
The scene depicted Wyntor standing behind Nick as he blinded the Dreamer.
In that scene, Wyntor was completely drenched in sewer water.
Nick remembered how difficult it had been for Wyntor to jump in, and he also remembered how much Wyntor had suffered after he had left the sewer again.
'He only did that because he wanted to catch the Dreamer!' Nick thought with hatred.
Yet, the more time passed, the more Nick felt like he didn't truly believe that.
Did Wyntor truly only do this because of the Dreamer?
'Actually, probably not.'
'It wasn't certain that I would die.'
'There was a good chance that I would manage to swim towards the entrance of the sewers, where Wyntor was standing.'
'Then, Wyntor would have been able to help me without jumping into the sewers.'
There had been a good thirty meters between the place where Nick had been and the entrance of the sewers.
For Wyntor to swim that far, he must have jumped into the sewers nearly half a minute before he had arrived at Nick's side.
Nick put his hands on his knees and violently grabbed them in frustration.
'He's not cold,' Nick thought.
'He might appear cold now, but people only show their true faces when they are in a stressful or dangerous situation.'
'When it was important, Wyntor was willing to jump into the sewers to save me. It might have also been in his own best interest, but it still must have been very difficult.'
'Right now, he's only cold because he needs to be.'
'This is his job.'
'Like he said, deciding to kill Horua probably also heavily weighs on his mind.'
'And yet, he still talked normally with me, and he didn't say anything out of line.'
'I fucked up, and Wyntor has to suffer because of it.'
'But he only reprimanded me.'
'Horua suffers because of me.'
'Wyntor suffers because of me.'
'If things go badly, even Pator will suffer because of me.'
'I was the one that made the decision to get Horua.'
'Wyntor warned me, but I didn't listen.'
'This is all because of me.'
At this moment, most of Nick's emotions vanished, replaced by only two emotions.
Guilt and determination.
'This is my fault.'
'And it is my job to rectify these issues.'
'No matter what I have to do or what it will cost!'
Nick looked forward again.
The Dreamer was still standing beside the sleeping Horua.
At this moment, Horua looked like he was peacefully sleeping.
'It's not that bad, Horua. You will just have some bad dreams and wake up.'
'It won't be as bad as you imagined it to be.'
'And when you wake up, you will officially be a Zephyx Extractor.'
'You will have an actual future, and you will gain powerful abilities.'
'I know things will only improve for you.'
'Sadly, I won't be part of that future.'
'I know you hate me.'
Nick took a shaky breath.
'And I'm fine with it.'
'That's the price I must pay.'
'I don't deserve forgiveness for what I've done.'
Nick just continued looking at Horua.
The memories of what Nick had done to Horua became hazier and hazier.
It was almost like all of this hadn't happened.
It was like nothing had changed.
Yet, whenever Nick looked at Horua and the Dreamer, he was reminded of reality.
It had happened.
But it didn't feel like it had happened.
After a while, Nick put his head in his hands again.
Silence.
Nick didn't move.
Time passed.
Nick had plenty of time and opportunity to think about what he had done.
In this Containment Unit, there was nothing for Nick to do.
And he had to remain here for eight hours.
Paradoxically, it felt like the longest and the shortest eight hours of Nick's life.
On one hand, Nick felt like time was dragging on forever, but on the other hand, Nick despaired at the rapid passage of time.
He didn't want to see how Horua would react when he woke up.
It was torture.
However, it wouldn't be eight hours until things changed.
After just five hours, something happened.
Crk! Crk!
Nick heard something and looked over.
He saw the Dreamer take a couple of steps back as it retreated back into its corner.
For just a moment, Nick was confused.
But the next moment, Horua's body suddenly started to shake violently.
Nick's eyes widened.
'He's having a seizure!'



Chapter 49 Worry
When Nick saw the seizure, he realized why the Dreamer had retreated.
The Dreamer was showing that it wasn't trying to kill Horua!
It was just that Horua wasn't strong enough to resist whatever the Dreamer was showing him.
When he had still been here, Albert had told Nick about some potential dangers.
Albert had said that working with the Dreamer could be dangerous, but it shouldn't be.
Since the Dreamer was only feeding on mentality, actual injuries were not a thing, and since everyone would forget the dreams they had, mental problems also shouldn't be a thing.
The only dangerous part was during the dreams.
If someone was pushed too far in a dream, their mind might actually shut down.
At that point, their bodily functions might stop working.
'But Albert said that it would be difficult to notice someone dying like that!' Nick thought. 'He said that they would die quietly!'
'Yet, Horua is definitely not dying quietly!'
'That means I still have a chance to save him!'
Nick shot to his feet and jumped to Horua's side.
The Dreamer just looked at Nick from its corner with its dead eyes.
Horua started to froth at the mouth, and his body was making sounds as it slapped against the ground.
"Horua!" Nick shouted as he lightly slapped his cheeks.
Nick had seen seizures in the Dregs, but he had no idea how to deal with them.
What was he supposed to do?!
Was he supposed to keep him steady so that he didn't injure himself?
Was he supposed to slap him awake?
"Horua, hold on!" Nick shouted in fear. "You're still alive!"
"Horua, you're awake!"
"It was all a dream, Horua!"
"Please!"
But Horua just continued seizing.
The next moment, a disgusting greenish-brown liquid appeared in Horua's throat.
'Puke?' Nick thought.
Nick watched as the puke bubbled in Horua's throat.
At the same time, Nick heard the sound of Horua desperately trying to breathe.
'He's asphyxiating on his puke!'
Nick immediately grabbed Horua and lifted him up by his legs.
Then, Nick began to shake Horua to get all the puke to come out.
The puke was leaving Horua's mouth and nose.
"Please, Horua!"
"Wake up!"
Nick was in a panic as he put Horua down again.
The shaking had gotten weaker.
Nick just hoped that this was a sign of recovery, not death.
After some seconds, Horua's half-closed eyes just quietly looked at the ceiling of the Containment Unit.
They didn't move.
Nick looked with terror at Horua.
'Please be alive! Please be alive! Please be alive!' Nick repeated in his mind.
"Horua! Horua, are you okay?" Nick asked with a worried voice as he lightly tapped Horua's cheek.
"Please, don't die!"
"Please!"
Nick just looked at Horua.
Horua didn't do anything for several seconds.
Slowly, Nick moved forward and put his head on Horua's chest.
'His heart is still beating,' Nick thought with relief.
The next moment, Nick held his hand in front of Horua's mouth.
'He's also breathing.'
Nick released a sigh of relief.
'He's still alive!'
At this moment, Nick's taught emotions finally relaxed, but he still felt a bit nervous about Horua's state.
Nick gently lifted Horua and left the Containment Unit.
The Dreamer was just watching Nick silently.
When Nick went out of the Containment Unit, he saw Wyntor looking up from his desk and walking over.
When Wyntor saw the limp Horua, he knew that something must have gone wrong.
"What happened?" Wyntor asked.
Nick took a deep breath and related everything that had happened to Wyntor.
Wyntor's expression became darker the more he heard.
"It sounds like he has suffered severe mental damage," Wyntor said.
"What will happen to him?" Nick asked.
"We don't know," Wyntor said.
"You don't know?" Nick asked with an anxious voice.
"Everyone reacts differently to severe mental stress," Wyntor added. "My teacher only went over a couple of outcomes back then."
"However, one thing is certain."
"He needs to see a doctor," Wyntor explained.
"Then, let's go to one!" Nick said urgently.
Wyntor put his hand on Nick's shoulder, stopping him from leaving. "Nick, calm down!"
"Wyntor, I need-"
"Calm down!" Wyntor shouted.
Nick took a deep breath.
"Yes, what?" he asked.
"Nick, we are not going out to get a doctor."
"The doctors come to us."
First, Nick wanted to shout in aggression, but then, his eyes widened.
"They come to us?" he asked.
Wyntor nodded.
"Pator!" Wyntor shouted.
"Coming!" Pator shouted from a distant spot where he was cleaning the floor.
"Yes, sir?" Pator asked.
"Get a physician from the closest clinic to come here," Wyntor ordered. "This boy has received heavy mental damage from a Specter."
When Pator heard that, he took in a deep breath.
He looked at Horua in shock and then looked at Wyntor.
Pator was amazing at keeping a poker face, but Wyntor had still noticed that Pator's expression had become colder as he looked at Wyntor.
"Of course, sir," Pator said before dashing out of the warehouse.
Wyntor turned to Nick. "Put him to the side," he said as he pointed to one of the walls.
Nick nodded. "Thank you, Wyntor," he said quietly as he walked to one of the walls with Horua.
Wyntor just sighed. 'What's there to thank for?'
Nick didn't put Horua down but simply sat down with him still in his arms.
Several minutes passed before Pator returned with someone.
It was a relatively young woman with green hair who was wearing a white coat.
Pator led the woman to Nick.
When Nick saw her, his breathing quickened.
He hoped Horua was okay.
"Please, help him," Nick said in fear.
The doctor looked at Horua, and her eyes became visibly cold and distant.
Such a young boy.
She was disgusted by this company.
After all, how could a child enter a Containment Unit on their own?
Yet, the expression of the man in front of her spoke of genuine worry and fear.
This told the doctor basically what had happened.
Stupidity had happened.
"Put him down," she commanded coldly.



Chapter 50 Diagnosis
Nick quickly put Horua down and stepped back.
Right now, Nick only hoped that Horua would survive.
The doctor took out a small bag with different medical equipment and slowly took out some kind of tool that she put on Horua's chest.
Half a minute later, she put the tool away again and put some other tool around Horua's arm for a while.
After that, she used a light to look into Horua's vacant eyes.
The more time passed, the stronger her frown became.
"What's his name?" she asked.
"Horua," Nick answered.
"Horua, can you hear me?" she asked in a friendly manner as she looked into Horua's eyes.
Horua didn't answer.
A moment later, she shined her light into Horua's eyes again.
"I know you're awake, Horua," she said. "Your pupils are constricting when I shine my light into them. That only happens when you are conscious."
Horua didn't do anything.
For several minutes, the doctor kept talking to Horua as she touched different parts of his body.
Yet, Horua never showed any reaction.
A bit later, the doctor actually slowly lifted Horua's arm and let go.
Nick's eyes widened when he saw that the arm didn't fall.
The arm actually remained in the air!
"Horua?!" Nick asked with hope.
However, the doctor just furrowed her brows.
The next moment, she snapped her fingers a couple of times in front of Horua's face, and she even acted like she was about to snip Horua's eyes.
No reaction.
Eventually, she only sighed and slowly lifted Horua into a sitting position and leaned him against the wall.
"I need to talk to the two of you," the doctor said as she stood up.
Nick knew that she was referring to Wyntor and him.
"Of course," Nick said.
Nick walked over to Wyntor, and the doctor followed him.
Wyntor looked at the doctor with a neutral expression. "What's the diagnosis?"
"First, I need to know what happened," the doctor answered. "I know that Zephyx Manufacturers are very secretive, which is why I only need a rough explanation."
Wyntor nodded. "Of course."
"Wait," Nick said, interrupting Wyntor.
The two of them looked at Nick.
"I will tell her," Nick said with a deep breath. "After all, all of this is my fault."
Wyntor looked at Nick for a bit but nodded.
Then, Nick told the doctor about his idea to make Horua a Zephyx Extractor so that he would have a future outside of the Dregs.
The doctor was disgusted by Nick, but she kept a professional demeanor.
'At least he feels guilty,' she thought with a snort.
When it came to the Dreamer, Nick only said that Horua had a nightmare.
"A nightmare?" the doctor asked. "A nightmare or the Nightmare?"
"A nightmare," Nick answered. "You know, a bad dream."
The doctor frowned and became quiet.
"That explains some things," she said. "With all of this information, I can be more certain in my diagnosis."
Nick and even Wyntor listened intently.
"The boy, Horua, is awake currently," the doctor explained. "His reflexes and autonomous bodily functions are working fine. This means he won't just die suddenly or stop breathing."
When Nick heard that, he released a sigh of relief.
At least Horua wouldn't die.
"But?" Wyntor asked.
"But," the doctor continued, "his mind has become isolated. His actual consciousness does not interact with the outside world anymore. That means his mind doesn't get new information and also can't share information with others."
"You could say he is conscious but sleeping, in a way. Although, this is a strong simplification of what is actually happening."
Nick looked with worry at the doctor as Wyntor frowned.
"What does that mean?" he asked.
"It means he will continue being in this state for an indeterminate amount of time," the doctor said.
"He won't move on his own. This means he can't eat, drink, or go to the toilet on his own. The only thing he can do is sleep."
Nick took a deep breath. "Can we do anything about this?" he asked.
"It's difficult," the doctor said. "Since we can't really interact with his consciousness, we can't solve the issue. This is a mental problem, and if we want to save him, we need to somehow wake his mind up."
The doctor sighed. "Sadly, that's very difficult. After all, information can only enter a mind when the owner of the mind actively absorbs it."
"We can't just force his mind to listen."
Nick felt his chest tighten. "Is there anything I can do to save him? Maybe one of the recovery baths?"
"No," the doctor said. "Things like recovery baths work on injuries, and Horua technically isn't injured. In a certain way, nothing is wrong with his body."
"The only thing you can do is to keep him alive, talk to him, and hope that he wakes up on his own."
"He might wake up tomorrow."
"He might wake up in a week."
"He might wake up in a year."
"Maybe in ten years."
"Maybe never."
Nick looked at the ground with a horrified expression.
This was difficult to come to terms with.
Horua had turned into this, and it was Nick's fault.
"What if he comes into contact with the Specter again?" Wyntor asked.
The doctor's expression became strict and chilly. "If it's a Specter that feeds on mentality, it can probably change things in Horua's mind, but Specters that help people are not very common."
"But could it help?" Wyntor asked.
The doctor didn't answer for a couple of seconds. "Yes, but the chances are higher that his mental state will worsen or that he will die," the doctor said coldly.
Wyntor nodded. "Thank you. You can send the bill to us later."
The doctor tried her best not to snort.
"Doctor, how can I keep Horua alive?" Nick asked.
The doctor glanced at Nick with a neutral expression.
"Three meals a day that are easy to digest and swallow. Two liters of water a day. Regular change of clothes. His bodily waste needs to be cleaned regularly. Once every two days, you have to wash him. Thrice a day, you have to massage his legs and arms, or he will die of a thrombus."
"A thrombus?" Nick asked in confusion.
Even Wyntor didn't know what that was.
"If you don't move your extremities for a long time, your blood vessels get constricted, and a clot can form in one of them. When the extremity gets moved, the clot travels through the vessels and can get stuck in your heart, lungs, or anywhere else."
"That part will essentially not get any air and die off, killing you with it."
"If you want to keep him alive, you need to do all of that."

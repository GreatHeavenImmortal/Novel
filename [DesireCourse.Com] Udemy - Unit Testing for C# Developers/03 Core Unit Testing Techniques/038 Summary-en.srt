1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, in this section, you learned about a

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
few unit testing scenarios that you see in a lot of real-world applications.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
More specifically, you learned how to test methods that return

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
a string or a collection, you learned how to test

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
void methods, methods that throw an exception, or raise an

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
event, and you learn that you should not test private or

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
protected methods, because of their implementation detail. You should

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
only test the public API, or public interface of a

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
class, which includes only the public members. The next

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
section is all about exercises. So you will have an opportunity

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
to apply what you have learned in the course so far. So, I will see you in the next

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
section.

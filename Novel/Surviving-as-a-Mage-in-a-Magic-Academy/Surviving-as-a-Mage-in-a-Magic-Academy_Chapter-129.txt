Chapter 101
The trio reconvened in front of the sandy beach.
They were stranded on this hellish island, now known as skull principal's Island, and gathered to deliberate their next course of action.
Yi-Han was the first to speak.
"Is it possible to build another boat?"
Silence followed.
Anglago shook his head.
Even crafting a small boat required more resources and effort than expected.
Originally, he was able to make it with the help of other White Tiger students, but it was difficult for him to do it on his own.
"It seems we can't escape on our own..."
"I'm sorry."
"It's alright. But now, we face another problem."
At Yi-Han's serious tone, Anglago and Dukma tensed up.
It was Wardanaz who also defeated the undead who ruled this sandy beach.
What could be so troubling to him?
"What... What is it?"
"If things continue this way, we'll miss tomorrow's classes."
Silence enveloped them.
Initially, both thought Wardanaz was joking. But Yi-Han was gravely serious.
"It's not a joke?"
"Do I look like I'm joking?"
"No, sorry."
"In this situation, shouldn't we be allowed to skip class?"
Dukma, puzzled, inquired. Yi-Han responded in a threatening tone.
"One must never skip classes, regardless of the circumstances. Understand?"
Grades were more important than life itself.
Despite not fully grasping this concept with their minds, the students felt its importance in their hearts.
It seemed genuinely crucial, though the reason was unclear.
"I understand."
"I apologize as well. But Wardanaz, it seems we have no means to attend tomorrow's class..."
The sun was already setting, marking the arrival of the weekend evening.
With the new week approaching, classes were set to begin in the morning.
Could they escape in time?
"Wouldn't someone notice our disappearance and come to rescue us?"
Yi-Han posed the question to them.
Waiting for rescue seemed more realistic than building a boat to escape.
But the duo shook their heads.
"Even if noticed, immediate rescue isn't feasible."
"There are no boats available..."
"Why is the White Tiger, a place of knights, lacking in unity?"
Yi-Han reprimanded them.
The duo felt unjustly accused.
This didn't seem to be a matter of unity!
"Fortunately, Monday morning's lecture is on &lt;Basic Magic Character Education&gt;..."
Yi-Han pondered.
Having skull principal's lecture scheduled for tomorrow could be considered lucky.
If the principal remarked during class, "Has anyone gone to the island for a pass? No? That won't do. I'll give you a chance; go to the island this time," Yi-Han and his companions could be rescued without effort.
But...
"Would the skull principal really do that?"
Would the principal's character lead him to say, "I'll help a bit," if everyone failed the assignment, or was it more likely he would say, "Can't even do this? Try harder"?
While Yi-Han was deep in thought, Anglago had a realization.
"That's it! If we're absent until the class starts, everyone will definitely notice our disappearance, and the principal will come to rescue us! We just need to hold out until then..."
"No. We should explore the island immediately. We have to escape on our own."
Stunned by Yi-Han's response, the two were speechless.
"Couldn't someone come to rescue us... me?"
"That's unlikely."
"But if a student is missing by the time of the class, out of concern..."
"That's unlikely."
Yi-Han firmly asserted his point, leaving the other two disheartened.
‘Regrettably, this is reality.’
Having joined the magic academy, it was time for Anglago and Dukma to face the harsh truth.
Without any hope of rescue from outside, they needed to find a way out from here.
Yi-Han intended to search for other items prepared by skull principal.
‘There must be other things besides the pass and the trials to reach it.’
Perhaps even the small boat they had brought could be hidden somewhere.
A rumbling stomach broke the silence.
Yi-Han turned to see Anglago blushing with embarrassment, his head bowed.
"You must be hungry after all that activity. It's better to eat something. Do we have any food?"
Yi-Han's question was met with confident nods from both.
"Then let's eat before we proceed."
With that, Yi-Han pulled out bread and canned food from his backpack.
Anglago retrieved some tree bark.
Yi-Han initially thought Anglago was using it as a makeshift plate.
However, Anglago held the white bark and said to Dukma, "Dukma, let's boil some water. We'll cook and eat this."
"Wait, wait."
"?"
Anglago and Dukma looked at Yi-Han, puzzled.
Yi-Han, eyeing the tree bark, asked, "You eat that?"
Anglago grinned, a mix of pride in his knowledge. He was pleased to know something Yi-Han didn't.
"Wardanaz, the inner bark of this tree is edible. If boiled well, it's quite tender and sweet."
Yi-Han sighed, frustrated. It was one thing to be short on food, but boiling tree bark to eat?
"I heard White Tiger students hunt for meat. Was I mistaken?"
"We do hunt, but the quantity is often insufficient."
"Wardanaz, you seem unaware. Not everything hunted is caught, and preservation is difficult. Most of the catch is eaten immediately, making it unsuitable for emergency rations."
As the two White Tiger students smugly explained, Yi-Han nearly lost his temper.
He felt a pang of sympathy for them, being human after all.
“...I brought something, so let’s eat together.”
"!"
"Really?"
"That tomato vegetable stew?"
Wardanaz's famed tomato vegetable stew was already legendary, known even among White Tiger students.
"No, I don't carry canned tomatoes or vegetables by the lake. I only brought simple things for myself, and they're not plentiful. We'll have to look for more nearby."
The pair was slightly disappointed at Yi-Han's words.
After all, Wardanaz couldn't have foreseen this situation.
Who would have thought they'd end up stranded on an island while scouting around a lake?
Yi-Han pulled out a pot, a glass bottle of olive oil, butter, salt, pepper, eggs, slightly stale white bread, and pickled bacon from his leather backpack.
The sight left the others speechless.
'He said he only brought simple things for himself...!'
'How well do the Blue Dragon kids live?'
They had never felt embarrassed or regretful about being assigned to the White Tiger, but at this moment, they couldn't help but feel a bit envious.
How did he manage to secure all that?
"It's still not enough."
"Not enough? Isn't that plenty...?"
"I saw some edible mushrooms earlier; we should gather some."
As Yi-Han stood up, the others followed suit.
"Why are you getting up?"
"I said I'd be your arm earlier, didn't I?"
"I can't let you go alone."
The two spoke with a certain solemnity, but Yi-Han asked them coolly.
"Do you know how to identify mushrooms?"
"...I think I got it right once out of three times. Last time."
"We'd probably end up with two of us dead. Never mind. Just dig up what I tell you to."
Knowing which mushrooms to pick was crucial; only the familiar ones should be gathered. It was vital not to harvest any that seemed even slightly off or ominous.
Aware of this, Yi-Han instructed them to pick only the mushrooms he was certain about.
"Dig up that brown mushroom."
"Don't touch that one."
"Throw that one away. It looks strange."
The two White Tiger students, gathering mushrooms in place of the injured Yi-Han, slowly gained confidence in their task.
Could they now identify mushrooms themselves?
"This dull and rough-looking mushroom is safe, right?"
"Throw it away before you put it in your mouth."
Anglago obediently tossed the mushroom aside.
However, Dukma seemed reluctant to give up, continuously attempting his own creative identifications.
"What about this mushroom..."
"This one looks safe to eat. I think I've seen it on the table when I was younger."
"The shape is similar to the one we picked earlier, isn't this edible?"
Watching Dukma's earnest attempts to become proficient in mushroom gathering, Yi-Han, to encourage him, said:
"Yes, that mushroom can be eaten. But only once."
"Oh... Wait, why only once?"
"Because you'll die if you eat it."
Dukma also quietly tossed the mushroom aside and only picked the ones Yi-Han instructed.
Having finished their preparations, the trio built a campfire.
When Yi-Han used flint instead of magic to start the fire, Anglago was puzzled.
"Why use flint?"
"Wardanaz considers the taste in cooking. Grandma told me that fire lit by hand, rather than by magic, is better for cooking."
'Is that so?'
The reason Yi-Han used flint was simple: to avoid accidentally burning the two students with a magic-induced fire.
Instead of explaining, Yi-Han heated the pan with butter and oil.
The secret to deliciously cooking mushrooms was patience and high heat. Tossing them in prematurely would be a mistake.
'...But honestly, since joining the academy, my cooking skills have improved immensely.'
It wasn't a joke; his cooking skills had indeed surpassed his magic skills.
Constantly considering how to make a variety of tasty dishes with limited ingredients had naturally honed his skills.
With proper funding and support, becoming a chef might be a better choice than a mage...
The mushrooms sizzled as they absorbed the oil and butter in the pan.
Yi-Han skillfully rolled the mushrooms to the side and added the cut-up hardened bread to the remaining oil.
When the entire process was finished, and he even skillfully cracked an egg into the pan, the two White Tiger students couldn't help but be amazed.
'These kids seem more impressed than when they heard about me defeating the undead summon.'
"Let's eat."
Yi-Han seasoned the mushrooms, bread, and fried eggs with salt, balancing the flavors.
The trio devoured the food without a word. The fried mushrooms were crispy, and the hardened bread had become moist with oil.
Anglago suddenly felt his eyes welling up with tears.
"I never thought we'd have such a meal again."
"...Me neither, Anglago. I thought we'd never eat like this again in our lives..."
'You've only been here a month.'
Observing the two White Tiger students becoming overly sentimental, Yi-Han silently continued eating.
Despite their emotional state, the students, evidently very hungry, eagerly consumed their food.
Suddenly, there was a rustling sound from behind.
Yi-Han swiftly threw the bowl he was holding to the side and grabbed his staff. Anglago, almost reflexively, dived to catch the thrown bowl.
"Who's there?"
Emerging from the bushes was a water spirit.
The water spirit seemed to be angry at the freshmen who were building a bonfire instead of doing the trials they were told to do. It approached erratically, its form swelling in an irregular pattern, signaling its readiness to attack at any moment.
Yi-Han also stood up, staff in hand, ready to retaliate.
He was quicker to act.
"Attack..."
Before Yi-Han could finish his spell, the water spirit, startled, began to flee.



Chapter 102
As the water spirit fled, Yi-Han also ceased his incantation and shouted.
"Halt right there!"
Upon reflection, all this trouble stemmed from those water spirits in the lake.
Had they not come first, Yi-Han could have leisurely tossed the White Tiger guys onto the sandy beach to thoroughly check them!
"Wardanaz, fighting a spirit in an injured state is a bit risky...!"
Dukma, intending to dissuade him, changed his words upon seeing the fleeing spirit.
"No, it's not dangerous! Let's chase! Onward!"
"Just, just a moment!"
Anglago hurriedly wrapped his food in leather. It was too precious to simply leave behind.
"Chase it! It must be an underling of the skull principal!"
Yi-Han commanded in a voice colder than the chill of the darkening night.
The two White Tiger students ran off, feeling as if they had become the villains.
Despite not doing anything wrong, they couldn't shake off the feeling that they were.
Anglago dodged to the left. A sharp water bead flew towards him, but he narrowly avoided it.
Dukma turned right. A water spike came at him, but he ducked just in time.
'The attacks of the water spirits are really simple.'
Yi-Han thought this as he approached from the center. The water spirit launched an attack at Yi-Han, who, instead of dodging, summoned a water bead and deflected it.
Giorvan the Second, an undead summon on the sandy beach, was a big and powerful creature, but such a low-level water spirit could not defeat Yi-Han in a frontal confrontation.
The water spirit shivered in panic as Yi-Han, exuding a fierce mana, approached.
"Do not flee, water spirit. I mean you no harm."
"...?"
Anglago, aiming his wooden sword at the water spirit, thought to himself.
'In such a situation, would anything be believed?'
If Anglago were the water spirit, he would certainly not trust easily.
"You're an underling of the skull principal, aren't you?"
The water spirit shook its head vehemently.
Though lacking the skill to converse with spirits, the White Tiger students somehow felt they understood what the water spirit was trying to say.
'Absolutely not,' it seemed to convey.
The water spirit, by its nature, evoked sympathy.
Its round, watery form, emanating a gentle water aura, softened people's hostility.
But Yi-Han was not swayed.
"Do not try to deceive me. The skull principal must have ordered you to do this."
"…!"
Dukma was astonished.
Was that the case?
Yet the water spirit again shook its head desperately. Yi-Han pointed out calmly.
"Then why did you attack us crossing the lake, and even when we were resting?"
"Indeed...!"
Confronted with Yi-Han's logical argument, the students had to agree.
Certainly, the water spirit's persistent pursuit and attacks were unusual.
The water spirit flailed, pointing at Yi-Han.
"?"
"What's that?"
Both were clueless as to why the spirit was behaving this way.
Of course, Yi-Han understood.
'It's saying it thought I came to attack them...'
With that, even Yi-Han had nothing to retort.
After all, it was he who had first unleashed his fierce mana over the lake.
"Wardanaz. What is this spirit saying?"
"It thought that your rowing was an attack."
"Ah."
Anglago was at a loss for words to the water spirit.
"It was a mistake," he insisted. "Had I known there were water spirits, I would have been much more careful. I hope you believe that..."
The water spirit looked perplexed at Anglago's excuse, as if questioning what he was talking about.
Was this some sort of joke after Yi-Han had just declared himself fearsome?
Instead of responding verbally, Yi-Han nodded in agreement.
"He says he understands that mistakes can happen."
"That's a relief...!"
"However, there's no excuse for attacking us while we were resting, even if the incident at the lake is overlooked."
Yi-Han quickly moved on from the incident at the lake, considering it fruitless to dwell on it.
The water spirit fell for Yi-Han's cunning ploy.
Forgetting to mention the incident at the lake, it pointed directly at the campfire.
"Are you saying you attacked us because of the fire we lit at night?"
"What nonsense...!"
The White Tiger students were infuriated.
From the spirit's perspective, intruders cooking and emitting smells might have been unpleasant.
But to attack without a warning was far too aggressive!
In its confusion, the water spirit trembled all over, indicating a misunderstanding.
It pointed at the campfire, the scorched marks, and Yi-Han's staff.
Both students were baffled again, but Yi-Han understood immediately.
'Hmm. It was angry because I burned the surroundings.'
The fire he had recklessly spread while battling the undead had polluted the nearby water, understandably upsetting the resting water spirit.
"What is the spirit saying, Wardanaz?"
"It's sincerely apologizing for its narrow-minded actions."
"Hmph... will we forgive it?"
"Yes, it's a spirit, after all."
The two White Tiger students decided to be magnanimous.
Unlike the undead, spirits were a more delicate entity to handle, especially water spirits.
The spirit, sensing the odd turn of the conversation, glared intently at Yi-Han.
Yi-Han chose to ignore it.
The water spirit was not an underling of the skull principal, but it had been a distant observer when the principal visited the island.
Following the spirit's lead, Yi-Han inquired.
"What exactly did the principal use in his spell?"
While Yi-Han might not know all of the skull principal's magic, foreknowledge of his capabilities could prove advantageous.
The spirit couldn't speak, but it inflated and transformed its body, earnestly trying to explain.
'A tomb? A seal? A lock?'
It formed a small tomb shape, added a few bands representing seals, and even something resembling a lock.
Yi-Han began to grasp what the spirit was trying to convey.
'The principal has imprisoned something.'
There was only one thing that could be imprisoned.
It was the leave permit.
'It wouldn't be surprising if something happened when we approached it.'
Yi-Han closed his eyes, trying to envision the principal's mindset.
'If I were the principal, how would I have designed it?'
'A dungeon of trials beneath the sandy beach, and a place with the leave permit accessible only after passing through that dungeon. Sounds like something the principal would do.'
And if that place was locked, it was even more in line with the principal's thinking.
Imagine the despair after struggling through the underground dungeon of the sandy beach, only to find the leave permit at the end locked away.
It was precisely the kind of situation the principal would relish.
"Wardanaz, over there!"
Anglago whispered in a startled voice.
Beyond where the water spirit halted, there indeed lay a place created by the principal.
It was a small but antiquely charming, stone-constructed area.
Yi-Han felt an inexplicable sense of it being akin to a temple.
Stone stairs leading underground (seemingly connected to the sandy beach's underground dungeon), large stone pillars geometrically arranged on all sides with hollow interiors, and a central altar.
Of course, what lay inside the altar was not a sacrificial offering, but rather, the leave permit.
'How do I send these two in first?'
Yi-Han pondered how to get Anglago and Dukma to enter ahead of him.
To uncover the principal's traps, a sacrificial lamb, or rather, an advance party was needed.
"Wardanaz. I'll go first."
"Anglago. Are you insulting me? I should go first."
"Dukma. It's my fault this situation arose. I was the one who angered the water spirit."
"Anglago. You've completed your duty by building and steering the boat. Compared to that, I haven't done anything. If I don't step forward now, my honor as a knight is..."
Yi-Han yawned, then tossed a coin.
Clack -
"Heads. Anglago Alpha. You go."
"...Uh, erm."
Anglago walked forward with a somewhat dazed expression.
He had initially planned to enter first for the injured Wardanaz, but why did he feel so confused now?
'Come if you dare!'
Swallowing his solemn feelings, Anglago surveyed his surroundings.
Even as a scion of a knightly family, one would have heard about magic traps.
Anglago was prepared to withstand whatever traps might be triggered.
Yet, no trap was sprung.
Not when he stepped on the well-fitted stone floor.
Not even as he passed between the stone pillars and approached the altar.
Yi-Han was slightly surprised at this sight.
'Could it be that the skull principal set it to activate only when two people ascend?'
The absence of traps was just as unsettling.
Yi-Han was also focusing all his power to detect any magic or mana around.
But he felt nothing.
Either it was truly absent, or the skull principal's skills were too advanced for Yi-Han to notice.
'It's probably the latter.'
In fact, there were no traps. Yi-Han could be confident in this sensory aspect, having even impressed the professors and the skull principal.
But Yi-Han did not think so.
Impossible!
The skull principal must have done something!
"Wardanaz. There's a note written here by the principal."
"What does it say? That the traps are starting now?"
"No, not that."
-Congratulations on making it this far, young freshmen. You may have been flustered by the sudden trials, but all of this is a process to nurture you young mages.-
'Annoyingly kind.'
Yi-Han thought to himself. The skull principal's kindness felt even more frightening.
-By coming here, you freshmen must have learned to cooperate with friends from different towers. Now, use that learned method for the ultimate cooperation. If you place someone inside these stone pillars, the seal on the altar containing the leave permit will be released!-
The trio turned their heads to look at the side. The large stone pillars, hollow inside, was spacious enough to easily fit a person.
If placing someone inside those pillars was the key...
Whether the altar opens or not, doesn't this just take them further away from getting the outing pass?
"This is absurd! There must be another way!"
Dukma erupted in anger.
As someone hailing from a knightly family, he couldn't accept a trap that would separate students who had diligently united their strength to overcome trials.
Surely there had to be another method!
'It seems unlikely.'
In contrast, Yi-Han remained composed.
Such a scenario was exactly the kind of thing the skull principal would relish, and it didn't surprise him in the least.
Even if many joined forces, in the end, only one would obtain what they desired! If they felt aggrieved, they should improve their skills...
'Such nonsense, no doubt.'
Yi-Han pondered.
Should he overpower Dukma first, or should he subdue Anglago first?
Yi-Han was at a disadvantage because three people arrived at the altar, where normally two people would have arrived.
Moreover, wasn't one of his arms injured?
To win, he needed to strike first before the White Tiger guys could attack.
"Wardanaz!"
Dukma shouted. Yi-Han flinched.
'Has he caught on?'
"Stop Anglago!"
At that, Yi-Han looked up to see Anglago rushing toward the stone pillar.
Yi-Han hesitated for a moment, wondering whether he should stop him or feign weakness and leave him be.



Chapter 103
"Anglago, what are you doing!"
"Dukma. I will be the one to sacrifice."
Anglago spoke with grave determination.
"Of course, the evil deeds committed by that Wardanaz can never be forgiven, but..."
'These kids, they are too persistent,' thought Yi-Han to himself.
It seems like it's time to forget the grudges of the past!
"...If Wardanaz hadn't helped us this time, we would still be trapped in the dungeon. We can't deny that. I will yield this outing pass to Wardanaz and earn the next one with my own strength."
"Anglago. Your nobility has earned my respect. I will join you!"
Dukma, who had tried to stop him, was also persuaded by Anglago's words.
If only one among them was to have the outing pass, it had to be Wardanaz of the Tower of the Blue Dragon.
Yi-Han was deeply moved for the first time by the conscientious behavior of the White Tiger boys.
'So these kids do have a conscience after all.'
Yi-Han was happily ready to shout 'Then go ahead and enter', but the Water Spirit urgently grabbed his sleeve.
"?"
The Water Spirit gestured frantically, as if asking him to stop them.
Yi-Han didn't understand, but he could feel the urgency of the spirit.
"Understood. Burst forth!"
A water orb swiftly flew and tripped the running friends from the White Tiger.
The two who fell forward rolled on the ground. The students looked at Yi-Han with baffled expressions and exclaimed.
"What are you doing, Wardanaz?!"
"What is this madness!"
Having tripped them, Yi-Han realized he might have done it too harshly.
'If I say I tripped them because the spirit told me to, they'll probably explode with anger...'
Yi-Han thought of a different reason to appease them.
Honor was always a good thing.
"Would I, who carries the name of a noble family, accept an outing pass gained through another's sacrifice?"
"!!!"
While the two were too shocked to speak, Yi-Han whispered softly to the Water Spirit.
"If you stopped me for no good reason, I'll lock you up in there."
The Water Spirit, trembling at Yi-Han's words, began to explain.
It pointed at the pillar, at the student, and made an 'X' with its hands.
Yi-Han felt a flash of intuition.
"Could it be that even if we put a student in, it won't open?"
The Water Spirit nodded its head.
Yi-Han was astounded.
He thought he had begun to understand the mind of the skull principal, but really, the principal was beyond his grasp.
What kind of person is this?
The door won't open even if we put a person in??
'How has he not been assassinated until now?'
Yi-Han slowly moved towards the altar.
Now, he was certain there were no other traps nearby.
It was better that there were no traps around for them to realize that after fighting each other and one being trapped, the altar still wouldn't open.
"Let's find another way. There must be a way to open it."
"Wardanaz..."
Anglago nodded with a trembling voice, still overwhelmed by emotion.
Yi-Han powerfully poured his mana onto the altar, just like he had done at the White Tiger Tower before.
Bang!
A powerful collision of magic, inaudible, spread out. The Water Spirit, startled, lay down.
"This, what is this?! What on earth...?!"
"I tried to dispel the magic with my mana, but I failed," Yi-Han lamented.
Dukma expressed his disappointment and then hesitated.
"...Wait, didn't Wardanaz use this to infiltrate last time?"
The students of the White Tiger were still unable to figure out how Wardanaz had managed to breach the magic at the entrance of the rest area with his friends.
How exactly did he break through the entrance's magic?
But now, looking at it, could it be...?
Yi-Han tried various methods, such as knocking on the altar, exploring the structure by flowing in mana, and shaking it by firing mana.
However, the altar remained unmoved.
At this point, Yi-Han began to doubt.
'Isn't it enchanted with defensive magic?'
If it were protected by magic as he had experienced before, there would have been some reaction, no matter how cunningly and delicately it was cast.
It was too... quiet.
Initially, Yi-Han thought it was because of the skull principal's superior magic skills and his own lack of ability, but then he thought there was no harm in trying.
"Everyone, step back."
"?"
As Yi-Han conjured a water mass several times larger than usual and began to slowly add rotation, the two students from the White Tiger were perplexed.
"It's better to keep some more distance."
"???"
Though they didn't understand fully, sensing something ominous, the two slowly backed away.
The Water Spirit, even before Yi-Han spoke, had already moved a considerable distance away.
Bang!
Although Professor Boladi had warned not to be greedy for rotating attributes, if a professor's duty was to trouble the students, then a student's duty was to disobey and rebel against the professor's words.
Yi-Han, following this principle, ignored Professor Boladi's advice and once again perfected the Water Bullet.
It took over ten minutes, but it was worth it.
The rotating, exploding mass of water collided with the altar and completely shattered it.
Anglago and Dukma, startled by the loud noise, ducked. They had kept their distance, but hadn't anticipated such power.
The force not only destroyed the altar but also devastated its surroundings.
'What kind of magic is that?'
Both felt chills run down their spines.
They had seen Yi-Han use water elemental magic before, but never to this extent.
They had studied magic together under Professor Garcia, but where did this magic come from?
'Did he find forbidden magic in the library?'
'It must be a secret of the Wardanaz family!'
Yi-Han staggered with a tired expression.
His mana was overflowing, but concentrating on a single spell for over ten minutes had strained his nerves.
It was no surprise he was exhausted.
Swoosh!
Just then, the black book gifted by the skull principal, as if alive, slipped out of Yi-Han's pocket.
It opened on its own, flipping pages and spilling out words like before.
The shock of knowledge being hammered directly into his brain.
When the shock subsided, the new magic knowledge left in Yi-Han's mind was &lt;Gonadaltes' Sharp Hand&gt;.
A 2nd circle physical enhancement spell that bestowed a chilling sharpness to a mage's hand!
...But why now?
'What's the meaning of this?'
Yi-Han looked at the black book incredulously, but the book, as if it had done its job, paid no heed and slipped back into his pocket.
'Is it mocking me for crudely smashing it? Could it actually be?'
The possibility was frightening.
Yi-Han couldn't be 100% sure that this black book wasn't an evil grimoire.
"Wardanaz. Are you okay...?"
"I'm fine. Go and look for the outing pass."
Yi-Han's words were meant for Anglago, but the Water Spirit rushed forward excitedly.
The leopard bone summon watched the Water Spirit and, seeming angry, struck the ground.
"..."
Yi-Han wanted to explain to the Water Spirit that it was a misunderstanding, but he was too tired to muster the energy.
Pitter-patter-
The Water Spirit respectfully searched for and presented the outing pass.
Although covered in some dust due to the destruction of the altar, the pass was intact.
"You did it, Wardanaz! You've done it!"
"You overcame all those traps and succeeded!"
Both were as delighted as if it were their own achievement. The Water Spirit, noticing the mood, also clapped.
Yi-Han carefully examined the outing pass. It was of the same format as the one he had received before.
A rectangular piece of paper with the phrase granting one day of outing to the student possessing the outing pass, complete with the principal's signature.
"Bring that flat rock over here."
"Why, Wardanaz? I don't know what you plan to do, but you can rest a bit first!"
"No. I'm doing it now."
Yi-Han took out a quill and several ink bottles from his backpack.
When he first used the outing pass, what Yi-Han regretted most was not the inability to use carriages or summon creatures.
The greatest regret was not being able to forge the pass.
Creating a fake pass wasn't easy. It required paper of a suitable material and various colors of ink.
Yi-Han had meticulously gathered the necessary items from outside and completed his collection with what he couldn't find from Professor Uregor's workshop.
Always ready to create a counterfeit as soon as he got his hands on an outing pass.
"...Could it be?"
"Is he really doing it now?"
Anglago and Dukma were astonished.
At first, they denied it, but the more they looked, the more apparent it became.
'He's forging it, Wardanaz!!'
'What on earth...?!!'
Yi-Han, with the solemn expression of a skilled artisan, laid out his tools on the rock.
The atmosphere was so serious that the two couldn't even bring themselves to speak.
"Move."
At Yi-Han's command, the quill slightly lifted into the air. The magic originally used to manipulate quills had finally found its true purpose.
While immense skill was needed to use &lt;Lesser Control&gt; more delicately than a human hand, for Yi-Han, that was already a tale of the past.
Professor Boladi's theories of magic combat were now blooming at the fingertips of his disciple, in the form of forging an outing pass.
The two gaped as they watched a fake pass being skillfully and swiftly completed before their eyes.
"This is preposterous, such audacity!"
"Is this even possible??"
While Yi-Han and the students of the White Tiger were stranded on the island in the lake, the students of the other towers were busy with their tasks.
Among them, the students of the Tower of the Blue Dragon remained in the rest area, flipping through books, trying to figure out the remaining potions.
"Ah... If I had that potion again, maybe I could figure it out. Can't we have it back?"
"Someone tie up Gainando, please."
"Where did Wardanaz go?"
"He went to check the lake. He said we should prepare our own lunch."
Yi-Han had even sorted out the ingredients in front of the rest area's campfire before leaving.
Seeing the ingredients, the students' faces lit up with a faint excitement.
Having always been served by servants, the sudden opportunity to cook ignited a newfound creativity in them.
"Can I try making a pie?"
"Sure, what kind of pie?"
"I read about it in a book once, a pie baked with fish inside. It looked delicious."
"You're disqualified."
"Why!?"
Despite some friction, the students of the Tower of the Blue Dragon enjoyed cooking and waited eagerly.
...But Yi-Han did not return.
"Why isn't Wardanaz coming?"
"Gainando, you rascal. Did you upset Wardanaz?"
"No, no! I did all the assignment by myself!"
"Was it because you were noisy during last night's dinner? You should eat quietly with gratitude, but you acted without manners..."
"Ugh..."
Like children anxious about their parents who hadn't returned late from work, the students were worried.
"We can't just sit here. I'll go check the lake."
"Me too. Let's go together."
The students of the Tower of the Blue Dragon gathered and hurried to the lakeside.
However, Yi-Han, who had already departed, was nowhere to be seen at the lake.
The students of the Tower of the Blue Dragon, who had hoped against hope that Yi-Han might be there, began to feel a creeping fear.
"Let's search around!"
"Maybe he went somewhere else. Ask around!"
The students of the Tower of the Blue Dragon dispersed to inquire separately.
During their search, some heard astonishing news.
"Students from the White Tiger have disappeared?"
"Those empty-headed fools?!"
"What happened?"
"They're saying the White Tiger guys kidnapped Wardanaz!"
"The White Tiger guys? ...Wait, is that even possible?"



Chapter 104
Yonaire expressed her doubts upon hearing that the White Tiger students had kidnapped Yi-Han. She wondered if it was even possible.
Ratford, who had been among the Black Tortoise students, tilted his head in confusion and said, "It seems difficult, doesn't it?"
"No, it's possible," Nillia said with a face full of worry. Her long ears drooped down to either side, weighed down by concern.
"The cleverest of beasts can fall into traps."
"But Yi-Han is not a beast..."
"What if the cowardly White Tiger had set a trap on the path Wardanaz walks? Or poisoned the water Wardanaz drinks? Or drugged the bread Wardanaz eats? Or..."
Yonaire and Ratford pondered how to dissuade Nillia.
Were they planning Yi-Han's grave in advance?
The bigger issue was that the students of the Blue Dragon began to take Nillia's words seriously.
"If a hunter from the &lt;Shadow Patrol&gt; speaks like this, there's a high chance he was really kidnapped..."
"According to my calculations, there's a 90% probability that the White Tiger bastards kidnapped him."
"These scoundrels, I'll kill them!"
"Everyone calm down. Let's calmly plan how to kill them."
Yonaire sought other students in an attempt to calm the situation.
'The princess...'
But to her dismay, the princess was already among the students, seriously planning an attack on the White Tiger.
Yonaire hung her head low.
Without Yi-Han, there was no one in the tower who made any sense.
'Please come back...!'
On Monday morning, the atmosphere in the &lt;Basic Magic Character Education&gt; class was far more menacing than usual.
Normally, the class was far from being in good spirits.
Everyone always had a gloomy aura, as if they were dragged to a grave.
But today was different.
The students of the Blue Dragon glared as if they were ready to attack at any moment, sparks flying from their eyes.
"Can't you say where Wardanaz is?"
"How can you spout such nonsense, you Blue Dragon fools! Do you think we would do such a thing? We don’t do such acts!"
"You dare gang up three against one!"
A White Tiger student's face reddened when their sore spot was hit.
A student from the Blue Dragon menacingly waved his staff, as if ready to cast a curse.
"Tell us where Wardanaz is!"
"We’re also confused because two of us have disappeared. Didn't you kidnap them?"
The Blue Dragon students were infuriated by the response of the White Tiger students.
They dared to insult the honor of their noble lineage.
"Us? Us?? Do you dare speak like that knowing our family's honor?"
"People who sneak into others' dorm towers at night have no right to talk."
Jijel said mockingly.
This time, it was the Blue Dragon students who were hit in their sore spot.
However, there was an unexpected opponent, Gainando.
"We've never done that."
"..."
"Do you have proof? If you have proof, bring it. Show us the evidence that we did it."
"Is that guy really royalty?"
The White Tiger students murmured among themselves. Even among the Black Tortoise students, there was no one as shameless as this.
"I don't think it's my place to interfere, but if you really kidnapped Wardanaz, wouldn't it be better to return him and reconcile? Class is about to start soon."
In the Black Tortoise, the dwarf, no, the elf student Salko Tutanta opened his mouth.
The White Tiger students frowned as if wondering where he came in, but the Black Tortoise students behind Salko stood their ground.
Each of them, with their rough backgrounds, was not easily intimidated, even by students from knightly families.
The students of the Immortal Phoenix also spoke up. Priestesses Siana and Tijiling cautiously said, "If you have kidnapped Mr. Yi-Han of the Wardanaz family, it would be better to return him..."
"No, we didn't!"
Being suspected by students of all three towers, the White Tiger students could not hold back their frustration.
They too had lost two of their own and had spent the night wondering, 'Was it Wardanaz who kidnapped them?' 'Were there really two missing?' 'But we lost even when three of us attacked...'
The cunning students of the Blue Dragon were stirring the atmosphere strangely.
Jijel stepped forward to manage the situation.
The leading elf of the White Tiger students, chewing her lip as if displeased with the whole situation, said, "I swear on the name of my family, we did not lay a finger on Wardanaz. If you don’t believe me, ask the other students here. Some of them have ties with your side."
There were others in the White Tiger like Rowena, a follower of Princess Adenart, and Dolgyu, considered somewhat reliable.
As all eyes turned to them, Rowena carefully replied, "Your Highness, from what I see... there seemed to be no plan of kidnapping."
At her words, the students of the Blue Dragon's gaze shifted to the princess, who shook her head coldly, clearly not believing them.
"Your Highness?! Your Highness?!?"
Rowena felt as if the sky was falling, shocked that the princess she served did not believe her words.
The students of the Blue Dragon became emboldened.
"See, she doesn't believe it!"
"Indeed, hiding some suspicious schemes. Dolgyu of the Choi family! We'd like to hear your opinion. What do you think?"
Jijel, determined not to be outdone, also pressed Dolgyu.
"Go on. Tell us what you think."
Dolgyu realized that Jijel's voice could not get any colder, a sign of extreme anger.
Had it not been for the presence of other tower students, curses and dual swords might have been drawn.
"In my opinion... I haven't heard of any kidnapping plans."
"There, you see!"
"But I'm not finished yet!"
Mixed reactions followed. Jijel turned to Dolgyu and asked, "You don’t doubt my word when I've sworn on my family's name, do you?"
Dolgyu hesitated slightly.
Before entering the magic academy, Dolgyu would have replied, 'If you say so, then I must believe you.' But his thoughts had changed after joining the school.
If Yi-Han of the renowned Wardanaz family could misuse his family name so freely, there was no reason Jijel couldn't.
"...Choi! You really...!"
Just as Jijel was about to argue in an almost horrified voice, the temperature in the classroom dropped.
Everyone could feel it.
“Good morning! What were you doing?”
"Nothing at all."
"Just exchanging greetings."
Despite their anger towards each other, the students were not foolish enough to confess everything in front of the skull principal. In this hellish school, there were certain unspoken rules. One of them was to keep silent in front of the skull principal.
"Were you fighting just now? Don't you want to fight more?"
"It seems there has been a misunderstanding."
"How well do we get along?"
The skull principal clicked his tongue, apparently disappointed.
The students, who had been glaring at each other as if ready to kill, now seemed inclined to reconcile.
"Boring lot. Alright then. Did anyone bring the leave permit?"
An awkward silence followed. The skull principal spoke as if he had expected this.
"Such a disappointment. No one! Your seniors always completed these tasks on time."
If Yi-Han were here, he would have probably said, 'Don't fall for such nonsense.' Unfortunately, Yi-Han was already on the island for advanced studies.
The students were disheartened and looked dejected.
"Can't be helped. This time, I'll give you a chance. Stand up, everyone. Walk to the lake!"
The students were taken aback by the unexpected generosity of the skull principal.
Of course, they didn't know what awaited them on the island.
As Yi-Han always said, one should be suspicious when the skull principal is kind.
The skull principal watched with glee as the students walked towards the lakeside.
The lake was initially too difficult for the freshmen to cross on their own.
The skull principal hadn't really expected the students to complete the task.
He started with a task knowing that if he suddenly said, 'Cross the lake to the island,' during class, someone might suspect or run away.
By giving them an impossible task and then seeming to generously allow them to cross the lake, even the smartest freshmen couldn't suspect anything.
How long had the skull principal been teaching students at this magic academy?
The freshmen could never escape from the palm of his hand.
'Wait a minute. Where did that brat of the Wardanaz family go?'
Thinking of a nickname Yi-Han would find annoying, the skull principal rotated his floating head 360 degrees.
Still, Yi-Han was nowhere to be seen.
The Principal wondered if Yi-Han had already crossed the lake.
Although Wardanaz was a freshman, he was no ordinary mage. It wouldn’t be strange if he had tried to cross.
But even if he had, the moment he set foot on the beach, he should have been transferred to the underground dungeon.
Even if he was lucky enough to avoid it...
Giorvan the Second, waiting on the sandy beach, would have caught him.
'If he skipped class for some other reason, he’s lucky. But if he's already on the island, that's unfortunate.'
Since the trial in the dungeon wouldn't start until students from different towers arrived together, it was meant for them to fight, or rather, to bond.
What if someone crossed the lake over the weekend?
They would just have to sit in the underground and wait.
Tinkle!
With a twinkle in his eyes, the skull principal created a path of ice on the lake. The students marveled at the feat of raising thick ice over the lake with just a glance.
"Surely none of you will be too frightened to retreat now? Especially not in Einroguard, where only the empire's finest are gathered? Pair up and start."
"Do we have to pair up?"
A student asked, to which the skull principal kindly replied.
"If you'll all go up together, you’ll break the ice and just feed the monsters under the lake."
"...We'll go in pairs."
The reason for not sending them in groups was simple.
If that had happened, one or two might escape the sandy beach unscathed.
The students were sent in pairs to prevent any from escaping.
This was the educational philosophy of the skull principal, who oversaw the empire's premier magic academy.
The students crossed the lake, two by two, on a path made of ice.
However, as the first students set foot on the sandy beach, the skull principal felt a sharp sense of unease with his keen instincts.
This unease soon became a reality. The students did not sink into the sandy beach as expected.
The skull principal felt a pain as if his non-existent soul was being torn apart, seeing his carefully planned lecture going awry.
“Why?!”
"What?!"
The students nearby were startled by the Principal's anguished voice.
They had never heard such sorrow in his voice before.
“Why! Giorvan the Second, I gave you a name and you dare to be so insolently lazy…”
Just as the skull principal was about to call his summon, he realized that Giorvan the Second had been unsummoned.
The missing boy from the Wardanaz family, the disobedient sandy beach, Giorvan the Second unsummoned.
All these signs pointed to only one conclusion.
When the impossible is excluded, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
The skull principal felt he hadn't been this shocked in centuries.
“Wardanaz! Wardanaz, you rascal!!”
As if answering his call, Yi-Han appeared in the distance from deep within the island, his face tired and pale.



Chapter 105
“Because of your pride, the precious learning opportunity for the students is missed…”
The students of the Blue Dragon, interrupting the nonsensical ramblings of the skull principal, exclaimed in surprise.
"Wardanaz!"
"You were alive! We thought you had been kidnapped!"
"Kidnapped?"
Anglago, following behind, asked in confusion, unable to comprehend.
Who would dare to kidnap Wardanaz, and how?
"Hands up! Don't move. If you do, I'll cast a curse!"
The Blue Dragon students, upon spotting Anglago and Dukma, aimed their staffs at them first.
"Why, why are you doing this!"
"These cunning ones... They must have brought him to the lake to avoid leaving any evidence after kidnapping near the academy!"
Gainando, a fan of the popular imperial detective novel 'Dog Mixed-Blood Detective Toveris', displayed sharp deductive skills that even Asan found plausible.
"It wasn't a kidnapping. We were just exploring the lake and got drifted away."
"Oh. Is that so?"
"Well then."
"Be more careful next time."
Upon hearing Yi-Han's words, the Blue Dragon students quickly lowered their staffs.
The White Tiger students were so dumbfounded that they could only gape in disbelief.
'How shameless can these nobles be?'
They had been quite different when they first enrolled; it was a mystery how they had changed so much.
"Aren't you going to apologize? You accused us of being kidnappers and just left it at that?"
"No. In this happy moment of finding our lost friends, do we really need to argue over who was wrong? Aren't you being too harsh?"
"You're worse than scoundrels...!"
While a few of the White Tiger students argued heatedly, most were more concerned with something else.
"Anglago, are you okay? Any breaks or injuries? Did Wardanaz cast any strange magic on you?"
"Dukma, how many fingers am I holding up? Remember the name of my family? Tell me."
The White Tiger students were deeply concerned about the well-being of Anglago and Dukma, who had spent the night with Yi-Han.
They feared the worst, that they might have been victims of some vile dark magic...
"Don't worry, everyone. It was chaotic, but... nothing much happened with Wardanaz. In fact, we owe our lives to him."
"Wardanaz defeated a summoned creature hiding in the sands of the beach. Without him, we all would have been dragged down."
Anglago and Dukma shared their experiences with the gathering students.
The story of the skull principal's evil scheme and how Wardanaz thwarted it!
It was such an interesting tale that students from other towers gathered to listen.
"...It's unbelievable. Could they have been brainwashed by Wardanaz?"
"No matter what, it's hard to believe..."
Some students of the White Tiger shook their heads in disbelief.
So, the principal created a dungeon under the sandy beach of the island, summoned a monster, and gave the students assignments to naturally lead them there?
It was a story too hard to believe.
However, the students soon learned the truth of it.
The skull principal himself began confessing everything.
“Well done! You did well, Wardanaz. Because of you, other students missed the chance to learn, but still, well done!”
"...I'm sorry."
Yi-Han apologized, though he found it ridiculous.
It was better not to upset the already sullen skull principal.
Being narrow-minded was, after all, a trait inherent to professors.
The skull principal, feeling unjustly wronged and regretful, continued to grumble and reveal everything he had prepared.
Upon hearing what had been prepared beneath the sands of the beach, the faces of the students who had crossed the lake turned pale with shock.
He had prepared such a thing???
"Shouldn't we report this person to His Majesty the Emperor...?"
"Shh. Be quiet. Do you want to be dragged under the sand?"
After grumbling for a while, the skull principal seemed somewhat appeased and addressed Yi-Han.
"Anyway... managing to obtain a leave permit on your own. I must commend you for that."
As he spoke, Yi-Han's broken arm was completely healed. Yi-Han bowed his head.
"Thank you."
“Because of you, next year's freshmen will face even harsher trials.”
"It is truly regrettable."
Of course, Yi-Han didn't really feel regretful. It wasn't his fault, after all.
"And I didn't do it all by myself."
Yi-Han pointed to Anglago and Dukma.
Normally, when committing illegal acts, accomplices should be well rewarded.
Now that he had created fake leave permits, the two were basically accomplices.
However, the two students from the White Tiger shook their heads.
"We didn't do anything."
"In reality... it was all done by Wardanaz."
“I know that. Do you think I'm blind? I never intended to give you two special points from the start.”
"..."
The skull principal had a talent for making the same words sound infuriating.
They hadn't expected something like 'Your friendship and honor are commendable! I will give you all special points!...’
But hearing it like that, it was indeed infuriating.
'Let's see after graduation.'
'Really, let's see after we graduate.'
Having made enemies of the two White Tiger students, the skull principal turned his gaze back to Yi-Han. And he said, “Yi-Han of the Wardanaz family. For accomplishing a special task that the other ironheads couldn't, I'll give you special points. Now, show me the leave permit.”
Yi-Han took out the leave permit and placed it on his palm.
The moment a light flashed in the skull principal's eyes, the leave permit disappeared, having been teleported to one of the principal's storerooms.
"...???"
"????????"
While the swindled Yi-Han remained silent, the other students were startled.
Even those who usually held back their fear of the principal couldn't contain themselves this time.
"Principal! This isn't what you promised!"
"How can you so easily break your promise to us! Have you forgotten your honor?"
“When did I ever break a promise?”
Instead of getting angry or intimidating, the skull principal simply asked in return.
His brazen question was enough to slightly unsettle the students.
Was the skull principal trying to act shamelessly, like Gainando?
"But Principal... you said... if we completed this task... you would give us a leave permit."
“Oh dear. Oh dear... It seems you all wasted your time in &lt;Basic Imperial Language and Logic&gt;. What exactly did I say?”
The exact words of the skull principal.
-There is an island on that lake. I've hidden a leave permit there. Work together and bring it to me.-
...clearly showed that he had never said he would give them a leave permit.
He had only said to bring it to him!
The skull principal, seeing the students' faces and feeling slightly better, spoke kindly.
“Now you understand how important every single word in a contract is, don't you? It's good that you all learned a valuable lesson!”
"..."
"..."
Yi-Han couldn't even guess how many of the students present would come looking to assassinate the principal after graduation.
If looks could kill, the skull principal would have already fallen dead.
In a twist of events, the Dragon brat—no, Wardanaz—was called upon by the skull principal to voice his thoughts. "Do you think I've deceived you?"
‘Did he just call me Dragon brat?’
Yi-Han was not fooled by the skull principal's soft voice.
A student must always respond humbly to a professor's inquiry about any grievances, acknowledging their own fault in causing the professor's concern.
To protest further would risk being sent beneath the sands of the beach.
"No, Principal. I never harbored any desire for the leave permit from the beginning. Why would I have any complaints?"
The skull principal looked at Yi-Han with a mix of admiration and regret.
Yi-Han was an extraordinarily talented student, not only in magic but also in other skills.
Usually, magic talent and self-control were inversely proportional. Talent often bred arrogance.
Even students with half of Yi-Han's talent would brazenly challenge the principal as freshmen, only to learn humility after a few stints in the punishment room.
Yet, this boy from the Wardanaz family possessed an unbelievable combination of talent and self-restraint.
Admirable and remarkable as it was, the skull principal couldn't help feeling a sense of loss.
There was no fun in it!
'He's not taking the bait...'
The skull principal was not disappointed, though. Time was on his side, and another opportunity would present itself.
"Very well. Everyone should take a lesson from Wardanaz. Do you understand?"
"Yes..."
"We understand..."
Yi-Han, though not versed in mind-reading, could almost hear the students' thoughts.
The most pressing concern wasn't the mages who might seek revenge on the skull principal in the future.
'I never expected the principal to do this. What a relief.'
Yi-Han inwardly sighed in relief.
He hadn't anticipated that the skull principal would actually take away the leave permit.
But luck was on his side.
In a moment of quick thinking, he had presented a fake permit, and the principal had not noticed, making it disappear.
Anglago and Dukma looked at Yi-Han, their faces a mix of astonishment and disbelief.
'Could he have prepared for this scenario...?'
'What are you, Wardanaz...?'
Though Yi-Han hadn't anticipated this exact situation and created the fake permits, the two could only misconstrue.
"Wardanaz... How did you...?"
"Shh. Be quiet."
Yi-Han placed a finger to his lips.
The skull principal was still nearby.
If he sensed something amiss and retrieved the permit from his storeroom, Yi-Han would be heading not to the beach sands but to the punishment room.
"Can we really accept such a valuable item?"
Anglago and Dukma carefully tucked the fake leave permit into their pockets, wary of being seen.
Yi-Han hadn't just created one for himself; he had also forged permits for Anglago and Dukma in his spare time.
The mere pieces of paper felt as heavy as gold.
"Use them carefully. Especially, do not use it when the principal is around. If caught, you'll be apprehended immediately."
"Of course."
"We understand, Wardanaz."
The two students from the White Tiger took Yi-Han's warning seriously and moved on.
Yi-Han was left wondering.
'But will these fake leave permits actually work?'
He had made them, yet even he wasn't sure of their effectiveness.
Perhaps they might work if used when the principal was not around and with permission from another professor…
The problem Yi-Han faced was dealing with the aftermath of their return.
'Would they lock me in the punishment room for about a month?'
Initially, Yi-Han decided to observe his friends from the White Tiger using the fake leave permits before making any moves. Although he possessed a real one, using it while the skull principal was around felt risky.
Following the path that had appeared over the lake, the students made their way back as they had come.
Yi-Han also hurried to prepare for departure. He was apprehensive that the skull principal, although it seemed unlikely, might dismiss him and remove the ice path, leaving him stranded.
The Water Spirit waved at Yi-Han, signaling a farewell.
"Thank you. Without you, I might still be wandering around the island."
The Water Spirit appeared to blush at the gratitude.
This sight sparked a sudden thought in Yi-Han.
'Wait. Have I just become friends with a spirit?'
Upon reflection, this felt like a more natural closeness than the shouting matches he'd had with beings like Ferkuntra.
Yi-Han opened his mouth to speak.
"Perhaps you and I could..."
But the Water Spirit, not waiting to hear Yi-Han's words, dashed off and began frolicking in front of Nillia, who was about to leave. It seemed as if the spirit was pleading for a contract with her.
"..."
Yi-Han felt a deep sense of betrayal.



Chapter 106
Yonaire, understanding the situation, gently patted Yi-Han's shoulder in consolation.
"Spirits are like capricious unrequited loves; no matter how well you treat them, often you can't win their hearts," she mused. In such cases, acceptance was the only option.
"Yonaire, I'm really okay," Yi-Han insisted.
"Uh-huh..."
"I am, truly."
"Sure, sure."
Usually, when 'really' was prefixed, it was often a lie. Yonaire decided to let it slide this time.
Nillia was flustered when the Water Spirit clung to her, an entity Yi-Han had desired to contract with, making it impossible for her to reciprocate.
"Hey, go away! Contract with Wardanaz over there!" Nillia pushed the Water Spirit away, but it persistently clung to her, clearly taken with her.
This saddened Yi-Han slightly. 'I only ever attract the senile Lightning Spirits,' he thought. But even in sadness, there were times to celebrate for a friend's sake.
Yi-Han spoke coldly, "Nillia, I think there's a misunderstanding. I have no intention of contracting with the Water Spirit."
"What? Really?" Nillia's ears perked up in surprise.
"But you were about to propose a contract earlier."
"You must have heard wrong."
Yonaire marveled internally. Yi-Han had many talents, but his unrivaled skill was lying blatantly with a straight face. His earnest lies swayed even the most skeptical.
"Nillia, I'm not interested in that spirit."
"But... you've wanted to contract with a spirit since before. And you said the Water Spirit was good."
'If only she didn't remember such trivial details so well,' Yi-Han thought irritably.
"It seems you're mistaken. Of course, I talked about contracting with a Water Spirit, but it was about a renowned one, Nillia."
"Ah...!"
Nillia smacked her palm with her fist as if it made sense, especially considering Wardanaz's talent. The Water Spirit clapped its hands in surprise at this revelation. Yi-Han felt an urge to smack the spirit.
"Understand? So, if you want to contract with that spirit, feel free. It doesn't concern me."
"Hmm... What should I do..."
Nillia pondered. She hadn't ruled out contracting with a spirit, but this was unexpectedly sudden.
"What do you guys think?"
At Nillia's question, Yi-Han and Yonaire exchanged glances.
In their opinion...
'Nillia could use more friends.'
'A spirit friend would be even better.'
They nodded in agreement.
"A Water Spirit seems like a good idea," Yi-Han said.
"I think so too!"
"If you both say so..."
Nillia nodded, and the Water Spirit jumped joyously.
After spending the weekend on an island with the undead summon, Yi-Han found Professor Boladi's face welcoming.
Yi-Han was frightened by his own gladness to see him.
'I've heard there's no cure for Stockholm Syndrome.'
"Good day..."
"Last time, you used lightning magic," Boladi noted without exchanging pleasantries or asking about the weekend.
"Yes..." Yi-Han sighed internally, having braced himself for this. He had a sad certainty about it since meeting Professor Boladi in front of Professor Garcia.
-"Ah, Professor Boladi is going to teach lightning magic as well."-
And such a foreboding feeling had never been wrong.
"Lightning element is less commonly mastered among mages than the water element."
"I see."
"It's harder to handle than water."
"Yes."
"But since you used lightning magic last time, you should be able to handle what I'm about to teach."
Yi-Han remained silent. He almost suggested to Professor Boladi to take a course in &lt;Basic Imperial Language and Logic&gt;.
'What kind of logic is that...'
"I've heard the stories," Professor Boladi said, looking at Yi-Han.
Yi-Han was startled. Was Professor Boladi deviating from his usual lectures to engage in idle student chatter, or something else entirely?
It was said that sudden changes in behavior could be ominous...
"I heard you defeated Gonadaltes's summon, Giorvan the Second."
“...”
Yi-Han would have been annoyed if the skull principal had been there, having successfully irritated him.
He was angry with the skull principal.
'How many hours have passed since...?'
He had seen the skull principal in the morning, and now, having had lunch, he had entered Professor Boladi's classroom. In that short time, the principal had been remarkably busy spreading the news.
"Indeed... I could defeat it thanks to what I learned from you, Professor."
"That's expected. But that's not why I brought it up. I heard you were ambushed by a summon and injured your arm."
'Damn it.'
Yi-Han faintly guessed why the skull principal had mentioned it.
"An unexpected situation occurred."
"In battle, that's always the case. But whatever excuse you make after being hit, the enemy won't listen."
The most irritating thing about Professor Boladi was his irrefutable, correct statements.
"So I prepared for that."
Yi-Han didn't ask 'What is it this time?', instead focusing intently on every minute movement of Boladi, his staff in hand, ready to respond to any trickery.
The professor seemed pleased with Yi-Han's reaction, a faint smile playing on his lips.
Sparks flew in the air, and a small lightning bolt appeared, aimed at Yi-Han.
Yi-Han tried to deflect it with a water orb, but Boladi countered with a water orb of his own, neutralizing it.
Yi-Han had no choice but to dodge physically. Fortunately, avoiding the incoming lightning bolt wasn't impossible.
The linear trajectory of the lightning bolt, though much faster than other elements, was still slower than actual lightning and predictably straight.
Compared to the unpredictable attacks of swordsmen like Arlong or Professor Ingurdel, the lightning bolt, though fast, was foreseeable.
Yi-Han anticipated its trajectory just before it was launched and skillfully ducked, avoiding the lightning bolt completely.
The bolt whizzed past Yi-Han and struck the wall, fizzling out with a crackling noise.
Professor Boladi nodded slightly as if to say, 'That's it.'
"Don't use magic to block it."
"Just dodge it?"
"Yes."
Without giving Yi-Han a chance to retort, Boladi launched his next attack, increasing the number of lightning bolts.
Yi-Han, while dodging, marveled at his own agility.
'Have I always been this good at dodging?'
The rigorous training he had undergone at the magic academy had remarkably enhanced his evasive skills.
After several minutes of relentless attacks, which Yi-Han adeptly avoided, Professor Boladi spoke as if he had anticipated this.
"Indeed, you handle it with ease."
'...Should I have pretended to be clumsy?'
Yi-Han regretted showing proficiency too readily in tasks set by the professor. It usually brought no good.
However, Professor Boladi was a difficult one to deceive.
How could one feign incompetence against a genuinely earnest attack?
Suddenly, the classroom darkened, leaving only Professor Boladi's eyes visible in the near-total darkness.
'Dark conditions? Typical of the Professor.'
Yi-Han wasn't surprised.
As Professor Boladi enjoyed preparing for all kinds of combat situations, it was natural for him to test evading attacks in darkness.
Yet, Yi-Han still underestimated Professor Boladi.
"What's this?" Yi-Han asked as Boladi threw him a handkerchief.
"Cover your eyes."
Yi-Han approached Professor Boladi to cover his eyes, but the professor spoke again in an emotionless, detached tone.
"Not my eyes, yours."
Yi-Han was astonished to realize he actually had to blindfold himself.
"...Professor, it's already dark. Do I really need to cover my eyes? Wouldn't it make dodging more difficult?"
"You can do it."
Professor Boladi gestured dismissively, indicating he would entertain no further discussion. The handkerchief smoothly rose and covered Yi-Han's eyes.
A world of absolute darkness enveloped him.
Then, the sound of sparking. A lightning bolt was generated.
'This is madness.'
Yi-Han felt a creeping sense of fear.
But he couldn't just stand still in fear.
Just like detecting magic traps or a mage's mana, Yi-Han focused on sensing the location of the lightning bolts around him.
He wasn't sure how effective it would be, but he had no other choice.
Professor Boladi crossed his arms, watching Yi-Han intently.
As Professor Garcia had acknowledged (at least in Boladi's view), Professor Boladi held unwavering confidence in his teaching methods.
'If the students can't keep up, that's their problem, not mine.'
It wasn't without reason that the skull principal was close to Professor Boladi.
Unfortunately for Yi-Han, his encounter with Professor Boladi only reinforced the professor's conviction.
'The basics of elemental shape transformation and control are solidly established.'
When Boladi saw Yi-Han using lightning magic, he didn't show it, but he was very pleased.
The difficulty level of the lightning element was among the highest.
Using it meant Yi-Han could smoothly advance to more complex stages of elemental shape transformation and control training.
Originally, Boladi intended to start with lightning magic...
...but he had a reason for conducting elemental detection training. It was based on the skull principal's testimony.
When Boladi heard that Yi-Han had injured his arm fighting an undead summon, he was shocked.
It was unbelievable that Yi-Han would make such a mistake.
Of course, the question should have been 'Why is a freshman fighting a giant undead summon?' But Boladi failed to consider this aspect.
'If I were that boy from the Wardanaz family...'
For the first time, after stopping Yi-Han from adding a rotational attribute to his water element magic, Boladi tried to see things from Yi-Han's perspective.
Once he started to empathize, it wasn't difficult. Putting himself in Yi-Han's shoes, Boladi quickly came to a conclusion.
'If I were the boy from the Wardanaz family, right now, I would most want to learn the art of evasion, not just attack and defense.'
Professor Boladi could have simply asked Yi-Han, but he chose not to, preferring to think and conclude on his own.
In magic combat, evasion was a skill distinct from attack and defense, and in some ways, more advanced and difficult.
The key to evasion was perception.
Understanding where and how an enemy's attack was coming from, and instantly grasping the nature and structure of the magic, was essential for smooth evasion.
'The fool blocks, but the wise evade.'
Such sayings didn't exist for no reason.
Then, how could one enhance this perceptive ability?
In truth, the boy from the Wardanaz family had been unknowingly training himself.
Regularly engaging with and discerning magic would inevitably improve one's perceptive skills.
Today, Professor Boladi had focused solely on detection, excluding control and shape.
As a result...
With a snap, Professor Boladi dispelled the lightning bolts that had appeared in the darkness.
Yi-Han was panting heavily. No matter how fit one was, not feeling exhausted in such circumstances would be more unusual.
Remarkably, the boy from the Wardanaz family had perfectly evaded every attack.
In complete darkness, where he could see nothing!
Yi-Han couldn't see it, but Professor Boladi was smiling.
When he first heard other mages speak of the 'joy of teaching', he had wondered what they meant. But now, he seemed to understand.
Teaching was truly enjoyable.
In the air, there were now far more lightning bolts and small flames, along with water orbs and compressed air, among other elements.
Even blindfolded, Yi-Han sensed something ominous and called out urgently.
"Professor? Professor???"



Chapter 107
Although his vision was obscured, Yi-Han was acutely aware of what was transpiring around him. He wanted to deny it, but the sensations throughout his body were undeniable. Professor Boladi, he realized, was summoning elements beyond just lightning.
‘It must mean that…’ Yi-Han thought.
Remarkably, even with his sight hindered, Yi-Han's ability to dodge the lightning was an impressive feat. While he was preoccupied with evasion, it was clear that something significant must be happening for Professor Boladi to smile in such circumstances.
Normally, evading lightning by reading its trajectory was challenging even with open eyes, a skill honed through swordsmanship training and innate mana sensing abilities. Without either of these, it would have been impossible.
But when Yi-Han easily mastered this, Professor Boladi nonchalantly escalated the difficulty. If Professor Garcia had witnessed this, he would have been alarmed, exclaiming, "What are you doing!?"
Yi-Han faced a virtually impossible task, navigating in complete darkness. Yet, the problem was that he executed it flawlessly. Seeing this, Professor Boladi again effortlessly raised the difficulty level.
Both mentor and student were relentless in pushing boundaries. Consequently, on his first day of elemental detection training, Yi-Han endured an incredibly challenging ordeal. In a way, it was a situation of his own making.
‘Are the other elements a deception?’
Oblivious to the trap he had set for himself, Yi-Han concentrated solely on the task. He sensed not just lightning but other elemental energies. There was no room for distraction.
Professor Boladi must have had a reason to introduce other elements in such a situation. A trick!
Yi-Han had evaded the lightning in the invisible space by relying solely on his raw mana sensing abilities, as his vision was impeded. The lightning bolts, though seemingly simple in their straight trajectory, underwent numerous changes in a brief moment. Realizing that magic briefly condensed before releasing the bolts, Yi-Han anticipated this and evaded them.
But now, with other elemental energies intermingling, he had to distinguish between them, detecting the precursor signs and identifying the lightning among them. Moreover, considering Professor Boladi's unpredictable nature, other elements prepared as decoys might also join the attack, necessitating vigilance.
‘Can I do it?’
Yi-Han lifted his head towards the elemental energies exuding presence in the darkness. It seemed impossible.
Then he resolved, ‘I'll try to get hurt as little as possible!’
Yi-Han's expectations were proven wrong.
Incredibly, he succeeded once again.
"..."
Even Professor Boladi, who usually had something to say, was momentarily silenced in astonishment.
‘He's truly gifted.’
The boy from the Wardanaz family possessed more than immense mana. In hindsight, being born with such colossal mana, learning to handle and cast spells was a formidable challenge.
Especially for a freshman.
The boy from the Wardanaz family, modest in nature, thought he wasn't particularly adept at learning magic. While he was indeed fast, compared to the prodigious young mages of the empire, he felt slightly inferior.
However, this assessment didn't account for the sheer volume of mana he possessed.
Possessing such immense mana and learning magic at that speed was itself a testament to his talent. Though usually, it was difficult to notice due to the sheer magnitude of his mana, it was a different story when it came to him detecting the mana around him. In areas where there was no penalty due to the amount of mana, the fragments of talent were bound to emerge.
With a snap, Professor Boladi made the blindfold covering Yi-Han's eyes disappear. Despite having accomplished such a remarkable feat, the boy from the Wardanaz family remained calm, and the professor did not comment further.
"I didn't expect you to pass everything on the first day."
"...Maybe it's because you gave me the tasks all at once, Professor."
Yi-Han politely implied, ‘So maybe take it easy from now on.’ But subtlety often went unnoticed by the professors.
"There's no need to thank me."
"?!"
Yi-Han was momentarily puzzled. He then belatedly realized that Professor Boladi had interpreted his words as gratitude for giving him all the tasks at once, which allowed him to pass them.
‘...This is driving me crazy.’
While Yi-Han was grappling with frustration, Professor Boladi continued, "Originally, I planned to take more time with the elemental detection training. But it seems that won't be necessary."
Yi-Han was relieved. From the professor's words, it seemed that today's lecture had concluded. Professor Boladi handed him a cloth-wrapped bundle.
"You look tired."
"!"
Yi-Han was startled. He was indeed tired from dodging lightning with his eyes open and then closed, but he had never imagined that Professor Boladi would show concern.
"What's this?"
Initially, he suspected a trap in the bundle, but Professor Boladi was not a malicious person like the skull principal.
Cautiously, Yi-Han unwrapped the package.
"Is it some kind of medicine?"
Inside was a book on magic. Professor Boladi nodded, saying, "It's a book on basic lightning magic and its applications. Study it before the next class."
"..."
Professor Boladi was not a malicious person like the skull principal. He was just a bit crazy.
Yi-Han belatedly understood the meaning behind Boladi's comment about him looking tired. It was simply an innocent observation.
The comment and the bundle were unrelated!
"...Understood."
Yi-Han managed his expression and took the magic book.
He would have to go somewhere far from the professor to express his frustration.
‘Now that I think about it, isn't this week the paper exam week?’
He realized that the magic Professor Boladi had asked him to learn wasn't the important part. Professor Boladi might not give a test, but the other classes would.
-■■■!
Yi-Han turned his head towards the eerie howls of summoned creatures coming from outside the classroom, in the front yard of the main building.
"What's going on out there?"
"The professors are dealing with escaped summons."
"??"
Yi-Han was perplexed. Weren't the professors the ones who ignored the escaped summons roaming the academy just last week?
"Why all of a sudden?"
"Probably to prevent them from interfering with the exams."
"..."
Yi-Han, at a loss for words, politely excused himself and left the classroom.
"I shouldn't have asked..."
The book Professor Boladi gave him, &lt;Basic Lightning Element Magic and Its Applications&gt;, turned out to be better than he had expected.
‘Wait. Who wrote this?’
When considering that most spellbooks paid little heed to the fact that they were being read by freshmen, &lt;Basic Lightning Element Magic and Its Applications&gt; was indeed remarkably user-friendly.
It didn't merely describe the incantations and motions for the 1st circle spell &lt;Lightning Creation&gt;. Unlike other 1st circle elemental spells, maintaining the position of the lightning element after its creation was notably challenging. The most common mistake novice mages made was losing control of the summoned lightning element and scattering it in random directions. To prevent this, the book advised certain preparations: wear thick clothing that doesn't conduct lightning well and practice when no one else is around...
Yi-Han, intrigued by the author's approach, checked the back of the book for other works by the same mage, only to find no author's name listed.
"A book written within the magic academy?"
Most books in the empire were not systematically mass-produced. Many were hand-written by individuals and passed down.
This was even more true for books within the magic academy.
In the library, the books were often haphazardly categorized, with more than half being so indecipherable that it was impossible to understand what was written.
Mages typically only cared about their own satisfaction, rarely considering others!
"If I were a bookstore owner, I would clear out such books."
Despite his animosity towards Professor Boladi, Yi-Han thought he should read more of this book.
After all, it wasn't the book's fault.
And in the next class, Professor Boladi would surely proceed with the assumption that Yi-Han had mastered this book...
"Hello, Wardanaz!"
Startled by the cheerful voice of a professor approaching from behind, Yi-Han realized this was never a good sign.
Fortunately, the professor was a familiar face. It was Professor Kirmin Ku, one of the few friends of Professor Boladi.
"Are you off to the &lt;Basic Magic Understanding&gt; class? Right?"
"Yes."
"Great! I'm headed to the lecture hall myself. We can go together."
Professor Kirmin, unlike Boladi, was incredibly cheerful, almost unbelievably so for being friends with him.
Yi-Han felt a glimmer of hope at this.
Young, amiable professors with good social skills often meant a higher likelihood of treating students well.
Of course, whether this rule applied in a magic academy was another matter...
"Do you teach illusion magic?"
"Yes. Professor Bagrak doesn't like illusion magic, but it has many practical uses."
Each field of magic, when delved into deeply, revealed an almost infinite expanse of possibilities.
From casting barrier spells to prevent intruders into a territory to creating hallucinations for enemies, these were just aspects of illusion magic.
There were mages who combined it with space magic to create bizarre labyrinths of illusion that couldn't exist in reality, and others who merged it with mental magic to incapacitate foes with a mere glance.
Hearing this, Yi-Han thought to himself.
‘Perfect for thievery.’
Using illusions to evade detection or to dismantle existing illusion spells.
No matter how kindly Kirmin explained, it was hard not to think of other uses.
"Wardanaz, last time I saw you, I could tell you have a talent for illusion magic."
Yi-Han was delighted at Kirmin's words.
Usually, when a professor said something like, "You have talent," caution was warranted.
Letting your guard down could mean being pulled under a professor's wing and becoming their forced apprentice.
But for Yi-Han, such worries were already too late. From the moment he entered the magic academy, he was destined to learn under the professors.
Finding a kind and decent professor was crucial.
And Professor Kirmin might just be that kind and decent professor, although Yi-Han couldn't be certain yet...
‘Illusion magic isn't bad. If you master anything well, can't you make a living anywhere?’
"Illusion magic requires something more important than abundant mana, exceptional elemental affinity, or extraordinary calculation skills. It's about precise control. From what I see, Wardanaz, you have a natural talent for it."
"...???"
Yi-Han was taken aback.
What did he mean? Yi-Han, whose immense mana often meant a lack of fine control?
‘Could he be mistaken because of the assignment submission last time?’
That was more about what he had practiced to exhaustion under Professor Boladi, not about any exceptional talent of his own.
"Th... Thank you."
"I'm curious if you have any particular field of magic you're interested in. Often, talented freshmen like you don't settle on just one area but explore several."
"I haven't decided yet."
Professor Kirmin then changed his question.
"So... besides Professor Bagrak, have you met any other professors outside of class time?"
This wasn't about what areas Yi-Han was interested in, but rather, which professors were interested in Yi-Han.
Choosing a mentor was not just a student's prerogative; teachers also chose their students.
"So far, Professor Uregor..."
"Aha. Alchemy."
"Professor Bungaegor."
"Zoology."
"And Professor Willow."
"Botany."
"Professor Mortum as well..."
"Dark Magic, is it?"
"And Professor Millei."
"Summoning magic. Wait. Hold on."
Professor Kirmin paused.
It was an overwhelming list.



Chapter 108
Professor Kirmin, seeking to soothe his confusion, posed another question.
"What discussions have you had with Professor Uregor?"
"We usually talk about organizing materials in the cabin and what to grow in the garden."
Listening, Professor Kirmin hummed in acknowledgment.
It was clear that Professor Uregor held the Wardanaz family's boy in high regard.
Alchemists do not easily open their cabins to others.
Moreover, Professor Kirmin remembered seeing a few students from the Blue Dragon carrying reagents used in Professor Uregor's lab.
It was likely that the boy of the Wardanaz family shared what he received from Professor Uregor with his friends.
'Professor Uregor must regard Wardanaz as an alchemy apprentice.'
"And with Professor Bungaegor?"
"I am learning about the animals living near the magic academy and studying how to handle them."
'...Does Professor Bungaegor think similarly...?'
Professor Kirmin observed the staff in Yi-Han's hand.
It was a staff imbued with a strong life force, inhabited by a tree spirit.
Only Professor Willow could give such a staff.
'Professor Willow too?'
Thud!
The cumbersome sound of Yi-Han's leopard bone summon, tied to his belt, jumping down was heard.
Yi-Han sternly, like scolding a pet, said, "Bad dog! Come back right now!"
The incomplete leopard bone summon whined and returned.
Professor Kirmin couldn't immediately grasp what had happened.
"I'm sorry. Lately, this bone summon doesn't listen well."
"Is that summon by any chance...?"
"Ah. You know? Professor Mortum gave it to me."
"..."
Dark Magic too!
Professor Kirmin, astounded, counted on his fingers internally.
It was unclear how many professors had initiated contact first.
The absurdity aside, another question arose.
'With so many professors seeking him out, why on earth does he study with Bagrak?'
No matter how he thought about it, there seemed little reason for a student to want to learn from Bagrak...
"Professor?"
"Ah. Sorry. I was momentarily distracted by the summon. Its disobedience is due to its growing strength."
"Should I then instill fear to make it obey?"
"Undead hardly ever fear anything. It's futile."
"?!"
Yi-Han was puzzled.
Then what about the undead summons in Professor Mortum's &lt;Darkness Chamber&gt;, trembling at the sight of Yi-Han?
'Hmm. It seems he is not well-informed about other fields.'
Professors were surprisingly ignorant about fields outside their own. Yi-Han wasn't surprised.
"There's no need to be too anxious. A strong summon means high intelligence. It's just growing stronger and won't listen now, but once it matures, its mind will also develop, and it will obey. ...But why are there so few of the… bones?"
"Professor Mortum told me to look around the academy for them."
"Ah..."
Professor Kirmin nodded.
It was just the kind of thing Professor Mortum would think of.
"Rather than just giving, he wanted to offer the student a challenge. Right?"
"Ah... Yes. Well."
Yi-Han nodded.
Professor Kirmin was evidently skilled in social interactions. Professor Boladi would have said, 'Such needless antics.'
"But that Sharakan is indeed a rare and precious monster."
"...Wasn't it a leopard?"
"Oops."
Professor Kirmin paused abruptly.
It appeared that he had inadvertently revealed a gift Professor Mortum had prepared to surprise the students (although whether the students would appreciate it was another matter).
"Of course, it's a leopard. A leopard."
"..."
Yi-Han was not easily deceived by such statements.
Once the class was over, he planned to scour the library to find out exactly what kind of monster a Sharakan was.
'Wasn't it just an ordinary leopard?'
Could it possibly be some undead monster that kills its master?
Feeling Yi-Han's gaze, the leopard bone summon wagged its bones excitedly. For now, Yi-Han stroked its head.
...Treating it kindly now might prevent it from turning on its master, even after it grew stronger.
"Anyway, it seems Professor Mortum is quite fond of you, Wardanaz."
"All students are dear to Professor Mortum."
Yi-Han was sincere.
Given that there were no students eager to learn dark magic, Professor Mortum showed favor even to those like Gainando.
How else could a knight who came to learn dark magic to hunt dark mages attend the lectures so diligently?
"A mage doesn't favor a talentless disciple. No matter how kind they might be."
Professor Kirmin counted again the professors mentioned in the conversation.
Including those not mentioned, there were many.
At this point, he was concerned for the health of the Wardanaz boy.
With so many professors already imparting their teachings, it was unlikely they would step back easily, and Wardanaz was likely to be pulled into all their classes.
Especially with the mental and physical fatigue already caused by Professor Bagrak...
Was he really okay?
'Hmm. This is troubling.'
Professor Kirmin was torn between wanting to take in a talented disciple and worrying about burdening an already overworked student.
Finally, his internal scales tipped in favor of the former.
"Wardanaz, if it's okay with you..."
"Actually, I've also met separately with the principal."
"With Gonadaltes? What did you discuss?"
"I received a magic book. Could you please check if it's alright?"
Yi-Han hoped to use the seemingly kind-hearted Professor Kirmin's help to investigate the potentially evil magic book given by the principal.
However, the plan backfired.
Professor Kirmin looked at Yi-Han in horror.
Caught by the most insane person in the academy.
"...That must be difficult. But hang in there!"
"???"
As Professor Kirmin placed a hand on Yi-Han's shoulder and offered words of encouragement, Yi-Han was slightly taken aback.
There was something odd about the nuance in his voice.
It was somewhat... similar to the sympathetic tone a senior would use when saying 'hang in there!' when Yi-Han was assigned to work under a professor.
"Thank you, Professor. But, I have a question about illusion magic. I'm not sure if I can do it well..."
"Wardanaz. You don't need to learn illusion magic."
"?!?!"
Yi-Han was once more surprised by Professor Kirmin's abrupt change in attitude.
'Why is he acting like this?'
'Hang in there, Wardanaz. I'll be cheering for you.'
Yi-Han thought the students of this magic academy were somewhat unresponsive.
Despite their young age, they were treated as adults and had matured significantly, having grown up in various statuses and backgrounds.
This was evident in the &lt;Basic Magic Understanding&gt; class. He remembered how unimpressed the students were when Professor Mortum entered the classroom.
Of course, the reaction was different during the summoning magic class, but that was an exception.
But then...
"Professor, there's always an illusion magic on the stairs I need to use, and I can't get through. Is there a way to dispel or break through it?"
"Can an illusion be cast on black bread to make it seem like it's covered in honey?"
"I'd like to set up an illusion-based intruder barrier in the lounge. Could Wardanaz, or rather, another first-year, break through it?"
It turned out that it was only dark magic that was particularly unpopular.
The students generally showed strong interest in most fields of magic. Questions about illusion magic had already come up five times.
Professor Kirmin waved his hands as if to calm the crowd.
"Now, now. If I were to answer every question, we'd run out of time in a day. Let's stop here with the questions and have a brief experience of what illusion magic is like."
After finishing his words, Professor Kirmin stood still.
As an unexpected silence continued, the students grew uneasy. Gainando whispered, "Why is he doing that?"
Yi-Han stared intently at Professor Kirmin, then began to sense something was off.
'Could it be an illusion?'
If that were true, it was astonishing.
Since entering the classroom with Yi-Han and speaking with Professor Garcia, there had been no opportunity for a switch, yet he had deceived the students' eyes and ears, replacing the real him with an illusion.
As Yi-Han started to perceive this strangeness, his surroundings suddenly felt different.
Like when he first grasped the movement of the lightning element in Professor Boladi's ‘near-fatal’ lecture, and since then, could always perceive it...
In magic, enlightenment was an inspiration that showed a different world. Yi-Han realized that there was an invisible person standing in front of his and Gainando's desks.
"Gainando. There's a professor in front of you."
"What?! Paralyze!"
Gainando, startled, immediately cast a curse. His prowess in dark magic was not without reason.
Of course, Professor Kirmin was not someone to be felled by a first-year's curse. He returned the curse with a look of disbelief.
Pop!
Gainando was hit with a &lt;Lesser Paralysis Curse&gt; and stiffened up, falling to the side.
"Finding me was good, but you shouldn't just cast a curse like that!"
"I'm sorry, Professor."
Yi-Han apologized on his behalf. Gainando had become rigid.
'But does Gainando really have talent in dark magic?'
Normally, it's difficult to paralyze even a single body part, let alone to immobilize the whole body, even if it was self-inflicted.
It was a talent indeed.
Professor Kirmin switched places with his original illusion. Gainando silently screamed for the paralysis curse to be lifted.
"As you just saw, I sneaked in unnoticed. This is what illusion magic can do: becoming invisible, detecting others hidden in invisibility, creating illusions to confuse enemies."
Professor Kirmin, from his actions to his demeanor, was indeed a flamboyant person. The students were already captivated.
Yi-Han's heart sank again, remembering Professor Mortum's dark magic.
"But of course, you freshmen need to start with the basics, right? A great mage possesses keen observational skills. Look at the students next to you and see if anything has changed. Noticing a sense of incongruity is the first step in recognizing an illusion."
Once again, Professor Kirmin cast illusions around the classroom without the students noticing.
The students were shocked to realize that something about their friends, whom they had been seeing every day, had slightly changed.
"Wait. You weren't this skinny when you enrolled."
"It's because I haven't been eating, dummy."
Though there were initial struggles, students from each tower gradually began to detect the illusions.
Professor Kirmin praised these perceptive students and imparted further teachings.
"If you can detect incongruities with just your keen eyesight, then you're ready to learn the &lt;Lesser Illusion Dispel&gt; magic. Try dispelling the illusion here."
Yi-Han, along with other students, stepped forward and observed the illusion.
An illusion of a locked wooden box was placed in front of the students.
A student from the Black Tortoise, following Professor Kirmin's instructions, recited a spell and waved their staff. The wooden box let out a piercing scream.
"!!!!"
"Don't let your guard down when dispelling illusion magic. The presence of one illusion often means there are various other safeguards around."
Professor Kirmin advised the student and then turned his gaze to Yi-Han.
Yi-Han held his staff and aimed at the illusion on the wooden box.
He first recognized the illusion clearly, visualized what the reality might be, and then, with a spell, swung his staff.
"Begone, illusion!"
The illusion on the wooden box vanished. The princess standing nearby softly clapped her hands.
However, Professor Kirmin, instead of offering praise, looked at Yi-Han with a sympathetic gaze and said, "Wardanaz, you don't need to force yourself to practice illusion magic so diligently."
"...?!"



Chapter 109
Yi-Han was taken aback.
This was a reaction that was unlike any other among the reactions of professors that Yi-Han knew.
'What did I do wrong?'
But no matter how much he pondered, there seemed to be no mistake on Yi-Han's part.
'Is it because of my excessive mana?'
Yi-Han cautiously inquired.
"Is it difficult for me to learn illusion magic because of my excessive mana?"
"No?"
"Then, is it because my control is lacking?"
"No. That's sufficient. Well... Alright. I should tell you."
Professor Kirmin, after some contemplation, decided to confide in Yi-Han.
"Wardanaz. Right now, you have..."
Yi-Han tensed up.
When the professor spoke so seriously, it usually indicated a serious issue.
Like when Professor Garcia diagnosed Yi-Han with incurable mana overflow upon his admission...
"There are too many professors interested in you."
"..."
Yi-Han was dumbfounded.
He knew about mana overflow, but was there such a thing as professor overflow?
'The latter seems much more critical.'
While one could somehow live with the former, the latter seemed life-threatening.
"Why would that be..."
"Think about it. It would be too hard for you to learn illusion magic while at the same time studying under all those professors, wouldn't it?"
'Ah.'
Yi-Han understood Professor Kirmin's point.
And he was moved.
With those words, Professor Kirmin could claim a place among the top 1% of professors at the academy in terms of character.
He seemed worthy of a position next to Professor Garcia.
"No, I cannot."
Yi-Han spoke firmly.
He couldn't miss attending lectures by such a professor, even if it meant avoiding other magic subjects.
He must forge a connection now!
Failing to attend now could lead to regret later, should unforeseen circumstances arise.
Even the kindest professor is still a professor.
Approaching later with 'Professor, I wish to attend your class now' could be met with 'Sorry, there's no room left.'
"I can attend, Professor. I am prepared."
Yi-Han's eyes blazed with passion. Professor Kirmin was taken aback by his resolute expression.
He hadn't expected such fervor.
His sculpted face shone with determination, casting an even stronger impression.
"It will be tough."
"It's alright."
"Alright then. Join from the next session."
Professor Kirmin patted Yi-Han's shoulder.
A passionate student always brought joy to a teacher.
With talent like Wardanaz, it was even better.
"Be careful, it will be tough."
"Yes. And don't worry too much. If I don't increase my classes further, it should be manageable, right?"
"..."
Professor Kirmin looked at Yi-Han with a complex expression.
His gaze was like that of a mage foreseeing a tragic fate, but unfortunately, Yi-Han failed to notice.
As Professor Kirmin concluded the class and left, the students prepared to rise from their seats.
During the week's lectures, only the angel, or rather, troll mixed-blood, Professor Garcia, didn't torment the students with assignments.
However, with a regretful expression, Professor Garcia announced.
"Everyone, please wait. There's a test this week."
"..."
"..."
The students looked at Professor Garcia as if they were hurt and betrayed, but Garcia, though apologetic, stood firm.
"So, everyone had better be prepared."
"What will be on the exam?"
At a student's question, Professor Garcia nodded and responded.
For a month, we learned the basics of magic and explored various fields of magic. I intend to ask how well you have learned about these."
"Ah... but Professor! I don't know much about dark magic..."
"Will you also ask about summoning magic?"
The students murmured among themselves.
Most students who had joined here had clear preferences.
Those who had a specific type of magic in mind often showed little interest in other areas.
Professor Garcia reassured them, as if to calm their worries.
"Everyone, relax. The questions will be tailored to each student. I won't ask about areas that don't align with your aptitudes or interests."
Sighs of relief escaped from various corners.
Yi-Han, who had been relaxing with his friends, suddenly paused.
'Wait a minute.'
Upon reflection, Yi-Han realized he had participated in all the fields of magic covered in Professor Garcia's lectures.
...Wait?
Does that mean...
'Do I have to prepare for everything?'
For the first time since entering the academy, Yi-Han tasted true fear.
Tuesday.
The &lt;Basic Riding Training&gt; lecture was held in a field a bit farther than usual.
Professor Bungaegor, with a lit pipe, awaited the students.
"Look at that!"
"So cute!"
Exclamations burst among the students.
Behind Professor Bungaegor were baby bears.
Their round and adorable appearance made them look so cute that one could forget how they'd look when fully grown.
The students, worn out from classes, showed age-appropriate expressions upon seeing the baby bears.
"Professor really thought about us."
"Yeah. We deserve a break like this."
After weeks of assignments and lectures, and now a test.
It seemed fair to spend at least one lecture rolling around in the fields without punishment.
And unlike the previous burning puppies, these baby bears looked completely harmless. A definite break.
"Are you all here?"
"Yes!"
The students responded in unison, their voices twice as bright and cheerful as usual.
"Good. Now that you're here, let's have a test. Bring your horses."
"?"
"????"
The students were bewildered by Professor Bungaegor's words.
"What about the baby bears?"
"The baby bears?"
Professor Bungaegor removed her pipe and turned her head back, then spoke as if realizing something.
"Ah. Those baby bears aren't for today's lecture. A friend asked me to look after them for a while."
"..."
The students felt more disappointed than when they met the skull principal. Professor Bungaegor laughed heartily.
"If you want to play with baby bears, wait a few decades until you retire. Now, bring your horses! Let's see how well you've bonded with them!"
"But we're not ready yet, can we do it next time..."
"Beasts don't wait for you. Will you ask a hungry beast attacking you to wait while you prepare? Move!"
The students proceeded with anxious and uneasy expressions.
Those who rarely visited the stable were naturally nervous, but even those who frequented it felt the same.
“Will it be okay?”
“Last time, my horse didn't listen and tried to run away…”
The horses in the stable were fierce and temperamental.
Even students who thought they had bonded with their horses couldn't be sure how they would react when let loose.
And Yi-Han was no exception.
'Hmm.'
It might have been his imagination, but Yi-Han thought the white horse he was responsible for seemed to have the worst temper in the stable.
The largest and most physically fit horse, its temperament was incomparable to the others.
At times, it made one wonder if it was really a horse.
'Did Professor Uregor feed it some potion?'
But if the white horse had wildness, Yi-Han had intelligence. He had found his own way to handle it.
"There."
Yi-Han immediately equipped the white horse with a mana-absorbing metal bracelet and belt. The horse snorted in displeasure, but Yi-Han was persistent.
Without them, there was no telling how the white horse might betray him.
-Puff-huff. Huff.
The white horse was cunning and intelligent.
Realizing brute strength wouldn't work against this mad freshman, it resorted to pitiful looks with its sad eyes.
However, Yi-Han was more merciless than the white horse.
"Sorry. No threat or plea can change my mind."
-Puff-huff-huff!
The white horse glared at Yi-Han, but the artifacts already strapped to its body were draining its mana.
With its energy diminished, the horse obediently followed as Yi-Han pulled the reins.
Someday, it would have its revenge!
"Amazing...!"
"That wild horse!"
Students from the White Tiger murmured as they saw Yi-Han leading out the white horse.
Initially, when Yi-Han was assigned the most ferocious horse in the stable, everyone mocked him, thinking he couldn't tame it.
But now, the white horse was unbelievably docile, following Yi-Han as if it had been with him for a long time.
The noble bearing of the white horse suited the boy of the Wardanaz family.
Anglago unwittingly spoke.
"Wardanaz really is remarkable."
"...Has Anglago lost his mind?? Why suddenly?"
"Was he enchanted by some magic on the island?"
"No, no. It's not about liking that Wardanaz guy, just acknowledging his abilities!"
Anglago hastily explained as his friends looked at him in shock.
"Anglago, you're weird. Not even badmouthing Wardanaz."
"Maybe Wardanaz really did something to him..."
"I said no! I dislike Wardanaz! I do!"
Meanwhile, not only Yi-Han but also other students cautiously started leading their horses outside.
It seemed that students from the Black Tortoise, who had diligently cared for their horses, were numerous.
There were quite a few from the Immortal Phoenix and the White Tiger as well...
The Blue Dragon students were the fewest.
Yi-Han felt embarrassed for his friends.
'Such lazy fellows.'
No wonder the Tutanta family's Salko despised the nobles.
Their laziness deserved as much scorn.
Professor Bungaegor placed a sundial on a rock and announced.
"If you've brought out your horse, follow the path. You'll come across a river; water the horses there and return for a pass."
Covered in mud, Gainando whispered.
"Couldn't we just water them at the well and return without her knowing?"
"Listen. If someone lies about watering their horse at the river, I'll throw them into the river."
"..."
Gainando quietly shook the mud off his hair.
"Alright, then start!"
Professor Bungaegor tapped her pipe and shouted.
The students, scattered disorderly across the field, began leading their horses down the path.
The princess elegantly mounted her horse, followed slowly by her admirers.
A few other students, having grown quite close to their horses, also rode them along the path. Their peers looked on enviously.
Yonaire could have mounted a horse too. But instead of doing so, she looked at Yi-Han.
Yi-Han was about to lead his horse by the reins.
"Aren't you riding?"
"I might get tired if I do."
-Puff!
Instead of appreciating Yi-Han's consideration, the white horse whinnied in protest, pleading for the removal of its bracelet and belt.
Yi-Han ignored it.
'Walking is safer.'
While absorbing its mana calmed the horse, it also risked weakening its stamina.
If he rode it and the horse collapsed, it would be a disaster. Yi-Han decided to walk alongside it.
Yonaire shrugged and grasped her horse's reins.
"Yonaire. You could ride if you want."
"I'm also worried the horse might get tired."
Yonaire's dark-haired horse nuzzled her with a grateful whinny.
Yonaire laughed, tickled by the affection. Yi-Han suddenly felt a bit sad.
'Why can't I bond with spirits or horses...'
"And we're friends, right?"
"Thank you."
Yi-Han spoke sincerely.
Bang!
Behind them, Gainando was catapulted out of the stable and rolled on the ground. He had been flung by a horse he wasn't close to, trying to force it out.
Mud-covered Gainando shouted.
"Guys! Wait! You'll wait for me, right? We're friends!"
"Shall we start?"
"Yes."
Yi-Han and Yonaire departed without hesitation.
Friendship meant sharing stable chores in the morning.



Chapter 110
Yonaire and Yi-Han, who chose to walk instead of ride horses, realized belatedly that their pace was not as slow as they had thought. The students who rode ahead were actually meandering more than expected.
"Whoa…whoa!" Starting with a student from the White Tiger performing tricks atop a jumping horse...
Klak klak klak klak!
"Why are you coming back?"
"I don't know! I'm not controlling this! Help!!"
And so, horses were seen running in the opposite direction. Yi-Han was surprisingly pleased to discover that walking while holding the reins was an effective method.
Snort.
The white horse, amidst the chaos of the other horses, snorted as if disappointed. It wanted to gallop wildly with Yi-Han on its back but was too drained to do so. Yi-Han rummaged in his pocket and pulled out a sugar cube, offering it to the white horse on his palm.
Snort!
The white horse, usually quite temperamental, always ceased its dislike for Yi-Han when offered a snack. Yi-Han inwardly cursed the horse, 'Such a calculating creature.'
Yonaire, on the other hand, seemed to have truly bonded with his dark brown horse, which remained gentle and affectionate even without treats, seemingly concerned about Yonaire's fatigue.
“Wardanaz!” Loud, gravelly voice was heard from behind. It was Salko of the Tutanta family and his friends.
"What's going on? Wait. Don't come closer."
"?"
Yi-Han prevented Salko and his friends from approaching.
"You might mess up my test."
"...No way!! Wardanaz, what do you take us for!"
Salko's subordinates were enraged. Unlike Yi-Han, they were not fixated on grades. They were earnestly preparing for the test to prove their efforts, not for grades.
"Everyone says that. So stay back."
"Calm down, everyone."
Salko restrained his friends and said, "It's a rule not to rummage through your backpack near the gold mine. With Wardanaz's brilliance, he attracts much jealousy. There must be many rivals even within the Tower of the Blue Dragon. I can understand such a reaction."
"?" Yonaire was puzzled.
That's not it?
"I won't approach any further. Wardanaz."
"Alright. Tutanta. What is it?"
Before Salko could speak, one of his subordinates angrily interjected, "Think about what you've done, Wardanaz!"
Yi-Han hesitated for a moment. There were too many things to choose from. Yi-Han asked seriously, "I'm not sure. What are you referring to?"
"What did you just feed that horse?"
"Sugar cubes."
"That's it! You shouldn't feed that to a horse! You should have brought it to the black market!"
"..."
Snort!
Yi-Han and the white horse shared a moment of mutual astonishment.
Salko coughed awkwardly for the first time.
"No, Wardanaz."
"Wasn't it?"
"Yes. That can't be the reason."
Salko then handed Yi-Han a bundle wrapped in brown paper. A glimpse of its contents was visible. It was a carrot.
"Carrots are just as good. Sugar is a rare commodity, so use carrots instead."
With that, Salko turned away. Yi-Han called out to his sturdy dwarven, no, elven friend, "Tutanta. Thank you."
"It's nothing. Come to the black market next time."
"Sure. It's not difficult."
"Let's play a game of chess before you go."
Yi-Han gazed at Salko with suspicion, but Salko had already turned his back and departed.
"Well... it's not bad to save sugar, I suppose."
Although he still had ample supplies, sugar was indeed a precious commodity. Replacing it with carrots wasn't a bad idea. Yi-Han offered a carrot to the white horse.
Snort!
The white horse turned its head away, clearly disliking the carrot. Yi-Han seriously considered finding another white horse.
'Maybe there's one at the magic academy...'
If he feed it well and grow it, wouldn't it look somewhat similar?
Yi-Han and Yonaire caught sight of the riverbank in the distance. Several students were already leading their horses to the river.
Rowena of the White Tiger, a follower of the princess, spotted Yi-Han and warned him, "Mr. Wardanaz, be cautious."
"What's the matter?"
Instead of replying, Rowena pointed at the river with a wooden sword. As a student neared the river to let his horse drink, something astonishing happened. The water level dramatically dropped.
"..."
"..."
Yi-Han and Yonaire's expressions soured.
This is too much!
"Did you find a solution?"
"I was considering going deeper, but the current seems too strong..." Rowena looked hesitant.
Rivers were not to be underestimated. Even water up to one's waist could cause drowning if balance was lost, and the danger increased with the speed of the water. Especially this river, which seemed deep enough to reach one's chest. In such an uncertain situation, caution was imperative.
As Yi-Han approached, the princess rushed over. Rowena spoke on her behalf, "The princess is pleased to see Mr. Wardanaz."
"It seems she just walked here...?"
The princess intently observed the brown bundle Yi-Han was carrying.
'Does she want to feed the horse a carrot?'
Yi-Han took out a carrot and offered it. The princess bit into it immediately, grimacing and then looking at Yi-Han with a sense of betrayal. Yi-Han and Yonaire were the ones taken aback.
'It was meant for the horse...'
'Shh.'
As if puzzled, Rowena inquired, "Where did you get this?"
"...A friend from the Black Tortoise said it was fresh and to eat it."
"I'm sorry, but looking at the princess's face, it seems underripe..."
"That's what I thought. Probably not skilled in farming. But let's not be too harsh considering the intention."
"Yes, it's not polite to complain about a gift."
Yi-Han brazenly feigned innocence and swiftly changed the subject, "Let's try using water manipulation magic to fetch water from the river."
Swinging his staff, a massive blob of water rose from the river. Rowena couldn't help but admire.
So quick and easy!
The blob of water neared the horse's mouth. And just as its tongue was about to touch, the water evaporated.
"..."
Yi-Han was flabbergasted.
'This is really too much.'
Is the test really this serious?
No matter what magic Professor Bungaegor had cast on the river, it seemed they couldn't feed the horses unless they entered the water. In that case...
Yi-Han pulled out a long, sturdy rope from his backpack. The other students watching in a daze were startled.
'Why is that even there??'
It was surprising where he got it, but carrying it around like Wardanaz was just as perplexing. Seeing their puzzlement, Yi-Han announced, "Let's use this to tie ourselves together."
The students, realizing that tying themselves and their horses together would make it easier to withstand the strong river currents, nodded in agreement. This was a plan worth trying.
"That's a good idea, Wardanaz."
"Let's do it together."
So, the students bound themselves with ropes and entered the river with their horses.
"Careful... done!"
"We did it! We did it!"
Cheers erupted from the students who ventured deep into the river. Although the water level dropped when the horses started drinking, it wasn't low enough to prevent them from doing so. Finally, the leading horse began to gulp down water.
'What a relief.'
Yi-Han breathed a sigh of relief internally. This was an easy resolution, indeed. Let it end just like this!
Snort.
The white horse grumbled as if it didn't want to go.
"If you go and drink, I'll give you an extra sugar cube."
Purr…
At Yi-Han's words, the white horse stopped grumbling and lowered its head.
Currently, the students took turns leading at the front, and now it was Yi-Han's turn. As the white horse drank, Yi-Han suddenly felt a tingling sensation in his hair, reminiscent of the chill he had felt when he closed his eyes and detected the movement of elements during Professor Boladi's lecture, or rather, torment.
That chilling sensation! Yi-Han quickly turned his head. A ferocious surge of water was rapidly descending from upstream.
"Bungaegor!"
His friends didn't understand why Yi-Han suddenly shouted the professor's name, nor did they grasp the curse hidden within.
"Everyone, get out of the way! Shield, expand!"
After warning the students behind him, Yi-Han swung his staff and created a massive water shield. As large and thick a shield of water as possible, utilizing all nearby river water! Instantly, the water level around them dropped, allowing the students behind to quickly escape. However, Yi-Han, who had ventured the farthest, was too late to escape. The surge from upstream collided head-on with the water shield and burst sideways. Water splashed everywhere, and the river's level rose again.
But that was enough.
'I can withstand this!'
From the beginning, Yi-Han had no absurd notion of completely blocking the river with the water shield. A brief respite was all he needed. As long as the water didn't rise around him, he could escape. But then...
Snort!
The white horse fell over.
Unlike Yi-Han, who had noticed and prepared for the surge, the white horse, caught off guard, stumbled and flailed in the water that suddenly hit its ankles. Several students screamed. Yonaire, who had escaped, hurried to re-enter, but other students held her back.
"Pull the rope!"
Before Rowena could finish, the rope snapped. The violent currents on either side of Yi-Han had severed it. Now, no options remained. Rowena cried out in desperation, "Mr. Wardanaz! Escape on your own..."
"..."
The white horse was suddenly airborne. It wasn't that Yi-Han had realized a new spell and levitated the horse… Yi-Han had lifted the white horse onto his back and stood up.
The water shield wavered, precariously protecting Yi-Han's surroundings. Everyone was lost for words, even the white horse seemed baffled by Yi-Han's antics. The horse neighed as if to complain, 'What are you doing?'
"...If you throw a fit now, I'll plant you upside down in the riverbed," Yi-Han threatened in a deadly quiet, menacing voice.
To the onlookers, Yi-Han's stance appeared solemn and majestic, yet his entire body was screaming in agony. With one part of his mind, he maintained the water shield, while with another, he wildly sent out mana throughout his body.
Professor Ingurdel had warned against this, but what choice did he have? There was no other way. With each step he took, the mana draining wastefully from his body was so intense that it even frightened the white horse. It seemed inevitable that this human would collapse from exhaustion first.
Yet Yi-Han did not fall nor did he succumb to the river. Barely reaching the shallows, he carried the white horse out and gently set it down. Then, he erupted in a mix of resentment and frustration.
"Bungaegor!!"
"???"
The students were once again perplexed. They couldn't understand why Yi-Han was shouting the professor's name.
Puff…
The white horse quickly got up and rushed to Yi-Han, worried about his condition. But Yi-Han was not deceived.
"No matter how nice you act, I'm not untying your bracelet and belt."
-…-



Chapter 111
The white horse was caught off guard. Wasn't the mood supposed to be different at that moment?
There was a history of distrust between griffins and humans. Wasn't it a touching moment when human dedication was about to erase the griffin's long-standing distrust, with the griffin finally acknowledging Yi-Han as its master?
Heehee, heehee.
The white horse once again bowed its head and nuzzled against Yi-Han. Yi-Han remained unemotional.
"I told you, I won't undo either the bracelet or the belt."
......
The white horse felt a surge of anger.
No way!
Neigh! heehee!!
"Just as I thought, showing your true colors! Did you think you could fool me?" As the white horse snorted in defiance, Yi-Han retorted as if he had anticipated this reaction.
The white horse, enraged, nudged Yi-Han with its head.
No!!!
"Are you okay?!"
"I'm fine. Seems like it's angry because I touched it without permission."
"It's not about the horse talking!"
Yonaire and the students rushed over in a panic. They were worried that Yi-Han might have been seriously injured.
Rowena looked at Yi-Han incredulously. It was unbelievable that he had emerged from the raging rapids carrying the white horse.
...In such a situation, wouldn't it be better to be a knight rather than a mage?
"It's really okay, don't worry," Yi-Han said, shaking off the water.
The other students of the tower felt sorry about the sudden accident during Yi-Han's turn, but Yi-Han didn't blame them. It was Professor Bungaegor's evil and twisted scheme that was the problem.
"What... what happened?" Tutanta and friends from the Black Tortoise arrived belatedly, shocked.
Yi-Han, suppressing his anger, explained calmly, "Be careful everyone. There's a trap set by Professor Bungaegor."
"…!"
Tutanta and his friends were appalled upon hearing the explanation.
"She did that?! Even the horse’s life is at risk?"
"How excessive, even for a test!"
Unlike other professors, Professor Bungaegor was a famous adventurer in the empire. The students, who had admired her since childhood after reading her exploration stories, felt betrayed.
"Let's protest when we get back. We can't participate in such a test."
"Right. This horse is like a friend to me now. How can I put a friend's life in danger?"
Moved by the response of his friends from the Black Tortoise, Yi-Han thought, 'Perhaps the future of this academy isn't so bleak.'
Then, suddenly, Professor Bungaegor arrived, riding a thunderbird from the sky. The thunderbird, landing smoothly, hissed at Yi-Han, apparently still holding a grudge from being tricked by him before.
Professor Bungaegor, along with Nillia, dismounted from the thunderbird.
The Black Tortoise students, determined, approached and said,
"Professor, we can't participate in this test!"
"Rather than risking a friend's life, we'd accept an F..."
Instead of getting angry at the students' defiance, Professor Bungaegor nodded.
"I know. The river spirit is being capricious, right? I came to stop it. Just wait a bit."
"..."
"..."
Huh?
The students from the Black Tortoise looked at each other in confusion.
Was it not Professor Bungaegor's trap after all?
"Wasn't it prepared by you, Professor?"
"What?"
"The... rising river waters..."
"Trying to sweep away a student..."
"Why would I prepare that?! Are you insane?"
Professor Bungaegor exclaimed in disbelief.
"Why would I set up such a dangerous trap that could kill a horse?"
"That... that's how it is," acknowledged one of the students.
"Come to think of it, that's true," another agreed.
'Shouldn't the first thought be the students' potential death?'
Professor Bungaegor was known for her deep affection for animals, perhaps even more so than for his students. It was unthinkable that such a professor would send animals into a potentially dangerous situation.
"But why did you suspect me when the river spirit was acting up?" the professor questioned, puzzled.
The students felt sheepish. They realized that they had become overly distrustful of the professors, possibly due to the influence of the skull principal.
Professor Bungaegor clicked her tongue in disappointment, shaking her head, thinking, ‘The education here seems to improve the students' magic skills but ruins their character.'
It was Nillia who had informed Professor Bungaegor that something was amiss with the river.
Nillia, the first to arrive at the scene.
The water spirit, contracted by Nillia, had sensed the discord and sent a signal. Realizing something was wrong with the river, Nillia had left a mark used by the &lt;Shadow Patrol&gt; for Yi-Han and Yonaire to see.
-Danger. Do not approach.-
She then hurried back to Professor Bungaegor. Given the urgency, she had run in a straight line instead of following the path.
-“Professor! The river spirit is being capricious!”-
-“The horses must be in danger! Lead the way!”-
...That's how they had swiftly arrived.
After hearing the situation, Yi-Han felt slightly sorry for suspecting Professor Bungaegor.
'I blamed an innocent person because of the skull principal.'
"No. But why did you foolishly enter without waiting in the meantime?" Professor Bungaegor was incredulous, seeing the students' wet clothes.
Ordinarily, upon seeing a river behaving wildly, one would think 'this is dangerous' and avoid it, not 'oh, it's a test' and jump in. But the students felt unfairly treated. The recent outrageous acts of the skull principal were still fresh in their minds.
"We really thought it was part of the test!"
"We thought it was a trap since the principal had prepared an underground dungeon under the beach last time!"
"Shouldn't you have properly checked the river first, Professor?"
"Yeah, yeah. My apologies."
Professor Bungaegor calmed the students with a wave of her hand holding a pipe. It wasn't the students' fault. The fault lay with the magic academy.
"But how did you manage to water the horses despite the river spirit acting up? Did you succeed in persuading it?"
"We tied ourselves with ropes and went in."
"..."
Professor Bungaegor was dumbfounded. Of course, persuasion wasn't the only solution when a spirit was angry. Like now, using ropes to physically overcome the challenge was a valid approach… It's just that ordinary students don't usually bring ropes to classes!
"You brought it, right?"
"Why would you think it was me?" Yi-Han protested confidently, his face so forthright that Professor Bungaegor inadvertently apologized.
"Ah. Was it not you, Wardanaz? My apologies."
"I did bring it."
"..."
Professor Bungaegor restrained herself from throwing her pipe.
Listening in, Nillia tilted her head and asked, "But why did you go in when I left a warning not to approach because it was dangerous?"
"..."
"..."
Yonaire's face turned slightly pale. Yi-Han's face also paled, but it wasn't as noticeable due to his complexion.
'Damn. From now on, I must check the signs while walking.'
Nillia had taught them, and Yi-Han had learned diligently, but they hadn't been checking every sign while walking. Yi-Han resolved to always check for signs wherever he went in the future.
"Could it be that you didn't see it?" one student queried.
"No, I saw it. But the others kept insisting on going," Yi-Han quickly deflected responsibility. Conveniently, Rowena was standing far away with the princess.
"Typical of those from the White Tiger, stubborn to the core. There was no way to change their minds."
"That's really how it was," another student confirmed.
Nillia was incensed by their words. It was always the nobility and knights causing problems. Even when she was in the mountains, tourists who came for fun did things they were told not to do, much to her annoyance.
Ignoring the safety rules set by the hunters working on the field!
"Such arrogance, right? Even the princess must be disappointed!"
"Knights are always like that. Don't be too hard on them, Nillia. We've already given them a stern talking to." Yi-Han had effectively prevented any further probing. Nillia nodded in agreement.
Meanwhile, the waiting white horse approached again, nibbling and pulling at Yi-Han's sleeve.
"Getting along, aren't you?"
"Not getting along. It's all a trick."
Pffft! Haahee! Pffft!
"See? It's getting angry. You shouldn't be fooled."
"...?"
Nillia looked at the white horse, not understanding. As someone who had become friendly with animals in the mountains, she could tell. The white horse seemed to genuinely like Yi-Han. Wasn't that behavior akin to 'Please notice me'?
Nillia cautiously spoke up, "It seems to me like you've gotten closer..."
"What are you talking about?" Professor Bungaegor, having calmed the lecture's water spirit, joined the conversation and was startled upon seeing the white horse.
‘It recognizes him as its master?’
Surprisingly, the griffin, or rather, the white horse, was acknowledging Yi-Han as its master. Considering what a griffin was – a creature with the wings of an eagle and the claws of a lion, prideful as the sum of those two – it was remarkable. Normally, it wouldn't submit to anyone unworthy or evil, even at the cost of its life. For such a creature to acknowledge Wardanaz as its master was unheard of.
Professor Bungaegor rubbed her eyes in disbelief and looked again. She asked, "What... what happened here?"
"Huh?" Yi-Han was on guard at the professor's question. He quickly denied it, "Professor, I didn't steal the rope."
Of course, the students from the Black Tortoise might have!
"...I'm not interrogating you; I'm just curious! Answer me! Do you think I'm Gonadaltes or something?" Professor Bungaegor was slightly irate. She's not some principal to be feared! "I'm asking because you seem to have gotten close to this white horse. Normally, it's difficult to befriend such a ferocious creature."
"Ah."
Yi-Han nodded in understanding and then said, "It's using tricks on me. A very cunning creature."
"..."
‘Are you the professor?’ Professor Bungaegor held back her thought and asked again, "What exactly happened?"
"Really, nothing special happened. I would have mentioned it if there had been."
With Yi-Han insisting to this extent, Professor Bungaegor had to step back. The boy from the Wardanaz family was known for his diligence and sincerity. He was not one to lie needlessly.
Yonaire, listening on the side, whispered, "You saved it from the water."
"Oh. That... The river spirit was acting up, and the horse fell over. I just helped it up and brought it out."
Yi-Han spoke as if it was nothing significant. Professor Bungaegor thought about it and then hesitated.
"Wait a minute. The horse fell over because of the river spirit, but how did you help it out? There wasn't enough time. Surely you haven't already learned &lt;Intermediate Control&gt; magic...?"
"Yes, so I carried it out. I cast a water shield to buy some time," Yi-Han explained.
"..."
Professor Bungaegor had to grip her pipe tightly between her index and middle finger. It was to prevent herself from throwing it at the exceptional student in front of her, who seemed unaware of the magnitude of his own actions.
'That's a big deal! What else would be, if not that?'
Now it all made sense to her. The act of risking one's own life in a potentially fatal situation to save another. It was this courage and honor that had led the griffin, or rather, the white horse, to recognize him as its master.
As her astonishment subsided, Professor Bungaegor felt an unexpected surge of pride. Many arrogant mages often mistook their vast knowledge and formidable magic as the key to taming animals. But in Professor Bungaegor's view, true talent lay somewhere deeper.
It was the heart that cared more for others than for oneself.
That heart was the real key. How could she not be delighted to see her student demonstrating such a simple yet vital principle?
Neigh.
"I said I won't let you go. Go away."
Heehee! Haahaa!
"Don't get angry. I won't let you go just because you're upset."
"..."
Eventually, Professor Bungaegor couldn't hold on any longer and dropped her pipe.



Chapter 112
Yi-Han was unaware of the incredible opportunity that lay before him — the affectionate loyalty of a griffin.
"Dammit!" Professor Bungaegor coughed out in frustration. Yi-Han, with a look of concern, handed her the smoking pipe, asking, "Did you swallow something wrong?"
"No, not that!" The professor was exasperated. Who was worrying about whom? Professor Bungaegor calmed herself and then suggested, "Why don't you try being a bit more kind to it?"
"How can I be any kinder here?" Yi-Han replied with a slight hint of confusion in his voice. His sincerity was so evident that even Bungaegor had no retort. Unknown to the students, Bungaegor had been keeping a watchful eye on the stables. It was only natural, considering she had entrusted her beloved horses to the care of the freshmen.
And Yi-Han had been sincerely taking care of the griffin. It was unusual for a boy of noble birth to show such dedication. The griffin's affection was not just because Yi-Han had saved its life; the care he had shown beforehand played a significant part too.
But that was a different matter. Right now, not trusting the griffin was a separate issue.
"Is there a problem with how I feed it or groom it?" Yi-Han inquired.
"No, it's not that... It's about trust and faith," Bungaegor explained.
The white horse nodded as if urging her to continue.
Yi-Han wasn't easily convinced. "Being kind and trusting blindly are two different things, Professor. Isn't the latter irresponsible?"
Silence fell. The boy from the Wardanaz family was making valid points today. Training an animal while overlooking its instincts and blindly trusting it wasn't a good practice. Trust and love were necessary, but so was a degree of skepticism.
But still...!
Heehee!
The white horse snorted in agreement.
"Look at that. It gets angry right away," Yi-Han observed.
"Fine. Handle it yourselves," Bungaegor gave up, turning away as the horse glared at her.
Yonaire, curious, asked, "What's that horse's name? It doesn't respond even when called."
The stable horses understood when they were called by name, but the white horse seemed to refuse to understand.
To be precise, it refused to understand.
-No matter what name you give it, it seems like it doesn't like it.-
-Isn’t it just that it has a bad temper?-
-No. Maybe it's because it's not a name it likes.-
-Isn’t it just that it has a bad temper?-
-It may have originally had a different name, so let's ask the professor later.-
-I think it just has a bad temper.-
Bungaegor was slightly taken aback by the conversation. Thankfully, she has turned away, saving her from revealing her expression to the students.
"Nif... Niffirg," She said.
"Niffirg... That's an unusual name."
"Niffirg," Yi-Han repeated, looking at the white horse. "Is that right, Niffirg?"
The horse shook its head as if in disapproval. Yi-Han, watching this, concluded, "It just has a bad temper."
Thanks to Professor Bungaegor's persuasion of the river spirit, the students who arrived later could easily give water to the animals. The students who had struggled earlier grumbled, "That's not how you're supposed to give them water."
"Do those guys even know how hard it is to water them when the water spirit is angry? That's the real challenge."
Yi-Han approached Professor Bungaegor, who was busy recording scores and fidgeting with her smoking pipe.
"Why? Wardanaz, your score is perfect. No need to worry."
"It's not because of that, but I have something to ask. While reading a book, I came across the name of a monster I haven't heard before."
"Speak," prompted the professor.
"Do you know of a monster named Sharakan?"
"The King of Leopards," Professor Bungaegor replied, tapping her smoking pipe to clean it. "According to the legends of the mountain dwellers, it was born between the rocky mountains and leopards. That's why it's worshipped by leopards."
"Is it a dangerous monster?" Yi-Han was not concerned with whether Sharakan was born between the mountains and leopards or between a spirit king and leopards. His concern was its danger level.
Professor Bungaegor answered with a tone of incredulity, "How could it not be dangerous? Even a regular leopard is perilous."
"...What if I were to make Sharakan into an undead and control it?"
"Why take such a risky step? Turning a monster into an undead doesn't erase its wildness and ferocity. If it finds a gap or grows dissatisfied, it might break free and attack."
"Oh..." Yi-Han contemplated whether to attack Professor Mortum with magic or a sword when they met next.
'Isn't this worse than the principal?' The principal hadn't given such a monster as a gift!
"Why ask that? Are you eager to create an undead monster already?" Professor Bungaegor asked with a sly smile. Rumors of his magic prowess among the professors indicated he was a talent of a different caliber.
"No, that's not it."
"Don't be shy about failing. Setting ambitious goals is something you can only do as a freshman."
'But that's not what I want.'
"Even if you want to create an undead monster, it's better to choose a suitable one in advance. Do you know the third most common cause of death among imperial dark mages last year? It's from summoning undead monsters they couldn't handle."
Yi-Han unconsciously rubbed his neck. 'I must treat it better in the future...'
As time came, Professor Bungaegor concluded her wait.
"Today's test taught many things. Those who were lazy learned how their laziness comes back to haunt them, while the diligent saw their hard work bear fruit."
Yi-Han looked at Niffirg, the white horse, who blinked innocently. 'This guy is up to something.'
The horse snorted in anger, sensing Yi-Han's suspicion. Clearly, diligence was far from its nature.
"If you feel lacking, don't just stop there; work on improving. Taming animals isn't the only challenging task. Magic can't be learned overnight either."
The students nodded thoughtfully, but Yi-Han mused, 'Aren't the lazy ones not here? The ones affected by the professor's words are the diligent ones, while the lazy students haven't even reached the river yet.'
Bungaegor, aware of this, instructed, "Pass this message to the lazy ones. Class dismissed! See you next time!"
"Thank you, Professor!"
As the students prepared to leave, calming their horses, Salko from the Tutanta family approached.
"Wardanaz."
"Tutanta."
"Did the horse enjoy the carrot?"
"Yes, it did. Thanks for that."
"I gave it because our horses like them. Glad to hear it was well received."
Rowena, passing by, looked at Yi-Han with an expression of shock and horror.
What did he just say?
"I came to ask for a favor," said Salko.
"Is it about the carrots?"
"No. The carrots were a thank you for what happened last time. This is a different matter. I need your skills."
Yi-Han was slightly surprised. Salko, with such strong pride, was asking him for a favor. What could it be? 'To rob the principal's storehouse?'
"Tell me."
"I need your cooking skills."
The Immortal Phoenix Tower was a tower where priests from various orders of the empire gathered. It was the quietest and most composed among the towers of the magic academu.
Dwarf Muhaddin was a priest of the Ciseners Order.
The Ciseners Order, devoted to knowledge and scholarship, researched and preserved the empire's various disciplines and was highly respected. The Tutanta family was also a patron of the Ciseners Order.
"The problem is that Priest Muhaddin hardly eats."
Yi-Han was still dumbfounded and took a moment to gather his thoughts.
'Why come to me with this?'
"That's unfortunate. Probably due to the poor conditions of the magic academy. Have you spoken to the principal?"
"No. It's not about the food. He naturally eats little. The problem is, in the Order, other priests took care of him, but here, no one can. Even the priests of the tower try, but there's a limit."
Yi-Han was about to say 'Then why ask me,' but Salko continued, "While worrying, I heard about your cooking skills. I asked other priests in the Immortal Phoenix, and they praised your cooking."
"It's because the priests are kind."
Yi-Han understood what had happened. His excessive flattery towards Priestess Siana had backfired. What kind of praises had she given...
"It must be from Priestess Siana. Being kind-hearted..."
"I asked Priestess Tijiling and others too. Wardanaz, you're too modest."
The students of the Black Tortoise behind Salko nodded as if they had no choice but to agree. The tomato vegetable stew that the boy from the Wardanaz family made at the last black market was remarkable. Even one of the Black Tortoise students glared at Yi-Han resentfully.
"Here, Renjid is from a family of renowned chefs in the empire. But he admitted he can't beat you."
Yi-Han thought for a moment that the other was insane. 'That's not a fair competition...'
After all, Yi-Han could use any ingredient he wanted, while the other was limited.
But still!
"So, you want me to cook?"
Yi-Han asked, regaining his composure. It was ridiculous, but not impossible. It wouldn't hurt to let Salko owe him a favor, and serving a priest from the Ciseners Order wasn't a bad thing. It's always good to befriend those who excel in their studies.
"Yes."
"Alright. Have you prepared the ingredients? Or should I help? I can get them for a good price."
Upon hearing Yi-Han's words, Salko shook his head.
"No. I've already found the necessary ingredients. We just need to go and get them together."
"Oh? Where are they?"
"In the kitchen."
"?"
Yi-Han paused. Was there a kitchen in the dormitory tower?
"Which kitchen?"
"The one in the basement of the main building."
"...I see. I just remembered I have urgent matters to attend to, so I'll be leaving now."
"Wait, Wardanaz! We need your help!"
"Without you, it can't be done! You're the one who infiltrated the White Tiger, aren't you...?"
The students from the Black Tortoise rushed over in a frenzy. To navigate the labyrinth-like backside of the magic academy, they desperately needed the boy from the Wardanaz family, skilled in magic.
"Why are you talking about strange things if you need my cooking skills? Bring out the ingredients, and then I'll cook."
"Wardanaz. Of course, we didn't plan to just ask you a favor! You'll change your mind once you see this."
Yi-Han was puzzled. What could possibly change his mind? 'What is it?'
"It's a forbidden book of dark magic."
A student from the Black Tortoise cautiously took out a steel box. Upon opening the lid, a blood-red covered book emitted a sinister curse.
"Close it!"
Bang!
The students quickly shut the box and then said with a smug expression, "How about it? This should make you reconsider, right, Wardanaz?"
"...No?"
"?!?!"



Chapter 113
The students of the Black Tortoise were genuinely perplexed, even Salko from the Tutanta family. They had been certain that Wardanaz would be pleased with the forbidden book of dark magic.
"Why not? Wardanaz?"
"Ah! Is it because you've already read it and it doesn't appeal to you? Oh no!"
The Black Tortoise students questioned among themselves, seeking answers.
Watching them, Yi-Han thought to himself, "Those from the White Tiger spreading rumors must all be locked up in the punishment room."
The rumors were tainting the sacred ground of magic learning, the magic academy
"Where did you find this book?" Yi-Han asked, curious. He knew the Black Tortoise students were actively searching for useful items, but he didn't expect them to find a dark magic book emanating curses.
"We found it in the Bottomless Hole area on the fourth floor of the library."
‘Just the name gives me chills,’ Yi-Han thought. The library at the magic academy was far from a peaceful repository of knowledge. The floors above the second were more akin to dungeons or labyrinths.
A Bottomless Hole area... one can imagine what sort of place it was.
"Why the library, of all places?"
"We're trying to complete the map of the academy. It would be convenient to have one."
"Oh..." Yi-Han was impressed. While the students of the Blue Dragon were eating, sleeping, and playing cards, those from the Black Tortoise were engaged in such constructive activities.
‘I wish I could swap our students with them.’
"I was looking for a book with the academy's map, but it's disappointing that it's not up to your level," one student lamented.
Yi-Han was about to clear the misunderstanding but then gave up, thinking it pointless as they wouldn't believe him anyway.
"Wardanaz, couldn't you at least read it once?" a Black Tortoise student asked with a voice dripping with regret, pained by the book's useless treatment.
Yi-Han might have read it under normal circumstances, but...
"Didn't the book emit a curse when you opened the box just now?"
A cursed book was a different story. It wasn't worth enduring a curse just to read an unknown book.
"Can't someone like you counter the curse and read it?"
Yi-Han looked at them suspiciously for a moment, wondering, ‘Are these guys plotting to assassinate me, instigated by the White Tiger?’
"I'm sorry, but I'm not at that level."
"Wasn't it so..." The Black Tortoise students were disappointed, having thought Wardanaz could handle it despite the curse.
"How do we lift the curse of magic absorption?"
"It seems impossible at our current level. Maybe if we ask a professor..."
"Do you think the professor would just let this be?"
"Wait a minute," Yi-Han interjected, having overheard the Black Tortoise students' conversation.
"What curse are you talking about?"
"The curse of magic absorption. The book absorbs mana."
The book with the blood-red cover absorbed mana from anyone nearby. Several Black Tortoise students had already collapsed from mana exhaustion, indicating the curse's complexity.
"Give it to me. I'll give it a read."
"See, Wardanaz, there's no need to be falsely modest. We already know your capabilities."
"We don't like it when someone with abilities is unnecessarily humble."
While listening to the nonsensical chatter of the Black Tortoise students, Yi-Han opened the box. Indeed, the blood-red book emitted a curse of magic absorption. Yi-Han felt his mana being slowly drawn into the book. And then, nothing happened.
'As expected.'
Wearing a bracelet and belt for absorbing mana, there was no change, so why would holding one more blood-red book make a difference?
Yi-Han was not surprised in the least.
&lt;Basics of Blood Magic and Its Applications&gt;
The importance of reagents in magic is undeniable. As the level of magic increases, so does the importance of the reagent, the price of magic. Among the various complex and diverse reagents, a mage's blood is considered the most powerful and ancient. Blood magic uses this blood as a reagent to amplify mana, enabling the use of powerful spells that are otherwise unattainable. Before beginning, it's important to mention safety precautions. The survival rate for novice mages practicing blood magic is less than 5%, but by following these safety rules, it can be increased to 7%. Before using blood magic, eat a hearty meat meal and get plenty of sleep the previous night, and drink as much water as possible before casting...
Yi-Han was surprised for two reasons. First, this wasn't a book of dark magic, but of blood magic. Both sounded sinister just by name, but there was a difference. Dark magic held a respectable place among the empire's famous schools of magic (though it wasn't popular), while blood magic was more a secret technique, a mere auxiliary to magic.
It was a technique that used blood to amplify the amount of mana. Of course, it was quite dangerous, but it was still a legitimate technique. Very dangerous, but… The second reason for Yi-Han's surprise was that the typography of this book was identical to &lt;Basic Lightning Element Magic and Its Applications&gt;.
'Now that I compare them, even the titles are similar.'
Both &lt;Basic Lightning Element Magic and Its Applications&gt; received from Professor Boladi and this book shared similar titles and identical typography.
'At first, I thought Professor Boladi wrote it, but he would never write in such detail. Who then? A disciple?'
"How is it? Wardanaz? Does it interest you?" The Black Tortoise students asked, their expressions anxious. It seemed they were quite concerned about whether the magic book appealed to Yi-Han.
"It's fine."
"!"
"Of course...!" One of the Black Tortoise students nodded happily. They had thought that Wardanaz wouldn't dislike such a dark magic book.
'They're making unnecessary assumptions again.'
Yi-Han's interest in the book was for a simple reason. It was certainly not because of a sense of challenge towards blood magic, a dangerous secret frowned upon by imperial mages.
Yi-Han had no interest in blood magic. Why would he amplify his mana with blood magic when he already had sufficient mana?
His interest lay elsewhere.
Here, the book introduced several spells that were usually difficult to use due to their high mana requirements, but could be executed under the assumption of using blood magic. Most of these spells required so much mana that they were rarely used in the empire, but their effects were undeniably powerful...
Magic, too, had its trends and popularity.
Magic that other mages didn't use would soon be forgotten and disappear.
And spells requiring a lot of mana were bound to be unpopular. After all, who would favor spells that consumed excessive amounts of mana?
But Yi-Han was different.
'I might actually be suited for spells that consume a lot of mana.'
Spells with high mana consumption often didn't require fine control.
He had little interest in blood magic; his curiosity lay in the spells that could only be cast using blood magic.
"Alright. I'll join you."
Yi-Han tucked the book into his cloak. The Black Tortoise students inwardly marveled at how casually he stored the cursed book.
'Truly a scion of the Wardanaz family!'
'Was the rumor true that they train from a young age by enduring curses?'
"But I have a few conditions."
"Speak. If it's within our ability, we'll agree."
"I, too, am exploring the academy, and I need the help of experienced thieves... I mean, friends."
"Did you just say thieves?"
"Wait. Wardanaz."
Salko interrupted his comrade's question.
"The Blue Dragon students are available, aren't they? Do you really need our help?"
Yi-Han was incredulous.
'Well, they can't compare in skill...'
The students of the Black Tortoise, hardened by various criminal activities, versus the Blue Dragon students, who had only lounged around commanding servants! The former was obviously more adept. However, he couldn't say that, considering his friends' pride.
"It might be dangerous."
Salko nodded, as if he expected such a response.
"Not calling your friends because of potential problems. I respect that."
Getting caught roaming the academy at night meant a trip to the punishment room. Wardanaz knew that, so he didn't call his friends from the Blue Dragon.
'But that's not it.'
"If you need help during your exploration, I'll assist."
"Secondly, I would like you to share the map’s information that you have gathered with me."
"..."
After a moment of consideration, Salko nodded. Sharing the map's information with another tower's student was regrettable, but Wardanaz deserved it. And the most important thing now was to serve priest Muhaddin.
"Lastly..." Yi-Han hesitated slightly, causing the Black Tortoise students to tense up. They wondered what the boy from the Wardanaz family might ask, hesitating like this.
"...I'll also take a share of the ingredients found in the kitchen."
"..."
"..."
Was that all he was waiting to say??
As evening fell, the thieves, or rather the students, gathered in front of the main building. Everyone present had roamed the academy at night at least once. Their attire and movements exuded ease and experience.
"Please to meet you, Mr. Wardanaz," Ratford, the most professional thief among them, greeted Yi-Han warmly. It was obvious that the Black Tortoise students would call Ratford for such an occasion.
Yi-Han, returning the greeting, paused.
"Didn't Nilia come?"
"You didn't call her, did you?"
Ratford looked at Yi-Han as if he was making no sense. Yi-Han thought he would have to clarify later.
"Let's go."
Yi-Han didn't want to inflate the Black Tortoise students' fantasies further, but only he and Ratford had been to the underground kitchen before. Naturally, Yi-Han ended up explaining. Even the roughest Black Tortoise student looked at Yi-Han with a slight expression of admiration.
In that brief span, how had they managed to explore the extents of the academy?
"Underground, starting from the food storage, there are various facilities, but a storeroom keeper guards the place."
"The storeroom keeper?"
"A blindfolded blind man, but with exceptional detection abilities. Once you encounter him, evading or hiding becomes nearly impossible."
Salko nodded, focusing intently on Yi-Han's words. Then a question struck him.
'But how did Wardanaz escape?’
If it was impossible, what method did he use?
"When you guys roam around the library or other places and get spotted, how do you shake them off?"
Yi-Han asked, seemingly curious. Yi-Han himself had various methods, starting with a belt of invisibility, but the Black Tortoise students probably didn't have such options.
Did they have a special way?
"One of us would draw their attention and get caught. The rest of us used that moment to escape their sight."
"..."
Yi-Han marveled at the crude method.
It was unsophisticated, but he had to admit, it was effective.
'I should try this if I'm ever with the White Tiger students.'



Chapter 114
The party skillfully opened a door behind the main entrance on the first floor of the main building and entered. The space, usually not open to students, began to reveal itself beside the corridor. Mesmerized unwittingly by the sight of the empty banquet hall and large hall, the students of the Black Tortoise stared in awe. They wondered why, despite such places, they had to eat hard bread in the lounge.
Yi-Han and Ratford exchanged glances.
-"Don't let your guard down,"- one warned.
-"Of course,"- the other agreed.
Ratford recalled the thief's creed: "When revisiting a place once burgled, be several times more cautious."
Yi-Han thought of the skull principal.
‘Since the underground passage was breached last time, he must have changed and strengthened the defense system.’
They could not expect the luck of entering the underground without a trace, as before.
Click.
As expected, they saw a suit of plate armor walking towards them from far down the corridor.
-"How can you confuse me with a freshman?"-
-“...”-
When it was discovered that Lee Han and Ratford had succeeded in escaping through the passage of the underground warehouse, the warehouse keeper was called in by the principal and reprimanded.
Yet, the warehouse keeper remained unshaken.
-"But, even so, it's impossible to distinguish by the amount of mana,"- he protested.
-"Foolish... Fine, I understand. There's no immediate fix for this,"- the skull principal conceded.
He couldn't reprimand the warehouse keeper too harshly for missing Wardanaz this time; the warehouse keeper was too competent. More than just managing the underground warehouse's inventory, he was responsible for facility maintenance and various other tasks. Occasionally, he even caught unlucky students roaming at night. One mistake was not enough for further reprimand.
Honestly, even the skull principal considered this mistake unavoidable. Who could have predicted a boy from the Wardanaz family, an anomaly, would appear before the warehouse keeper who distinguished intruders by mana?
-"I'll lend you my summon. Don't rely solely on mana; find other ways to detect intruders."-
-"Yes, I'll do my best."-
-"If you find the boy from the Wardanaz family, don't let him escape. Send him straight to the punishment room."-
-"Why must I do that?"-
-"Just do as I say, will you?"-
After the conversation with the principal, the warehouse keeper significantly increased the security at the back of the main building and the underground.
To the students, it was like a game of cat and mouse. Once they found a way in, they kept coming back. So, a harsh lesson was necessary.
-"Don't even dream of coming this way!"-
The summon lent by the skull principal would surely catch the fearless intruders.
The warehouse keeper started his routine inspections, following the designated path.
"It's a walking suit of armor!" The students of the Black Tortoise whispered in terror.
"Do you know it?"
"I've encountered it before."
The students shivered. How many had been captured because of that walking armor?
Since it wasn't a person inside, attacking it fiercely only resulted in it reassembling itself, and if they managed to immobilize it, it soon called for reinforcements.
Yi-Han pondered, ‘Is there a way to capture it?’
The summon reminded him of Giorvan the Second, the guardian of the previous desert arena.
The summon was of a non-living, inanimate type. However, being non-living did not equate to invincibility. If it sustained significant damage, the summon would be forcibly unsummoned. The problem was...
‘Lightning element magic seems effective, but using it now would be problematic…’
Winning or losing the fight wasn't the issue. Engaging in battle meant certain loss for the students. Especially using loud, flashy magic like lightning element would be akin to announcing their presence.
‘It's better to avoid it.’
"It seems we haven't been discovered yet. We should avoid it. Has it followed us well?"
"I'm not sure. It depends..."
Yi-Han decided to retreat with his party.
Click.
But, another suit of plate armor had already appeared far behind them. The faces of the Black Tortoise students turned ashen.
"I'll lure it..."
"To the side!"
Yi-Han didn't hesitate and opened a door. It was one he had noted for escape when they had first entered the corridor. An old space, probably once used as a classroom, appeared. Chairs and desks were stacked with various clutter.
The Black Tortoise students instinctively scanned the clutter for anything useful - a professional habit.
"If the armor enters here..."
"I know, Wardanaz. Scatter and run, even if someone gets caught?"
When faced with an insurmountable crisis, the principle was to minimize damage by scattering and fleeing.
The Black Tortoise students already knew this rule.
"No. I'll cast magic to knock it down. Don't be surprised and just run. It'll be very loud."
"..."
Hearing Yi-Han's confident plan to take down the armor, the Black Tortoise students thought, ‘We brought the right person!’
Not many would dare to speak of bringing down the armor. The Black Tortoise students felt fortunate to have him.
Thunk!
“?”
A clattering sound came from the clutter behind. The tense students turned in surprise.
"Did you touch it?"
"No... you?"
Paper and a quill appeared, then words were etched onto it.
-Can't you keep quiet, freshmen?-
"A... a ghost!"
-Not a ghost, but a senior. You foolish freshmen.-
The writing on the paper stopped the students' shivering, but they were far from reassured.
"Why are you... doing this, senior?"
"Yeah, show your face."
-Don't talk nonsense. I don't want to go to the punishment room. This is risky enough!-
"...?"
Yi-Han was momentarily puzzled.
‘Ah. Contact with a freshman leads to the punishment room by the principal.’
Such a thing was very much within the realm of the skull principal's actions. Otherwise, there would have been cases of students contacting seniors.
-Anyway, keep your voices down and converse in whispers. If you don't want to be caught by that armor. And don't spout nonsense about a freshman using magic to knock it down!-
Yi-Han slightly regretted his words after hearing the unknown senior's admonition.
Was it too reckless?
"I thought lightning element magic would suffice... Sorry."
-...You know how to use lightning element magic?-
The other party seemed slightly taken aback. The handwriting trembled.
-Still, don't do it. It's too noisy. I'll get caught too.-
Yi-Han and the Black Tortoise students realized how precious this encounter with the senior was. When would they have another chance to converse with someone who had been in the academy longer?
"Senior, how can we evade that armor?"
"Senior, what's the best route to the kitchen from here?"
"Senior, what's likely to be on the &lt;Basic Imperial Geometry and Arithmetic&gt; exam?"
The sudden barrage of questions seemed to fluster the senior.
-Am I here just to answer your questions? Can't you stay quiet for a moment? You don't even know what kind of armor that is…-
Yi-Han intervened, stopping his friends. Annoying the senior and missing out on valuable information would be a loss.
"Everyone, calm down and let's listen to the senior. What kind of creature is that armor?"
The walking armor was a summoned creature often used by the skull principal. Being non-living, it could roam the academy all the time, equipped with the ability to detect heat, making it a notorious summon for catching unlucky students!
But the harsher the academy, the more the students evolved to adapt. They had a few tricks up their sleeves: using fire magic to create a diversion, illusions that emitted heat to deceive it, or covering themselves thickly to prevent heat escape.
-The classroom here is under an illusion I cast. You can open the door and look out, but the armors won't notice. However, if you make noise, it's all for nothing. So please, everyone, keep quiet!-
'Ah, so that was the strange feeling.'
Yi-Han understood on his own.
When they had entered the classroom earlier, something had felt subtly off. It seemed unchanged at a glance, but it was an illusion crafted to emit just enough heat to be detected.
'This can be used in such a way too.'
Yi-Han mentally noted this, thinking it a valuable lesson. It would be helpful in his future wanderings around the academy.
"I didn't notice at all."
"Me neither."
-Would it be an illusion if you could notice it?-
The quill moved swiftly, leaving words that seemed to carry a hint of pride.
"So, senior, what were you doing here?"
-...-
"???"
-...I was heading to the kitchen.-
"That's great! We were going there too."
"But why were you heading to the kitchen, senior?"
The senior fell silent again. Yi-Han asked.
"Are you hungry?"
"Come on, Wardanaz. That can't be it."
"Right. A senior wouldn't be..."
-...Yes, that's it. I need a reagent hidden in the kitchen.-
The senior hastily made an excuse. The others exclaimed in admiration, but Yi-Han looked skeptical.
'It doesn't seem right.'
-The armors have passed. Let's move now.-
"Could I possibly learn the illusion magic you used to deceive the armors?" Yi-Han inquired. Surely, he would learn such magic in illusion class eventually, but Yi-Han needed it now. He couldn't exactly ask the walking armors to wait until he learned it.
The senior scoffed and started writing.
-I can tell you about it, but it's not a spell a freshman can learn right now.-
"Still, could you tell me the method..."
As Yi-Han persistently requested, the senior relented, albeit reluctantly, and explained.
&lt;Farhait’s Lesser Illusion&gt;.
This was the magic used to deceive the walking armors. The chant "Heat, distort the air" summoned an illusion filled with heat.
Instead of altering the interior of the classroom, the senior had spread a curtain-like layer of appropriate heat. This was sufficient to evade the gaze of the walking armors, and summoning an illusion alongside required a considerable expenditure of mana.
There was no reason to waste mana unnecessarily.
'A freshman couldn't do it.'
The senior had readily shared this information, thinking it utterly impossible for a freshman. Lacking in both the skill to manipulate magic and the sufficient mana to wield it, how could a freshman cast this spell? It was quicker to teach them and let them quickly give up than to refuse outright.
"Freshmen, quickly, to the kitchen..."
"Heat, distort the air!"
As the incantation was uttered, an illusion enveloped Yi-Han and his party. To the senior watching from outside, it appeared as if Yi-Han and his group had vanished.
It was Yi-Han's first time casting this spell, and he wasn't sure if it had worked properly. So, he asked, "Did this work correctly?"
-...The aesthetic of the illusion seems a bit lacking... perhaps the colors are too faint…-
The senior, almost unwittingly nitpicking, blushed upon realizing what he was doing.
What a disgraceful act!



Chapter 115
The series of illusion magic by Farhait was more challenging than other types of illusion magic. It wasn't merely about creating illusions; the addition of heat as an element naturally increased its difficulty.
&lt;Farhait’s Lesser Illusion&gt; ended with just adjusting temperatures suitable for the illusion, but the intermediate and advanced levels could even summon illusions that actually attacked intruders.
‘Stay calm,’ the senior thought, realizing the disgraceful nature of his actions, and calmed his mind. Being a freshman didn't necessarily mean failure in magic. Perhaps, he was fortunate enough to find a spell that suited him.
-So, you seem to have a talent for fire element magic. I'm guessing right, aren't I? You showed your talent in Professor Garcia's class, didn't you?-
"Professor Garcia has forbidden the use of fire element magic."
The senior was at a loss for words. Talent aside, what on earth had happened for fire element magic to be banned?
‘What's with this guy?’
The group moved to the kitchen. With the possibility of encountering walking armors or warehouse keepers at any moment, they couldn't afford to waste time. An unidentified senior, waving a piece of paper and a quill pen, led the group forward.
The door, marked with a teapot symbol, creaked open.
-Here's the underground 'Teapot' kitchen. It's relatively accessible compared to other kitchens in the academy. It's a bit disappointing that there's no alcohol…-
‘Is alcohol that important?’
Unlike Yi-Han's thoughts, the students from the Black Tortoise were greatly disappointed.
"No alcohol..."
"Really too bad."
"Can a kitchen even be without alcohol?"
Yi-Han was dumbfounded by his friends' strong desire for alcohol.
‘What are they thinking…’
Did they come here to learn or to drink?
While the Black Tortoise students were searching the kitchen in vain hope for alcohol, the senior called Yi-Han. After the disgraceful display in &lt;Farhait’s Lesser Illusion&gt;, it was time to show something more befitting of a senior. To the unsuspecting and famished freshmen, the academy's hidden places would be profoundly impressive.
-Come with me. And try not to scream.-
“?”
-Open that cupboard.-
Yi-Han, puzzled, opened the cupboard at the senior's behest.
‘Is it a trap?’
There were hams and sausages, made from cut pieces of meat, hanging inside.
Yi-Han was grateful for the sight of the salted or smoked sausages.
"Oh, thank you. It was pretty well made."
-...-
The senior was flustered.
Normally, freshmen would be overjoyed at the sight of such a find. The senior himself had been thrilled when he accidentally found a piece of sausage in a professor's workshop during his first year. He had eaten it greedily without even using a fork or knife. The taste of that sausage was still memorable.
But this freshman boy was casually critiquing the quality of the food. This was not the behavior of a typical freshman. What in the world...?
"Wardanaz. I've found the ingredients we need. Can you come and help me?"
"Sure. I'll be right there."
The Black Tortoise students gathered ingredients and lit a fire under the cauldron.
-What are you doing?- The senior asked, looking perplexed.
"We're making a nutritious meal for a friend."
-Not a bad idea,- The senior nodded approvingly.
The magic academy was too harsh a place to survive on what was given. This was especially true for freshmen. To survive, one had to fend for oneself.
-...Just a moment. Just a moment.-
The senior, alarmed, tried to intervene. The cooking was unlike anything ordinary; even the atmosphere differed. The ingredients in the pot were undergoing a chemical reaction, emitting a unique mana. It was a form of alchemy.
And judging by the preparations, the process was evidently complex.
‘It seems a magic spell might be needed…’
-This is not something a freshman should handle. Stop them!-
‘Is it?’
Yi-Han questioned Salko, needing confirmation after having heard so much. "Tutanta. I heard that this cooking is not ordinary, but a kind of alchemy, and quite challenging. Is that true?"
"Yes." Salko nodded readily.
Yi-Han felt slightly relieved at his response.
"It seems he has some confidence in this."
Salko wasn't reckless; he wouldn't have started this if he wasn't sure.
"Seeing how prepared you are, you must be confident."
"Yes."
Then Salko handed a scroll to Yi-Han, who hesitated.
"...?"
"Here, I've recorded our family's secret recipe in as much detail as possible. You can do it."
Yi-Han was astonished. It was surprising that Salko trusted him with the family's secret recipe, but more than that… Did the Black Tortoise students really have that much faith in Yi-Han?
‘These kids are overestimating me too much.’
Rumors about his dark magic were one thing, but alchemy was a completely different area.
"I'm not that proficient in alchemy..."
"Priestess Siana praised you highly. If a priestess from the Flameng Order commends you, it must be true."
"Wardanaz. There's no need to be modest in front of us."
The Black Tortoise students seemed to say, 'What are you talking about?'
Yi-Han seriously considered whether he should be less flattering to others in the future.
‘Um. But I think don’t I can make it.’
Yi-Han then read the Tutanta family's secret recipe. The ingredients were numerous and complex, but not impossibly difficult. He had conducted far more challenging experiments; there was no reason to be scared of this.
-This is not a task for a freshman.-
The senior scribbled with his quill. Yi-Han replied, "I think I can do it."
-...You'll regret it later.-
The senior hoped this arrogant freshman would fail in alchemy and spill the contents of the pot over himself.
Isn't that how first-years learn their limits!
The liquid in the pot turned golden, the bubbles reduced, and it began to settle gently. The Black Tortoise students gasped in awe.
"As expected..." Salko nodded as if he knew it would happen.
"Thank you, Wardanaz. I was sure you could do it."
Yi-Han felt ambiguous about the trust the Black Tortoise students had in him, but he didn't show it outwardly. At least it turned out well! However, the senior watching was so dumbfounded and speechless at the absurdity of the situation.
-You're not a freshman, are you?? Tell me. What year are you??-
"I am a freshman, senior."
-What kind of freshman are you!-
Ordinary freshmen did not master &lt;Farhait’s Lesser Illusion&gt; in one try. They did not maintain their composure upon seeing the food in the kitchen either. Moreover, Wardanaz executed the complex alchemical process without a single mistake.
"Wardanaz is indeed a freshman, senior."
"Yes, why are you questioning Wardanaz like this?"
The Black Tortoise students began to doubt the senior they couldn't even see.
Was he deliberately trying to obstruct Wardanaz, who was clearly capable of the task?
The senior, aware of their skepticism, was speechless with a sense of injustice.
To be accused so absurdly!
"So, Tutanta. Is it finished?"
"Yes. This is our family's secret, Beer Candy."
"???"
Yi-Han doubted his ears for a moment.
Despite its playful name, Tutanta's family secret, the Beer Candy, was a serious nutritional and preservative food item. It could be stored at room temperature for months, and just two finger-sized pieces provided enough nutrients for two days.
"Try one, Wardanaz."
Yi-Han cautiously tasted the condensed Beer Candy, reminiscent of a sweet and soft flavor akin to traditional Korean malt candy.
Salko, full of pride, asked, "Can you feel your mana recovering?"
"...Uh, yes."
Yi-Han managed his expression, recalling the last time he had a magic potion.
"But why is it called Beer Candy?"
"Our ancestors, suffering from a beer shortage while trapped under a mine, created it as a substitute for beer and named it accordingly."
"I see..."
Yi-Han, bemused by the seemingly trivial origin, casually nodded, cut a piece of Beer Candy, wrapped it in paper, and placed it in his pocket. Having accomplished the desired cooking, it was time to collect useful items from the kitchen and return.
'Where were those sausages earlier?'
-A big problem!!!-
The senior hastily scribbled with his quill, the urgency so great that the last word was incomplete.
"What's the matter?"
-The warehouse keeper is coming! Hide in the corner!-
"Heat, distort the air!" The senior chanted along with his spell. This was a much more elaborate magic than before.
A convincing illusion was necessary to cover the mess made by the cooking in the kitchen.
"Can we really deceive the warehouse keeper with this?"
-I don't know! Just stay quiet!-
The senior's tension spread to the other students. Yi-Han and the Black Tortoise students watched the kitchen door with rigid faces.
"...?"
However, the warehouse keeper walking in the corridor didn't open the door. Yi-Han sensed the warehouse keeper casting a spell outside.
"He's casting a spell!"
-Casting a spell... Wait. How did you know?-
The senior paused, taken aback while writing with his quill. He had set up a far-seeing summon in the corridor to detect anyone approaching, but the freshman had no such thing.
How did he know?
"The movement of mana indicates the use of a spell, doesn't it?"
-You’re able to sense that from here? No. That's not important right now. The warehouse keeper seems to be up to something.-
The senior looked down the hallway in dismay. The warehouse keeper, who should have just patrolled and rested if nothing was amiss, was now casting spells on each door for some reason.
That spell is...
'Space magic!'
The senior's face turned ashen. Breaking space magic was notoriously more difficult than other types of magic. Among all magics, it was infamously difficult. To cast such magic on the doors...
'What's he doing! Has he gone mad?'
It was supposed to be a normal patrol, and if nothing unusual was found, just return to rest. Today, for some unfathomable reason, the warehouse keeper had cast space magic on every door.
After the warehouse keeper disappeared, the senior tried to leave the kitchen by opening the door but soon returned inside. To Yi-Han and the Black Tortoise students, it seemed as if the door had merely opened and closed.
"What are you doing?"
-...Try it yourself, and you'll see.-
The freshmen went out and came back in immediately, looking at the door with the same baffled expression as the senior.
-The space of the door has been twisted. It's the warehouse keeper's magic.-
"Do you have a way to solve this, senior?"
-No. We're doomed.-
Yi-Han nodded resignedly to the senior's written words.
"So, we end up in the punishment room after all."
"Sorry, Wardanaz. It's our fault."
"It's alright. I was prepared for this from the start. Just keep your promise later. I didn't take anything, but just in case, I hid them well."
The senior was astounded by Yi-Han's unchanging expression even at the brink of entering the punishment room.
What kind of...?
-Actually... there might be a way.-
"Oh? Is that so?"
The senior became seriously curious about what situation would finally fluster this freshman boy.



Chapter 116
-But for that method to work, your full cooperation is needed.-
“...”
“...”
Yi-Han managed to keep his expression under control, but the students of the Black Tortoise looked suspicious.
After all, it was an academy where even the professors couldn't be trusted. Thus, it wasn't certain that a senior could be trusted either.
'He talks like that, but he wouldn't betray us, would he?'
'Doesn't that senior seem like he's from the Blue Dragon or the White Tiger?'
-...Freshmen. Your doubts about me now... Damn it! This cursed academy. Yes! I understand why you would suspect me. I would feel the same. But after coming this far together, are we really going to distrust each other!? And if you don't trust me, how do you plan to get out of here?-
"You have a point."
Yi-Han soothed the students of the Black Tortoise.
Although the senior whose face they didn't recognize seemed suspicious, they had no other choice in their current predicament, trapped in the pantry by the warehouse keeper's magic.
The options were to either stay trapped and get caught, or listen to the senior's plan.
"Let's at least hear him out."
-First, I need some of those beer candies you made.-
“...”
Salko's eyes shifted suspiciously, as if he was looking at a con artist, but still, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a beer candy.
He did this more out of trust in Yi-Han's words than in the senior himself.
-I'm not trying to steal anything from you freshmen.-
'The more he talks, the more suspicious it gets...'
-As you know, I've used too much magic today getting here. I have almost no mana left. I need to recover.-
'Ah, that makes sense.' Yi-Han found himself convinced by the senior's words.
Unlike Yi-Han, who had never felt a shortage of mana, other mages often found their mana depleted after using magic.
The unknown senior had been using magic several times from the classroom to the kitchen. It wouldn't be surprising if his mana was nearing depletion.
Crunch, crunch - The beer candy gradually disappeared into thin air.
Yi-Han suddenly grew curious and asked, "But if you're low on mana, how are you maintaining the invisibility spell?"
-It's not my spell.-
'...The skull principal?!' Despite the calm font, Yi-Han could somehow sense the senior's fear. Could it be… 'Did the skeletal principal cast a spell to prevent the seniors from contacting us?'
He wanted to shout out loud, asking why it had to be this way, but Yi-Han didn't. He was beginning to accept the reality of this magic academy.
'Hmm. That's just how he is. No use being surprised; it would only be a disadvantage for me.'
-It's done. Just watch.-
The senior, seemingly having regained some mana, moved forward.
The spell the warehouse keeper used on the pantry door was a spatial distortion spell. It sounded simple, but breaking through it was anything but. At least three different spells were needed.
First was &lt;Sensory Enhancement&gt;.
The 2nd circle spell &lt;Sensory Enhancement&gt; was popular among warriors as an enchantment spell. Once cast, even a slow, dull warrior could display the swift reflexes of a swallow skimming the water. Not only that, but the enhancement of senses like sight and hearing meant more information could be gleaned on a chaotic battlefield. Spatial magic fundamentally distorted the five senses, so at least this level of enhancement was necessary to counteract it.
Then came &lt;Spatial Perception&gt;.
&lt;Spatial Perception&gt; was a 1st circle spell, but in terms of difficulty, it was harder than the 2nd-circle &lt;Sensory Enhancement&gt;. This was due to the complexity of spatial magic. &lt;Spatial Perception&gt; allowed the mage to accurately visualize the nearby space in their mind. It was a level far beyond simply looking with the eyes and making rough estimations. Knowing exactly what objects were around oneself and the precise distances between those objects. Normally, it was a magic used as an aid by battle mages who often faced swift enemies, but it was essential when dealing with spatial magic. If one couldn't even perceive it, a solution was impossible to find.
Lastly, a spell with moderate destructive power was needed. Any spell would do as long as it had destructive power. It was necessary to find a weak spot in the distorted space and break through it to escape.
'The mana has been restored.' The senior took a deep breath. As a third-year student bearing the symbol of pure silver, he had to show a proper example in front of the freshmen… More than anything, it irked him that a few of them still doubted him.
"Senses, be enhanced. Space, be perceived. Flames, form into arrows and fly!"
The chant was quickly recited, and the spell was cast. The senses were enhanced, and the surrounding space was converted into information that entered his mind. Then, a flaming arrow flashed and pierced a point in the air.
"!"
"Wow...!"
Even the doubting students of the Black Tortoise were amazed by the flaming arrow.
Indeed, a senior is a senior!
The flame, burning as if to engulf the surroundings, maintained the sharp form of an arrow as it shot out.
The freshmen could appreciate how difficult that magic was. Maintaining the form of the flame as an arrow and shooting it simultaneously.
'The form maintenance is imperfect, and there's a slight loss of control during the launch.'
...Except for Yi-Han.
Yi-Han, deep in thought, suddenly startled.
'No. Am I thinking like Professor Boladi?'
So what if the form maintenance was a bit imperfect and control was momentarily lost. It wasn't a significant issue in casting the magic. Only perfectionists like Professor Boladi would nitpick over such details...
Yi-Han reflected on the fact that he was thinking like Professor Boladi.
'There's no need to obsess over perfection. Otherwise, I might end up like Professor Boladi.'
Pop!
The flaming arrow collided and then disappeared in flames.
The students of the Black Tortoise waited in awe.
'When can we leave?'
'Is it now?'
-Sav…-
“??”
-...e me…-
“...”
“...”
On the crookedly etched paper, the students realized that the senior had failed.
Even if the senior begged to be saved, the invisible freshmen couldn't do anything.
After a while, the senior seemed to regain consciousness, and more writing appeared.
-...I'm sorry. You saw an unsightly scene.-
"What happened?"
-Failed.-
"Beer..."
“?”
As one of the Black Tortoise students started to speak, Yi-Han looked puzzled.
What was he trying to say?
"Beer candy thief...!"
“...”
-It's not that! Do you think I deliberately failed after taking the beer candy!!-
The senior desperately explained, not wanting to be remembered as a senior who ate the beer candy and ran.
There were two reasons for the failure. One was that the range and strength of the spatial distortion magic were more extensive and stronger than expected, depleting too much mana for &lt;Spatial Perception&gt;.
The other reason was the spatial distortion magic being more intricately woven than anticipated. It seemed the warehouse keeper had infused more mana than usual, making it harder to break through.
As a result, even though the flaming arrow was shot, it couldn't penetrate and was deflected.
"So... you ate our beer candy but failed to escape..." Salko spoke in a serious tone. The senior, if not for the principal's magic, would have wanted to grab the freshman by the collar and have it out with him.
-These... these clueless fools... they don't even realize how difficult that magic is…-
"Senior. Could you just teach me &lt;Spatial Perception&gt;?"
Yi-Han, who had been listening, spoke up.
Having heard the detailed explanation, it didn't seem all that impossible to him. For the enhancement of senses, he would use &lt;Gonadaltes' Agile Steps&gt;. For the magic needed for penetration, &lt;Gonadaltes' Sharp Hand&gt;.
If he could just learn &lt;Spatial Perception&gt;, Yi-Han felt he might be able to give it a try.
It was a 1st circle spell, so with some luck, he might be able to learn it right away.
-You, freshman... really…-
The senior was about to scold him, thinking 'Does a first-year student really believe they can learn spatial magic on the spot?' but he hesitated. Firstly, he was in no position to talk after his own failure, and… He somewhat wanted to hear the freshman say, 'This seems impossible for me'.
-Fine. I'll write it down for you in as much detail as I can.-
As the senior wrote, a sudden worry crossed his mind… What if this freshman manages to succeed in this magic on his first try?
An hour later.
Yi-Han and his group emerged from the underground kitchen and gathered in the moonlit courtyard in front of the main building.
Yi-Han, facing the floating piece of paper, spoke with sincerity, "Senior, thank you. You seem to teach even better than the professors."
"Wow..."
"High-year students really are different."
The other Black Tortoise students seemed to agree with Yi-Han's sentiment.
Seeing Wardanaz react like that, it was clear that the senior's teaching ability was extraordinary. Perhaps the senior was more of a theorist, better at teaching magic than using it.
'...'
It was a good thing the freshmen couldn't see his face. The senior covered his face with his hands and sat down on a nearby rock, sighing heavily.
'I've wasted my magic studies...'
He had prided himself on being quite exceptional among his peers… But today, that pride was completely shattered. And by a freshman he had just met!
If he told his friends in the Tower what he had seen today, none would believe him.
The conversation would probably be as follows...
-"I went to the kitchen today because I was hungry and wanted to steal something, but then a freshman learned &lt;Farhait’s Lesser Illusion&gt; right away when I taught him. It was so amazing that I taught him &lt;Spatial Perception&gt; too. And he managed to perceive and break through the warehouse keeper's spatial distortion magic on his first try."-
-"You went to the kitchen to drink and came back drunk?"-
-"Did the principal catch you and hit you with a spell?"-
-"Besides, can &lt;Spatial Perception&gt; alone break through spatial distortion magic? Don't you need other things?"-
-"Ah. That's... well, the freshman... maybe... I might have seen it wrong, but it seemed like he was using a spell the principal had used before...?"-
-"Yeah, you must have seen it wrong. How could a freshman use the principal's magic?"-
-"In my opinion, that freshman might be the principal in disguise. Hey, be careful. You might get dragged to the punishment room by the principal within this week. You didn't say anything weird, right?"-
-"That's why I told you not to interact with freshmen!"-
…
"Senior? Are you still there?"
"Maybe he's already gone?"
"We've said everything we needed to, so he probably just left. He's pretty cool."
-I'm still here…-
The senior gathered his strength and stood up.
It was truly shocking, but students who entered this magic academy were used to accepting shocking realities. The fact that a freshman was more skilled in magic than himself or his friends was hard to accept… But then again, neither the magic academy nor the skull principal were particularly easy facts to accept.
Just accept it!
-Thank you for today.-
"No, thank you for teaching so well."
'Is he mocking me?'
Yi-Han's sincere gratitude sounded like mockery to the senior at this moment.
-Freshman. In this academy, those who meet at night usually don't ask each other's names or families. It's because you might get dragged to the punishment room together.-
"..."
Yi-Han was speechless at such a starkly realistic reason.
-But I really do want to know your name. Even if we end up in the punishment room, I swear on my honor to keep it a secret.-
The senior wrote earnestly.
He was truly too curious. What kind of person... no, what kind of freshman was this?
Yi-Han thought to himself, 'This senior must be either hard of hearing or lacks interest in others.'
Earlier, his Black Tortoise friends had kept saying 'Wardanaz, Wardanaz', and he didn't even notice.
The students from the Black Tortoise wore expressions of disbelief.
But there was a reason for the senior's obliviousness. Unlike the freshmen, he had been continuously watching the corridor outside, preoccupied with his surroundings. Moreover, his mind was half gone because of that monstrous freshman!
After pondering, Yi-Han made a decision. Judging by his words, he didn't seem like someone who would snitch to the skull principal.
'It should be okay to tell him.'
-First, I'll tell you my name. I am Balfatan of the Moradi family.-
"..."
"...My name is Gainando."
"...!!!"



Chapter 117
The students of the Black Tortoise, watched as Balfatan of the Moradi family, oblivious to the astonishment on their faces, nodded in approval.
-Gainando... A great name befitting of a remarkable talent.-
Confusion marked their faces.
-Remember my name. We’ll meet again someday.-
The senior, clutching a quill and paper, departed.
One student from the Black Tortoise, finally regaining his composure, asked Yi-Han in a perplexed tone, "Wardanaz, is this really okay?"
"Didn't he say we shouldn't share names or family affiliations with those we meet at night?"
The students were speechless at Yi-Han's quick application of the lesson he'd just learned from the senior.
‘Is this what it takes to be one of the top-ranking students in our year?’
"And you all, think about it. Which family did that senior belong to?"
"The Moradi family."
"Do you think a member of the Moradi family would trouble us later, or not?"
The students of the Black Tortoise pondered Yi-Han's question. The students of the White Tiger were typically rough, noisy, and stubborn. Leading them was Jijel of the Moradi family. Despite their polite and kind facade, the students affiliated with the Salko gang were not fooled.
A more venomous snake always leads the snakes.
"They'll likely cause trouble."
"That's right. That's what we just prevented. No need to thank me. Just remember this later."
Having gathered his things, Yi-Han slung his backpack and waved goodbye.
Watching him leave, one Black Tortoise student said to Salko, "Tutanta, I think I understand why you said not to talk to Wardanaz when alone."
Salko nodded in agreement.
While they respected Wardanaz for his skills, responsibility, and loyalty to his friends, they couldn't ignore the fact that if he wished, he could easily overpower any of them. Even to the rough-edged students of the Black Tortoise, Wardanaz was a formidable figure.
"Wardanaz... What a fearsome person!"
Thanks to an early end to their exploration, Yi-Han returned to the Blue Dragon's lounge to attend to his duties. He sorted the groceries from the pantry into the cupboard in his private room...
‘It's so full, nothing else fits. I should ask Yonaire for help.’
...organized items by expiration date, recorded them in the ledger, and sold... no, served snacks to his resting friends.
Finally, Yi-Han could sip his coffee and focus on his studies.
Despite the easy-to-forget fact that students were enrolled in the academy for academic purposes, Yi-Han had resolved not to be outdone in his studies.
‘I had vowed not to be bested academically, even if I was ignorant of other matters.’
He had intended to show the pampered nobles of the empire the frenzied dedication of someone hungry for success, but life's demands had led him to specialize in other areas.
‘Is it just my imagination?’
Yi-Han piled his study books neatly. It reached even where Gainando was drooling asleep on the sofa by the fireplace. Noticing this, Yi-Han felt something amiss… ‘Do I have more to study than others?’
He recounted, doubting his perception.
&lt;Basic Magic Understanding&gt; by Professor Garcia.
Not only basic elemental magic but also other branches were to be covered in the test, as he had been warned.
If that was the case, then dark magic, summoning magic, and illusion magic had been added.
Even if Professor Garcia conducted the test in a straightforward manner, the professors of dark magic, summoning magic, and illusion magic were a different story. They gathered students who would attend their classes the following year and taught them, setting certain expectations even if they did not formally conduct tests.
Considering this, Yi-Han realized he needed to read at least two books from each of these fields.
"Click, click, click."
‘This isn't unusual,’ Yi-Han thought as he pushed a book to the side and checked the next one.
&lt;Understanding Basic Alchemy&gt;.
Alchemy was a field where relying solely on intuition without studying could lead to serious injury. Despite Yi-Han's well-honed alchemy senses from harsh experiments, he couldn't neglect theoretical study.
Especially when considering students like Yonaire, Adenart, and Priestess Siana, who had studied alchemy before joining the academy, Yi-Han felt the need to study even harder.
With that in mind, he should read about three books on the subject...
"Click, click, click."
Yi-Han stacked another book to the side.
&lt;Basic Riding Training&gt;.
The test was over, but Professor Bungaegor's teachings continued every week. Learning about the dangerous and unpredictable creatures in the academy was crucial not just for escaping, but for survival.
‘Just one book,’ he noted with relief, despite its thickness.
Then came &lt;Basic Imperial Geometry and Arithmetic&gt; and &lt;Basic Imperial Language and Logic&gt;. Essential subjects with a clear need for study.
The stack of books grew taller.
It seemed like he was almost done, but there was still more.
Yi-Han pulled out additional books.
&lt;Basic Lightning Element Magic and Its Applications&gt; given by Professor Boladi. Not studying this in advance could mean learning it the hard way in front of Professor Boladi, possibly through direct experience with lightning.
The dark magic book (forcibly) given by the skull principal.
He had to practice &lt;Gonadaltes' Sharp Hand&gt;, taught previously, until he mastered it. Otherwise, he risked being dragged into dreams again.
And the most recent one, &lt;Basics of Blood Magic and Its Applications&gt;.
No one said he had to read it, but to survive in the academy, he knew it was necessary. The usefulness of even one competent spell was something he constantly felt.
After stacking all the books, Yi-Han looked up. Gainando's face was obscured by the pile of books.
"...Hmm."
‘This is strange.’
He had only arranged the necessary books, so why were there so many?
Gainando, who had dozed off in the lounge and then slept soundly in his bed until morning, was surprised to see Yi-Han awake in the lounge.
"You wake up really early, don't you?"
"I haven't slept yet."
Gainando quietly skewered a marshmallow and toasted it over the fire until it was soft.
He then sandwiched it between two pieces of hard bread and nibbled on it.
"Why go through all that...?"
“Gainando. You're far too laid-back."
Asan of the Dargard family walked down with a tired expression. It was the week of tests, so he had stayed up all night studying in his room. The effort he put into mastering &lt;Basic Imperial Geometry and Arithmetic&gt; was tremendous. He probably thought Wardanaz had also stayed up all night for the same subject.
"Wardanaz, I understand. Even after all this effort, I feel like I've only understood about 80% of &lt;Basic Imperial Geometry and Arithmetic&gt;."
"That's still good. I still have a lot more to study."
Listening from the side, Gainando tilted his head in confusion while eating a marshmallow. There seemed to be some misunderstanding in the conversation between the two.
As evident from Asan holding only the &lt;Basic Imperial Geometry and Arithmetic&gt; book, he had indeed studied only that subject. In contrast, Yi-Han...
‘Didn't he have a mountain of books yesterday?’
Indeed, before going up, the books had been piled up like a mountain, but now only one book remained.
Driven by curiosity, Gainando asked, "Where did all the other books go?"
"I put the ones I've studied in my personal room. They were getting in the way."
Gainando dropped his marshmallow in shock.
"Are you insane?!"
"What's wrong, Gainando?"
"Yi-Han stayed up all night studying!"
"That's what everyone does, you fool."
Students from the Blue Dragon, who came out one after another, scolded Gainando.
Making such a fuss over studying just one subject?
Everyone was studying!
"But... hey... I mean..."
Gainando trembled with indignation. These guys hadn't even seen the pile of books in the lounge!
"It was a huge pile, really...!"
"Stop talking nonsense and just finish your bread."
Gainando swallowed the rest of his bread, savoring its deliciousness.
"But Asan, why did you study in your personal room yesterday instead of the lounge? Isn't the lounge better?"
"You keep talking in your sleep loudly."
"...Sorry..."
Meanwhile, Yi-Han finished reading &lt;Basic Lightning Element Magic and Its Applications&gt; for a second time and stood up. He wasn't entirely pleased, but it was time to start his day.
"Wardanaz, what lecture are you attending today?"
&lt;Basic Swordsmanship&gt;.
"Oh... dear."
His friends looked at him with pity. It was already a tough week with tests, and now he had to attend the &lt;Basic Swordsmanship&gt; class. The mere thought seemed exhausting.
"Are you okay?"
"I'm fine."
Yi-Han was puzzled by his friends' concern.
Contrary to the subjects he had just finished studying, the &lt;Basic Swordsmanship&gt; class, where he could just physically participate, was actually more relaxing.
However, his friends looked at Wardanaz's departing figure with worried expressions.
"The White Tiger guys are not going to use the test as an excuse to jump him, are they?"
"Next time we see those White Tiger guys, let's warn them not to mess with Wardanaz."
The friends from the Blue Dragon firmly resolved to stand together in friendship. It was a determination that would have enraged the students of the White Tiger had they heard it.
"What's going on? The atmosphere is strange."
The mood was unusually excited and chaotic, unlike the usual &lt;Basic Swordsmanship&gt; class. Puzzled, Yi-Han asked Dolgyu.
Dolgyu spoke in a low voice, "Today, for the test, people from outside are coming, Yi-Han."
Yi-Han now understood why the students of the White Tiger were chattering with a mix of excitement and anxiety.
People from outside were coming. They were likely peers from knightly families, just like the students of the White Tiger.
For the students, all from knightly families, it was inevitable to feel nervous. If they showed poor swordsmanship or made mistakes in front of them...
"Everyone will be tense. Actually, I'm nervous too."
"In that respect, I'm at ease,” Yi-Han spoke confidently.
Being from a family of mages, he had no reason to be embarrassed in swordsmanship class or to hear comments like 'Why is someone from that family so clumsy with a sword?'
Belonging to a family of mages indeed!
Dolgyu was visibly taken aback by Yi-Han's words.
"Yi-Han, with your skills, you shouldn't feel embarrassed even when facing guests from outside."
"Really? I hope that's not too presumptuous. Do you think it wouldn't be embarrassing if I ended up using magic in a fight?"
"..."
"It's a joke."
"Right, of course."
Dolgyu regained his composure, having turned pale at the thought that Yi-Han might have been serious.
"Attention."
With a tap-tap sound, Professor Ingurdel appeared.
"Welcome, everyone... No need for a long speech. This week is simply a time to assess how well the students have been keeping up, through a simple test. That's why I've invited guests from outside."
As Professor Ingurdel spoke, knights in full armor appeared from behind.
"They're our age?" Yi-Han asked Dolgyu.
Looking at the knights' faces, they seemed to have spent at least a decade more on the battlefield than the students present.
"They might be... somewhat older peers..."
"Here, the knights who have come are all distinguished members currently active in their respective orders."
The students were astounded.
Yi-Han thought to himself, 'Professor Ingurdel seems to be subtly similar to Professor Boladi in his ways.'



Chapter 118
While Yi-Han entertained the most disrespectful thoughts in the world, Professor Ingurdel was basking in self-contentment.
‘I have indeed brought the right ones.’
The knights brought by Professor Ingurdel, the White Wood Knight Order, were among the empire's most prestigious. This was not an order that stayed put, guarding a specific region. Instead, they roamed the empire, seeking dangers to confront. That was the essence of the White Wood Knight Order.
Common wisdom held that knights usually traveled grandly with servants and slaves, but the White Wood Knight Order was an exception. Its knights wandered the vast and harsh lands of the empire alone, clad in nothing but a single suit of armor and accompanied only by a horse.
For this, mere skill in swordsmanship was insufficient. They required a wide array of abilities, including adaptability and quick thinking in various situations.
Such knights could surely teach much to the young students!
‘Far better a choice than bringing knights of their own age…’
While Professor Ingurdel was feeling proud, Bikelintz, a knight of the White Wood Order, stroked his beard and frowned.
‘I came at Ingurdel's request, but it seems I've come to the wrong place.’
Bikelintz didn’t favor dealing with students or young squires. He had no idea how to interact with them. His swordsmanship, honed for real battles, was not meant for teaching or imparting lessons. Though he had come at Ingurdel's request, owing him a favor, the feeling of being out of place did not fade.
These were not knights staking their lives on the path of the sword but those also pursuing the path of magic.
"Knights enrolled in a magic academy, of all things."
Bikelintz neither disliked nor disregarded mages. Every knight, at some point, owed something to a mage. But he was uncomfortable with the idea of these young students, who would be insufficient opponents in swordsmanship alone, also learning magic.
There was no rule that they had to learn from Bikelintz or the knights of the White Wood Order. They could have called for kinder knights from other orders or perhaps peers who were squires...
"So, what should we do, Professor Ingurdel?"
"Just treat them comfortably as I mentioned before coming. Just spare their lives."
"Understood."
Bikelintz sighed and walked away with the knights. They dispersed to their respective positions, each taking a wooden sword and standing in place, seemingly waiting for the students.
Yi-Han opened his mouth, trying somehow to persuade Professor Ingurdel. If the White Tiger guys didn't step up, then Yi-Han had to.
"Professor. Fighting these knights one-on-one is a bit..."
"Don't worry, Wardanaz."
Professor Ingurdel smiled. Yi-Han almost felt relieved at that smile but then snapped back to reality.
'No, this is not the time to be relieved.'
"Of course, you will fight in groups of three against one. Gather according to the teams selected last time."
"..."
Indeed, it was not the time to be relieved. Yi-Han cursed Professor Ingurdel inwardly and moved forward.
Jijel approached with an extremely displeased expression, much like Yi-Han's.
Dolgyu cleared his throat and spoke, "It's a stroke of luck that the three of us have come together like this again..."
"Stop with the insincere remarks, Choi."
"Luck? Perhaps the same kind of luck as meeting the skull principal."
Dolgyu, scolded simultaneously by Jijel and Yi-Han, looked downcast. Yi-Han felt sorry and apologized, "I'm sorry, Dolgyu. It's not your fault."
"It's okay, Yi-Han."
Yi-Han looked at Jijel.
'Hmm.'
He realized that in just a few days, he had managed to built up grudges against the Moradi family twice. Once against the skull principal's summon, and once against a senior member of the Moradi family.
This realization brought a tinge of guilt to Yi-Han. Thus, he decided to make a slight concession this time.
"I will yield in this test. Moradi, I will follow your lead."
The situation was surprising, with Yi-Han conceding first, but Jijel showed no joy. Instead, she was overtly suspicious.
'What's he plotting?'
There were those who could be subdued and made to swear allegiance, and those who could never be subdued. Wardanaz was the latter.
Jijel knew this and had given up on expecting Wardanaz to kneel before her. But Yi-Han's sudden compliance was suspicious.
"...What are you planning?"
"What plan? Moradi, we can't score in this test without mutual concessions. That's why I'm yielding."
Yi-Han was always sincere when discussing tests. This sincerity slightly swayed Jijel.
Really?
"But Wardanaz, even if you say you'll follow my command, you'll disobey at the first chance... you brat."
"That's only when your commands are crap... I mean, unreasonable."
Dolgyu listened to their conversation, wondering when he should intervene.
Maybe it's better if they don't talk at all...
"...Fine then. I'll take your word for it. But I'll be watching."
"Please do. So, Professor Ingurdel, who are we up against?" Yi-Han asked while looking around.
Where's the drawing?
Professor Ingurdel kindly responded, "It's Sir Bikelintz."
"...Wasn't this supposed to be random?"
To Yi-Han, the knight called Bikelintz seemed like a leader, likely the most skilled.
"The best deserve a worthy opponent."
"Ah... I see..."
Yi-Han struggled to manage his expression. Professor Ingurdel, unaware of Yi-Han's inner thoughts, offered encouragement, "With the three of you, you can surely put up a good fight."
"Yes, Professor... Ingurdel."
Bikelintz, facing the three young students, spoke in a serious tone, "You may use every means at your disposal to attack."
Dolgyu asked with surprised eyes, "Is that... allowed?"
"Not using what you can is more unnatural. Use magic if you can. I won't hold back either."
'I wish you would, though,' Yi-Han thought as he picked up his wooden sword. From just a few words, he had a sense of what kind of person the opponent was.
Bikelintz was a strict knight, like Arlong, Yi-Han's teacher. The problem was that, unlike Arlong, who had gone easy on Yi-Han, Bikelintz would not.
A person who tells students to 'use every means to attack' usually meant they would defend using every means too.
Jijel sensed this ominousness, a subtle anxiety crossing his face.
"Choi family?"
"Yes, that's correct."
Bikelintz guessed Dolgyu's family from his stance alone.
"Double swords... the Moradi family."
Jijel nodded in agreement.
"And..."
Bikelintz was startled when he saw Yi-Han.
His stance was unmistakably that of the Azure Rock Style...
Was there a family known for using the Azure Rock Style?
Apart from the empire's knight Arlong, he knew of none, which left him quite bewildered.
"Which family do you belong to?"
"The Wardanaz family."
"Wardanaz... Hmm... Huh?"
As Bikelintz's face, as hard as a chunk of iron, contorted in confusion, Dolgyu and Jijel found themselves empathizing without realizing it.
'I understand that feeling.'
"Well... After all, in learning swordsmanship, the family isn't that important."
Embarrassed by his own confusion in front of the students, Bikelintz changed the subject and ended the conversation. But his bewilderment did not subside.
...Why is a student from the Wardanaz family here?
Moreover, judging by his stance, his swordsmanship training was not just a day or two's worth.
"Yi-Han, there's no opening in his stance..." Dolgyu swallowed hard and muttered under his breath.
The pressure emanating from Bikelintz was that intimidating. He was merely standing there, pressing his wooden sword down, yet the pressure he exerted was immense. It was impossible to guess how strong he really was.
"Since he said to use whatever methods we can, let's do just that."
Yi-Han drew out his staff.
In truth, Yi-Han didn't believe he could win against Bikelintz, a veteran knight who had wielded his sword for decades on the battlefield. Any strategy would likely be ineffective against such an opponent.
But standing still wouldn't yield any points.
To hear 'You lost, but fought well' from Professor Ingurdel, they had to give their all.
"Feet, grasp the earth."
Yi-Han cast the &lt;Gonadaltes' Agile Steps&gt;, not only on himself but on the other two as well.
&lt;Gonadaltes' Agile Steps&gt;, similar to the &lt;Sensory Enhancement&gt; spell, was more efficient and practical...
'There are side effects, but that's not my problem.'
The muscle soreness his friends would experience after the spell was none of Yi-Han's concern. Winning was the priority.
"Thanks, Yi-Han."
Dolgyu nodded, feeling the magic enveloping his body. Even without asking, he could tell Yi-Han was enhancing them with magic.
"Space, be perceived."
"?"
However, Yi-Han's incantation did not stop there.
After casting spells on the three of them, he immediately continued with another without pause, leaving Dolgyu bewildered.
"Hands, sever the enemy. Heat, distort the air..."
Sharp mana swirled around Yi-Han's hands, and at the same time, mirage-like illusions began to appear.
If unsure what magic would be effective, the answer was simple… Use them all.
At this point, not only Dolgyu and Jijel but also Bikelintz began to feel alarmed.
They had expected him to use at most one or two spells, but he was using far more.
'Should I intervene?'
Bikelintz looked towards Professor Ingurdel.
Using magic to this extent could lead to mana depletion, which could be fatal for a young mage.
Shouldn't the professor intervene?
Yet, Professor Ingurdel sat undisturbed, simply watching. Bikelintz grew even more perplexed.
'This isn't like him.'
"Flash!"
Yi-Han did not miss the moment Bikelintz's attention wavered.
He instantly cast a 1st circle lightning spell, targeting Bikelintz. A flash of lightning shot towards Bikelintz.
Bikelintz, without even looking, casually dodged it.
"Attack!"
Jijel shouted to Dolgyu and charged forward. Even without a signal, it was clear that this moment, enhanced by magic, was an opportunity.
'What kind of magic is this...'
Her legs moved much lighter than usual. Even Jijel, who disliked Wardanaz, had to acknowledge the effectiveness of the magic.
However, Bikelintz seemed unimpressed by the slight increase in the students' speed. With an expressionless face, he rolled his foot and moved at a speed far surpassing theirs.
"Ugh!"
A pained cry escaped Dolgyu's lips.
Although Dolgyu prided himself on being the fastest swordsman among the White Tiger students, Bikelintz was on a different level.
The moment Dolgyu lunged at the knight, Bikelintz's figure vanished, and an irresistible counterattack followed. All Dolgyu could do was fly backward and roll on the ground.
Swoosh!
Bikelintz, about to completely overpower Dolgyu, halted his attack. A bead of water was flying towards him.
The knight of the White Wood Order casually tilted his head to dodge it. He expected, like the water spells he had seen so far, that dodging it would be the end.
However, the water bead swirled around beside his face and targeted Bikelintz again.
Surprised, Bikelintz swatted it away with the back of his hand. The water bead, containing significant mana, left a heavy sensation on his mana-reinforced hand.
"Excellent."
Bikelintz praised sincerely.
Many superior mages among the upperclassmen could not exhibit such ingenuity. To modify a simple low-level spell so effectively was impressive.
Yet, Yi-Han, the recipient of the praise, felt slightly conflicted.
'Everyone except the professor is praising me.'
His feelings were a mix of happiness and a touch of sadness...
However, this was not the time for such thoughts.
Yi-Han gripped his staff and prepared for the next spell.



Chapter 119
"Spring forth," the incantation echoed, repeated several times. With each repetition, beads of water began to take shape, slowly revealing themselves. This was more than a simple spell. The &lt;Spatial Perception&gt; spell was known for its ability to allow the mage to precisely understand the space around him. But its capabilities extended further, enhancing the effectiveness of long-range attacks.
Controlling a large number of water beads was originally a challenging task, but this spell changed the game. It significantly increased the number of beads that could be manipulated simultaneously. Such an ability to combine and link spells was a testament to a mage's ability, but it was only possible with the aid of mana.
In the midst of this display of power, Dolgyu and Jijel, who had forgotten even their initial intent to rush at Bikelintz, stood frozen. Their eyes widened, filled with a mix of astonishment and disbelief. The sheer number of water beads was overwhelming. It was just too many.
"Amazing!" exclaimed Bikelintz, his focus completely shifted from the battle. He had forgotten to counterattack and simply stood there, mesmerized. Normally, giving a powerful mage like him time to prepare was a cardinal sin in combat. Just a moment's incantation was enough to turn the tide of battle. But this time, instead of retaliating, Bikelintz found himself caught in awe, unable to disrupt the spectacle unfolding before him.
Intrigued, he turned to Professor Ingurdel and asked, "Can all first-year students at this magic academy use magic like this?" Bikelintz was already planning his next steps. If it were true that a mere first-year student could wield such power, he would have to reprimand the mages of the White Wood Knight Order. After all, if a first-year could do this, what did that say about the capabilities of the knights' mages?
"No."
"Definitely not."
"Absolutely not."
It wasn't just Professor Ingurdel who responded with such seriousness, but also Dolgyu and Jijel. At that very moment, as if to punctuate the gravity of their words, Yi-Han's attack recommenced. Water beads formed in mid-air, each tracing its own unique trajectory and speed. Yi-Han's technique, though he might have been reluctant to admit it, bore a striking resemblance to Professor Boladi's renowned &lt;Magic Arrow Control&gt;. The aggressive hurling of numerous projectiles was remarkably similar to the standards set by Professor Boladi.
Watching this, Professor Ingurdel frowned with concern. He was well aware that Yi-Han was learning about magic combat under Professor Boladi, having heard as much from several other professors. He remembered the words: "Do you understand, Ingurdel? Compared to Professor Bagrak, I am nothing. So don't go spreading tales about me, especially not to His Majesty the Emperor." And also, "Why... would Yi-Han learn from Professor Boladi... I didn't realize his talent could be a curse... My apologies. This isn't something I should discuss with you, Professor Ingurdel…"
The professors of this magic academy, being mages themselves, tended to have extreme personalities. Yi-Han, too, was beginning to emulate these professors. A freshman, he had managed to levitate an excessive number of water beads. Even with abundant mana, the mental strain of controlling each one must have been significant.
With these thoughts, Professor Ingurdel seriously considered visiting Professor Boladi to make a request. Wasn't it potentially dangerous to let Yi-Han levitate so many water beads so soon? "I must speak cautiously," he thought to himself. Among the professors of this magic academy, only Professor Ingurdel seemed truly capable of protecting the students.
Yi-Han felt a shiver run down his spine, accompanied by a single thought: 'So strong!' This strength, the kind that could instill fear in others, was it typical of a high-caliber knight? Yet, unbeknownst to Yi-Han, there was another reason for his chill, one that he was completely oblivious to. Had he known, he would have implored Professor Ingurdel, "Please don't say anything strange to Professor Boladi!"
But at that moment, Yi-Han's entire focus was on confronting Bikelintz. Dolgyu and Jijel coordinated their attacks, rushing in from both sides. Despite the barrage of water beads from mid-air, Bikelintz remained unshaken. He effortlessly cut through the incoming water beads, scattering them, and repelled the two swordsmen with ease. Yi-Han realized, 'This... even &lt;Ferkuntra's Lesser Thunderbolt&gt; won't work.'
The only reason the three students were able to maintain their ground was that Bikelintz wasn’t aggressively pursuing them. Yi-Han knew that if Bikelintz switched to an offensive attack, their combined efforts would quickly fall apart. They needed to inflict some damage while Bikelintz was still holding back, but this was proving to be a daunting task.
Yi-Han had never planned to win the battle with the water beads. They were a distraction, a feint to confuse Bikelintz and create an opening. But the lack of any opening was proving frustrating. 'Why on earth did Professor Ingurdel bring such a knight here...' he wondered, yet despite his complaints, his body instinctively moved towards the best possible strategy in that moment.
"I hide in the night," whispered Yi-Han, uttering the incantation softly as he stepped back into the illusion. His body began to fade, becoming transparent. Unnoticed by Bikelintz, who was distracted by the distance and the multiple illusions created by &lt;Farhait’s Lesser Illusion&gt;, Yi-Han found a moment of respite.
'This far only.' Even with the invisibility spell, Yi-Han dared not approach closer. He was wary of the opponent's acute senses. From Professor Boladi's teachings, he knew that a skilled mage could detect their surroundings using mana alone, even when blindfolded. A skilled knight would likely have the same ability. Approaching within a certain range would surely give him away, despite the spell of invisibility. It was a frustrating limitation, but it was one that he had to accept.
Taking a deep breath to steady himself, Yi-Han braced for what was to come. Time was now his adversary. 'I believe in you, Ferkuntra!' he silently affirmed. "Strike down, Ferkuntra's Thunderbolt!" he called out. Mana erupted from the center of Yi-Han's body, transforming into lightning energy. The spell he was casting, a spherical form of lightning energy, was a feat impossible with the 1st Circle spell &lt;Lightning Creation&gt;. The energy surged fiercely before shooting out towards its target.
Bikelintz, for the first time that day, was genuinely surprised. The boy from the Wardanaz family had managed to stealthily approach and launch a lightning spell from behind. And it wasn't just any spell, but one that appeared to be at least of the 4th Circle! The speed of the casting, especially in the heat of battle, was astounding. Casting spells in a calm environment was one thing, but doing so under pressure, quickly and accurately, was quite another. This level of skill was beyond even the mages of the White Wood Knight Order. 'Wardanaz family... were the rumors underestimated?' Bikelintz wondered.
Clang-!!!! A purple light erupted from Bikelintz's sword, clashing head-on with the incoming lightning. The thunderous roar that followed tore the lightning apart, scattering it to the sides before it vanished upon striking the ground. The scorched earth where the lightning hit testified to its power, but for Yi-Han, it was a hollow victory. '...Ferkuntra. I will never trust you again!' he thought bitterly. What use was acknowledging the spirit’s power if his trusted magic was so easily blocked?
Cursing Ferkuntra in his disappointment, Yi-Han realized that Bikelintz's attitude had shifted. "I am truly impressed," Bikelintz acknowledged, his sword still crackling with residual lightning. He decided that remaining passive would be an insult and rudeness to an opponent who, despite being young and a freshman, displayed remarkable skill. A sincere response was due.
Yi-Han felt a familiar chill run down his spine. Even without words, he knew what was coming, a prelude to countless similar experiences. "It seems there's a misunderstanding, Sir Knight..." he began, but before he could finish, Bikelintz burst forward, swift as lightning.
Instinctively, Yi-Han began to chant, "Gather, condense, and explode!"
One of the most common misconceptions among non-mages was the notion, 'Couldn't one simply read a grimoire and practice to cast magic without learning from a master?' However, this idea was far from reality. Grimoires used by mages were not primarily for knowledge transfer, but more a reflection of the personal satisfaction of the individual mage. They showed little concern for making the content understandable to the reader. Filled with codes, abstract metaphors, squiggly writing, and abbreviations and references known only to the author, grimoires posed a significant challenge to decipher.
This challenge was evident as Yi-Han struggled with the first chapter of &lt;Basics of Blood Magic and Its Applications&gt;. Despite this book being comparatively detailed and well-written among those he had encountered, deciphering even one spell was a struggle. The spell he managed to understand was &lt;Piblicus's Great and Tremendous Magic Missile&gt;, a creation of the distinguished blood mage Piblicus for future generations of blood mages.
The name of the spell was both ironic and grandiose. Magic Missile, typically a simple 1st Circle spell, was so basic that some mercenaries claimed to be mages by mastering it. However, &lt;Piblicus's Great and Tremendous Magic Missile&gt; was far from standard. It required drawing a massive amount of mana instantaneously and condensing it—a simple principle, but incredibly effective for a blood mage who could amplify mana through blood magic or someone like Yi-Han with abundant mana.
Yi-Han, finding the spell useful, had diligently studied it but never anticipated using it in real combat without prior practice. As he condensed the mana, a strange, unsettling squeaking noise emerged. Initially, Yi-Han thought the magic had failed, but it hadn't. The condensed mana moved according to his will, seemingly on the brink of explosion.
Yi-Han realized the significance of the word 'explode' in the incantation. Normally, a standard Magic Missile would include commands like 'shoot' or 'launch.' But 'explode' implied something different. This spell wasn't meant to fire a Magic Missile at all; it was designed to compress a vast amount of mana into an unstable form and detonate it at close range. Such an unstable Magic Missile couldn't maintain its form to fly; the spell had entirely abandoned the process of launching.
Cursing the blood mages for their dangerous creation, Yi-Han focused his mind. Abandoning the spell now would be akin to suicide. In these circumstances, his only option was to control the impending explosion. 'Control it,' he thought, bracing himself for what was to come.
As Bikelintz charged forward, he was taken aback by the sudden explosion of mana that erupted before him. The rapidity with which such a spell was cast left him in shock. "Ugh!" he grunted, channeling mana through his muscles, fortifying them against the force of the blast. The destructive power of the spell, especially given the brief time it had been cast, was astounding.
While admiring the young adversary's skill internally, Bikelintz managed to knock Yi-Han's staff out of his hand, seemingly bringing the fight to an end. With the conflict appearing to be over, he sheathed his sword and approached Yi-Han. "Perhaps in the White Wood Knight Order..." he began.
But in an unexpected turn of events, Yi-Han swiftly drew his wooden sword and lunged forward. The wooden sword halted just inches from Bikelintz's chest. Bikelintz, initially surprised, then allowed a smirk to cross his face. "I still have much to learn. To make such a mistake..." he reflected, realizing that he had been so absorbed in the spell that he had mistakenly thought the fight was over when the staff was disarmed.
In a gracious acknowledgment of his oversight, Bikelintz conceded, "I have lost." He recognized that, considering the impressive performance of this young freshman, Yi-Han truly deserved the victory.



Chapter 120
"Thank you," said Yi-Han with genuine sincerity. He felt truly grateful to Bikelintz, who, despite being in a position to deny defeat, had acknowledged it, taking into consideration the feelings of a young freshman.
Bikelintz then posed a question, "Are you interested in joining the White Wood Knight Order?" Yi-Han hesitated. He understood that being part of the White Wood Knight Order was akin to a demanding job, with honor as the only compensation. The hardships these knights faced, wandering the empire alone for honor and conviction, were beyond imagination.
"I am still lacking, especially as a knight," Yi-Han politely declined. However, to Bikelintz, this seemed to carry a different meaning. "You're not lacking. Of course, you need to learn more, but a few years here could make you a superior mage than any in the White Wood Knight Order. And we don't expect our mages to have knightly skills, so don't worry about that," Bikelintz assured him earnestly.
Yi-Han was taken aback by this serious offer. Bikelintz continued, "Moreover, your skills as a knight aren't lacking either. As a mage, you're more than sufficient. Other knights would be ashamed."
"Please, calm down, Sir Bikelintz," Professor Ingurdel interjected. "He's just a freshman. It's too early to decide his future."
Yi-Han felt relieved by Professor Ingurdel's intervention. He realized that it was Professor Ingurdel who had brought Bikelintz here in the first place. "You're right. I got too excited and greedy," Bikelintz acknowledged.
"It's my pleasure to hear you praise my students," Professor Ingurdel responded, as they engaged in a warm conversation. Meanwhile, other knights from the White Wood Knight Order, having finished their duel, approached.
"Is it over, Sir Bikelintz? How did it go?"
"Weren't you too harsh on the students, Sir Bikelintz?"
"I lost," Bikelintz admitted, surprising the knights. As he explained what had happened, pointing at Yi-Han, the knights looked at him with admiration and awe, making Yi-Han feel uneasy.
Yi-Han discreetly moved behind Jijel, who walked away with an annoyed expression. "Everyone did well," Professor Ingurdel praised, acknowledging not just Yi-Han but all the students who had struggled, constantly restraining Bikelintz's movements with spells during the battle.
"It's a perfect score. This wasn't meant to be a battle for victory, but to win like this is unexpected," the professor added.
Yi-Han suddenly remembered that the objective of this test wasn't necessarily to win. Bikelintz's aggressive approach had made him forget that. "However, seeing my students exceed expectations is the greatest joy for a teacher. Thank you for giving me such pleasure," Professor Ingurdel said.
"No, thank you!" exclaimed Dolgyu, moved by the professor's words, though Yi-Han and Jijel remained somewhat indifferent.
Yi-Han couldn't help but think about the White Wood Knight Order. 'Don't they know moderation?' he wondered. Ever since Professor Ingurdel introduced the White Wood Knight Order, it had always seemed like too much.
"The knights of the White Wood Knight Order were also very satisfied with the duel. They said they would definitely tell their colleagues about today's events," Professor Ingurdel mentioned.
"What do you mean professor?" Yi-Han asked.
"As they have asked to be called upon if such an opportunity arises again, it seems they were truly satisfied, not just being polite," Professor Ingurdel explained.
"Yes, it seems so," Yi-Han agreed, but with a sense of unease. 'Could it be that I'll have to fight the leader of the White Wood Knight Order in the midterm?' he thought apprehensively.
After the lecture, Yi-Han and Dolgyu were walking together when Yi-Han suddenly stopped, causing Dolgyu to look at him puzzled. "What's wrong? Is everything okay?" he asked with concern.
In response, Yi-Han suddenly knelt down, feeling the aftereffects of &lt;Piblicus's Great and Tremendous Magic Missile&gt;, a spell he had used earlier. 'Ugh,' Yi-Han grimaced, wishing he could confront Piblicus for classifying this potent magic as a 1st Circle spell. 'How can this be 1st Circle?' he thought in frustration.
The principle of the spell was simple: gather mana in front of oneself, induce instability, and then detonate it, rather than launching it. However, its destructive power and the inherent danger were far beyond what Yi-Han had expected. It was essentially like throwing a bomb in front of oneself and detonating it. The only safety mechanism was the mage’s ability to push the exploding mana away with all their might. Failure to control it meant being caught in the blast too. 'Such a reckless spell. Blood mages... they should be banned in the empire,' Yi-Han thought.
Although he believed he had managed the spell well enough to avoid the shock, his vision was now shaky and dizzy. He mentally resolved to rename &lt;Piblicus's Great and Tremendous Magic Missile&gt; to &lt;Piblicus's Insane Magic Explosion&gt;.
"Yi-Han! You can't die!" Dolgyu exclaimed, misunderstanding the severity of Yi-Han's condition.
"It's not that bad, stop making a fuss," Yi-Han reassured him, trying to downplay his discomfort.
However, Yi-Han had another concern. "Dolgyu," he said weakly.
"What's wrong?! Tell me if you need anything!"
"Keep your voice down... We can't let the guys from the White Tiger notice my condition," Yi-Han whispered, aware of the importance of not showing weakness.
Dolgyu, struck by the gravity of the situation, which reminded him of a knight returning from battle, was momentarily lost for words. 'You're just a first-year student, Yi-Han...!' he thought, but he understood the need for discretion and quickly agreed.
"Hold on, Yi-Han. I'll take you to the healing room," Dolgyu said, supporting his friend. As they walked, a friend from the White Tiger group noticed them and asked, "What happened?"
"...Just training!" Dolgyu replied hastily.
"Really?" came the skeptical response.
With urgency, Dolgyu hurriedly took Yi-Han to the healing room, away from further inquiries.
As Yi-Han regained consciousness in the healing room, he overheard a conversation. "It’s a symptom of mild mana concussion. What crazy professor let off a magic explosion near a first-year?" said a voice, expressing concern.
"That... I can't say. I'm sorry," Dolgyu replied, clearly hesitant to reveal more.
"Fearing retribution from the professor? Ridiculous. I don't understand why the rest of the empire fears us. They should be more afraid of the mages," the voice continued. This was a discussion between Dolgyu and the person in charge of the healing room.
Yi-Han lay there, thinking to himself, 'This is my first time in the healing room.' Considering the frequent injuries at the magic academy, it was surprising he hadn't been there before. The last time he collapsed after fighting the anti-magic extremists, the skull principal had taken care of him, so a visit to the healing room hadn't been necessary. But today was different.
He observed that the healing room was more ordinary than he had expected. It was a clean, pristine white space with beds neatly arranged. However, what caught his attention was that the one in charge of the healing room was talking to Dolgyu in the form of a book. Yi-Han blinked in disbelief. The book, indeed floating and flapping in the air, was speaking to Dolgyu.
"The symptoms are due to experiencing a magic explosion at close range while already fatigued. He'll be fine now that I've applied healing," the book explained.
"Thank you! He seemed fine for a while even after the explosion, but then he suddenly collapsed... I thought something major related to his mana had happened," Dolgyu expressed his relief.
"He was fine even after the explosion?" the book asked, surprised. It was rare for someone to endure such an experience without immediate effects. Dolgyu, realizing the gravity of the situation, was equally shocked.
Yi-Han, feeling slightly betrayed by Dolgyu's astonishment, thanked the book for the treatment. As he coughed, the book introduced itself, "I am the demon of the healing room."
"...Excuse me?" Yi-Han asked, taken aback.
Yi-Han wasn't surprised to hear the book call itself a demon. Even if he was, he could now respond calmly and composedly. The magic school had indeed contributed to his growth.
"Ah, how dull... Other freshmen usually get startled," the book lamented.
"I'll guess then. Perhaps you were captured by the principal and forced to work here," Yi-Han conjectured.
"!!!"
The speaking book was startled. How did he know!?
"Remarkable! You're exceptionally perceptive."
"It's an overstatement," Yi-Han modestly waved his hand away. Anyone who had met the skeletal principal a few times could make such a deduction. Of course, Dolgyu, who was unaware of these circumstances, was greatly impressed.
"Right. I was summoned by Gonadaltes and trapped in this book form to work here."
Despite the book's voice not betraying any dissatisfaction, Dolgyu inquired, "It seems you are satisfied with working here?"
"Me? Satisfied?"
"Yes? But..."
"You think just because I sound cheerful, I'm not dissatisfied?"
Yi-Han interjected, unable to just stand by.
"Probably if you showed insincerity in your attitude, the principal would punish you," he deduced.
"Remarkable!"
The healing room's demon, also the talking book, was again surprised. Yi-Han understood his situation too well for a freshman.
Considering Gonadaltes' temperamental nature, it was highly likely that any grumbling in the healing room would result in torn pages.
"You're too insightful... Wait. You're not Gonadaltes in disguise, are you...?"
The talking book trailed off suspiciously, then immediately cast a spell.
"...Mana Detection!"
Startled by the immense mana emanating from Yi-Han, the book exclaimed, "Gonadaltes! It's really you!"
"No, it's not."
"Yi-Han just has a lot of mana!"
Thanks to Dolgyu's desperate interjection, the talking book ceased its suspicions. Though it continued to use various confirmation and detection spell several times afterward…
"I've been with him the whole time. He’s definitely not the principal."
"Fine. I believe you. But, freshman, keep in mind that Gonadaltes could switch places with your friend in the blink of an eye when you're not looking."
Dolgyu thought the talking book was joking. However, Yi-Han took the warning seriously.
'I really need to be careful.'
"Indeed, if it were Gonadaltes, he would have revealed his true identity the moment I used magic. He's not one to stay quiet... Freshman, I apologize for suspecting you."
"It's okay."
Yi-Han stood up from his seat. Thanks to the healing magic of the talking book, his body had recovered, and it seemed like the right time to leave.
"Wait. Take this with you."
The talking book handed Yi-Han a small leather pouch as he was about to leave.
"What is this?"
"Just a simple healing potion."
"But... I'm already healed, aren't I?"
Yi-Han was surprised. He felt completely fine, was there something else wrong?
"No. It's just a gift, a reason for you to visit more often."
Yi-Han felt a mix of gratitude and unease.



Chapter 121
The talking book, realizing the implication of its words, quickly tried to clarify. "Of course, I didn't mean to wish you harm. I just meant that you should visit often."
"Ah, I see," Yi-Han replied, his unease slightly assuaged. He then opened the leather pouch to discover objects resembling solid rock fragments inside. "These are Griffin's gallstones," the book informed him.
"Oh...!" Yi-Han exclaimed, recalling information from the alchemy books he had read. Griffin's gallstones were renowned for their powerful effect on mana recovery. Confirming his knowledge, Yi-Han remarked, "They have a powerful effect on mana recovery, don't they?"
"That's right. You know your stuff," the book responded, impressed with his knowledge. However, Yi-Han appeared disheartened. He had learned from Professor Uregor's class that potions for mana recovery had limited effect on him. Unless it was a potion for reducing mana, the effect of a recovery potion...
The talking book was surprised by Yi-Han's reaction. It was one thing to not know about the gallstones, but quite another to react with such disinterest despite knowing their value. "These are valuable, you know? They are genuine Griffin gallstones," the book emphasized.
"Thank you. But I've rarely been short on mana..." Yi-Han replied. Realizing Yi-Han's unique situation, the book finally understood why he was underwhelmed by the gift. A freshman with Yi-Han's amount of mana would seldom feel a shortage.
The book pondered, mentioning that it knew some demons with the ability to absorb mana, but quickly dismissed the idea as too dangerous. Yi-Han, taking the gallstones, decided to keep a safe distance from a demon summoned by the skull principal.
"You must visit often! Let's talk about Gonadaltes!" the book exclaimed, flapping its pages as Yi-Han left.
Dolgyu remarked, amazed at the kindness the demon book showed towards Yi-Han, attributing it to his talent, as demons naturally favor those with such qualities. However, Yi-Han felt their interaction was different. It seemed to him more like the book had no one else to complain to about the skull principal. Who else would dare to speak ill of the principal?
With these thoughts, Yi-Han felt a tinge of sympathy for the talking book, entangled as it was with the skull principal.
&lt;Basic Imperial Geometry and Arithmetic&gt;
Mathematics is the foundation of all disciplines, and this lecture was no exception. It was of great importance, encompassing topics from mana calculations to magic circle construction and the development of new spells. The more advanced the magic became, the less it relied on intuition and feeling. Understanding this, the students recognized the importance of this class and dedicated themselves to studying hard.
Yi-Han glanced around the classroom. 'Has a sleep spell been cast?' he wondered. The students had already succumbed to sleep, including Gainando, who was nodding off, snoring softly. The only ones still awake were Asan, who was pricking his hand with a quill, Adenart, who remained expressionless (Yi-Han had seen the princess cast a spell to ward off sleep on herself), and Yonaire.
Yi-Han took out some coffee and handed it to Yonaire, who received it as if it were the first coffee given to someone stranded in the mountains for months. "So sleepy..." Yi-Han empathized, nodding in agreement. The classroom air seemed to be getting thinner. Yonaire, having momentarily shifted her focus to doodle a water bottle on a geometric figure, turned to Yi-Han. Somehow, he seemed more upright than usual.
"You stayed up all night?" she inquired.
"Aren't you sleepy?" she added.
"It's impossible to sleep during such a sacred class, Yonaire," Yi-Han replied, his tone unexpectedly solemn.
Yonaire was baffled by her friend's odd response. Why was he reacting this way? She couldn't understand.
'I must look alert,' Yi-Han thought to himself, trying to appear more attentive. He widened his eyes, fighting the urge to sleep. The professor's voice, despite his determination, was incredibly soporific. Its unique rhythmic quality was almost hypnotic, lulling listeners into a state of sleepiness. If Yi-Han hadn't been aware of the professor's esteemed status, he might have suspected him of being a master of mental magic.
Professor Alpen Knighton, responsible for &lt;Basic Imperial Geometry and Arithmetic&gt;, was not your ordinary academic. Originally, he served as a senior administrative officer in the empire, a role that came with its own notorious reputation. He was well-known for slashing the research budgets of numerous mages, earning their enmity in the process. His metaphorical sword had been wielded so fiercely that even professors at the magic academy still harbored grudges against him.
However, Yi-Han's perspective was different. 'I must make a good impression...!' he thought to himself. Considering the professor's background as a senior administrative officer, one of the few such esteemed positions in the empire, Yi-Han recognized the potential benefits of making a good impression. Someone with such significant connections could open many doors. He imagined a conversation where the professor might say, “Wardanaz, you are precisely the kind of talent the empire needs. Come to the Empire after graduation! I'll recommend you.” and Yi-Han responding with a grateful, “Thank you, Professor!”
For Yi-Han, an ideal student-teacher relationship was one where a clean recommendation was followed by no further meetings, a stark contrast to the mutual loathing often observed in workshops. To achieve this, impressing Professor Alpen Knighton was crucial. Yet, Yi-Han observed, 'But he really seems uninterested in the students.' He considered the professor's demeanor, which epitomized an 'I'll go my way, you follow if you can' attitude. Professor Knighton appeared indifferent to whether the students grasped the lecture or not; he simply did his job. His self-satisfaction made him an even more challenging personality to impress.
'Similar to Professor Boladi, but difficult in a different way,' Yi-Han mused. Unlike Knighton, Professor Boladi wasn't indifferent to the students, or rather, to a particular student. In fact, his problem was excessive interest. He waited for students to catch up, albeit from a considerable distance, a different kind of challenge for Yi-Han to navigate.
"What are you pondering?"
"How can I catch the professor's eye?"
"...Isn't it enough?" Yonaire asked, her voice tinged with perplexity. Yi-Han, curious, responded.
"What do you mean by enough?"
"You attract enough attention from the professors, but too much might be burdensome for you..." Yonaire cautiously advised. She had never imagined before entering the academy that she would be giving such advice to a friend. Advising someone not to attract too much attention from the professors seemed like unusual counsel. Yet, seeing Yi-Han, a boy from the Wardanaz family, she felt compelled to offer this advice out of genuine concern.
"It's okay, Yonaire. This much is fine. And Professor Alpen Knighton is different from the others," Yi-Han reassured her.
"Hmm... if you say it's okay, I won't argue, but..." Yonaire couldn't shake off an inexplicable sense of foreboding. She wondered why it felt like her friend was unwittingly setting himself up for trouble.
Meanwhile, Professor Knighton had concluded his lecture. "…And with that. Remember this equation. It will be essential for calculating mana." His words signaled the end of the session.
Gainando, who had been dozing off, perked up at the phrase 'And with that,' looking around in disbelief. "It's over? Is it really over?"
"Then, let's proceed to a brief test now," the professor announced.
"...It's really over..." Gainando realized in a different sense that the class was indeed over, and, clutching his head in despair, he saw that the other students, previously asleep, were now awake and sharing his sense of dread.
"Lucky me."
"How is this lucky?!" Gainando couldn't hide his shock at Yi-Han's mumbling. He wondered if his friend had lost his sanity during his absence. Yi-Han, paying no heed to Gainando's reaction, was lost in thought. 'I will definitely catch Professor Knighton's eye in this test.' He was confident that in mathematics, at least, he would not be outdone by the other freshmen in the classroom. He was set on showing something extraordinary.
As the test began, a noticeable distance formed among the clustered students, and test papers started to appear before them. Yi-Han observed a transparent barrier, conjured by Professor Alpen, enclosing the space. Looking through it blurred his vision. 'Cunning will be difficult if you don't have magic,' Yi-Han thought. Since joining the magic academy, he had instinctively begun thinking of ways to counter any magic he encountered.
Professor Knighton's voice interrupted his thoughts. "If you've finished early, feel free to submit and leave." 'Naturally,' Yi-Han thought. "If you haven't finished, you cannot leave." This casual addendum to the professor's statement seemed almost trivial at first, but something about it struck Yi-Han as off. 'Can't leave if we don't finish everything?' The statement's explicitness felt unusual.
Yi-Han wasn't the only one pondering this; another student raised their hand to clarify. "Professor, do you mean we can't leave until we've filled in all the blanks?" "That's correct," the professor replied. The students sighed in relief, but it was short-lived. "...Correctly." The professor's additional comment changed everything.
"What... What happens if the answers are not correct?" a student asked, anxiety creeping into their voice. "One must solve it correctly before leaving," the professor answered bluntly, as if the question was trivial. It was then that the students realized the gravity of their situation, their faces turning pale. 'We can't leave until we get everything right?'
The students, now anxious, instinctively looked out the window. They had plans for the afternoon and evening, but those plans were now in jeopardy. Uncertain of how long Professor Alpen would keep them, thoughts raced through their minds. 'Surely not until night?' 'Do you still not understand this academy?' 'It won't be until tomorrow, right...?'
Frantically, Yi-Han began to write with his quill. It was no longer just about impressing the professor; it was about the ability to leave the classroom.
'I've roughly solved everything...'
Yi-Han surveyed his test paper, marked by circles that appeared magically each time he got an answer right. The test, enhanced by magic, presented a unique challenge. However, the last question was particularly perplexing:
One day, Gonadaltes received 3,892 imperial gold coins from the emperor to build the Vilteron ballroom. The following spells and reagents were used...
(Abridged)
...Given these spells and reagents, how many imperial gold coins remained with Gonadaltes?
'No matter how I think about it, 720 is the correct answer,' Yi-Han thought, utterly baffled. He had meticulously checked the magic circle, verified the amount of reagents, and even confirmed the labor costs. Yet, after all his recalculations, the answer remained the same. Why?
Looking around, he noticed other classmates, who had caught up with him, were also deeply engrossed in this final question. They seemed equally stumped.
'Was the problem not meant to be solved with the given information? Did it require prior knowledge, or a different approach?' Yi-Han pondered. Gonadaltes was the name of the skull principal's castle. Would the skull principal, if he received gold coins, have saved any to return to the emperor? 'It doesn't seem likely,' he thought.
In a moment of impulsiveness, Yi-Han wrote '0' on the answer sheet. It was a wild guess, as there was no penalty for a wrong answer. To his amazement, a circle appeared on the test paper, leaving Yi-Han stunned. 'What is this...??'
Professor Alpen, noticing Yi-Han had finished, remarked, "You're quicker than I thought. Well done. A perfect score, Mr. Wardanaz." Despite receiving the praise he sought, Yi-Han felt more confused than pleased.
"Professor..." he began.
"What is it?" Professor Alpen inquired.
"May I ask about the last question?"
"Ah." The professor, with a strict face now slightly softened by a smile, replied, "It seems you found it amusing. I wanted to bring a smile to the tired students with this test."
"...Oh..." Yi-Han, reflecting on this revelation, wondered if he needed to revise his strategy to catch the professor's eye.



Chapter 122
‘No, one shouldn't jump to conclusions about someone based on this.’ Yi-Han thought to himself that having a slightly twisted sense of humor was merely a minor flaw in this magic academy. He decided to focus on the positive attributes of the professor before him.
"That was truly entertaining. Like a refreshing breeze for me, weary from academy life..." Yi-Han mused aloud.
As Asan, who had also completed the task, stood up and approached, he overheard Yi-Han's words and paused, thinking to himself, 'What's entertaining about this?' He couldn't find anything enjoyable about the recent exam. Nonetheless, he greeted, "Good day, Professor. I am Asan of the Dargard family."
Upon noticing Asan, Professor Alpen took out his pocket watch to check the time and then spoke, "Hmm. I actually have something to discuss with the students who excelled in their grades... Follow me."
Asan wore a reluctant expression, not wanting to waste time talking with the professor after finally completing the exam.
"I will do so." Yi-Han, however, did not share Asan's sentiments. He interjected before Asan could even make an excuse, and Asan moved along, his steps heavy with reluctance.
"By the way, Asan. How did you solve the last problem?" Yi-Han inquired.
"I tried plugging in from 0 when I couldn't find the answer, and luckily... What about you, Wardanaz?" Asan asked, looking at Yi-Han, expecting he had solved it similarly.
Yi-Han nodded, "Of course, I solved it the same way." He resolved to respond similarly if asked by others, not wanting to appear too understanding of the skull principal.
Professor Alpen's room was quite antique, with dust-free books and everything in its proper place. "Take a seat," he instructed as the students sat down. With a wave of his staff, he filled teacups with tea. "You two students ranked first and second in this exam, quite impressive," he remarked.
"Thank you," they responded.
"Actually, a friend of mine from my time as an administrative officer is visiting the academy next week..." Professor Alpen began, capturing Yi-Han's attention. His eyes widened as he listened quietly. A friend from his administrative officer days likely meant someone of high imperial rank.
"...He wants to see the skills of my students. So, I'd like you to handle a simple magic circle creation. It shouldn't be too difficult, as I've mentioned in lectures," the professor continued. Yi-Han was elated at the opportunity, while Asan was visibly dismayed, wondering why they needed to take on extra work when their grades were already good. 'This is something I can handle,' Yi-Han thought confidently.
Yi-Han nodded, observing Asan's disliking reaction. He realized that he was well-graded and, more importantly, Asan didn't want to do it. It was the perfect opportunity for him.
"I think it would be good if Mr. Dargard took it on," Professor Alpen suggested.
"...?!" Yi-Han was taken aback. Why him?! "Me? Wouldn't it be better for Wardanaz?" Asan questioned, trailing off, his confidence waning. He didn't want to undertake such an extra task. Yi-Han silently cheered for Asan's persistence. 'Hang in there, Asan!' he thought.
"Well, Wardanaz has too much on his plate already," Professor Alpen reasoned.
"..." Both Yi-Han and Asan were left speechless, realizing the truth in the professor's words.
"I've heard he's so fervently focused on his studies that he's taking extra lessons from other professors. We can't disturb such a student," Professor Alpen noted. Asan, in a disheartened voice, accepted the task: "...Alright. I will do it..."
Asan had a conscience too. As a student of the Tower of the Blue Dragon, he couldn't simply ask Yi-Han, already burdened and struggling, to take on the task with a 'But still, you should do it!'
"No, Professor. I will help Asan," Yi-Han interjected.
"Is that alright?" the professor asked.
"Yes," Yi-Han affirmed.
"Wardanaz...!" Asan was so moved by Yi-Han's gesture that he was nearly brought to tears. He was touched that Yi-Han would help with this boring, uninteresting, and tedious task purely out of friendship.
Swoosh - Asan wiped away his tears with his sleeve, reflecting that since entering the academy, he seemed to cry more often.
"Thank you, Wardanaz," Asan expressed his gratitude.
"It's nothing, Asan," Yi-Han reassured him, patting Asan's shoulder. Inwardly, Yi-Han was thinking, 'I will definitely make a good impression.' Regardless of who Professor Alpen's friend was, Yi-Han was determined to leave a lasting impression.
After receiving a brief explanation, the two students bid farewell to the professor and left the room.
Left alone, Professor Alpen muttered regretfully, "What a pity. I originally wanted to recommend Wardanaz..." He pondered Yi-Han's talent and ability. The boy from the Wardanaz family was a candidate he had considered recommending to the imperial officials. With a brilliant mind and strong passion for academics, Yi-Han surely had the potential to become a fine bureaucrat for the Empire. However, Professor Alpen had his reservations. 'Such a talented individual should be left to focus on academics, not a bureaucratic position,' he thought. He knew that a reasonably brilliant mind fits a bureaucratic position in the Empire, but a truly brilliant one should be devoted to academics for the future of the Empire.
Having served a long time in a bureaucratic position before coming to this academy to nurture future talents of the Empire, Professor Alpen felt a mix of regret and joy. As a former official, it was regrettable, but as an educator, it was a source of joy. 'I will assist as much as I can, so you can focus on academics, Wardanaz,' he resolved.
Thursday.
As Yi-Han walked to his alchemy class, he noticed the other students looked exhausted. "What time did everyone leave the lecture hall yesterday?" he asked.
"After midnight... The magic wouldn't dispel," came the weary reply.
"..." Yi-Han absorbed the information in silence.
"What was the answer to the last question?" Yonaire inquired, still looking puzzled. He couldn't think of any other answer than 720 coins, no matter how much he pondered it.
"...0 coin," Yi-Han answered.
"Huh?" Yonaire was taken aback.
"0 coin," Yi-Han repeated.
"Why?"
"Well... it's like..." Yi-Han, despite not being the one who set the question, carefully explained, observing Yonaire's reaction.
Yonaire's eyes flared up with realization, like the flames used in metal refining. "Dead...! ...tard. That was it. Yes." She calmed herself down with difficulty. In this academy, one had to learn not to get upset over every little thing.
Squeak -
"Huh?" Yi-Han turned his head. The passing princess was tearing up a paper covered in various formulas and numbers, her face expressionless. She had been trying to solve yesterday's problem even until today.
"...I feel somewhat guilty," Yi-Han admitted.
"Why? It's not your fault. Don't worry about it," Yonaire comforted him. The girl from the Maykin family changed the topic. "You're making a magic circle with Dargard, right?"
"Yes," Yi-Han confirmed.
"...Wouldn't it be better to just let Dargard do it alone?" she suggested.
"Hey... Maykin..." Asan, passing by, looked at Yonaire with a sense of grievance. Yonaire's words weren't wrong, after all. Even other students from different towers seemed to echo Yonaire's sentiment, suggesting, "Wouldn't it be better to do it alone?" and "Dargard. You should consider Wardanaz."
"..." Asan looked at Yi-Han, as if asking for help. Yi-Han nodded and replied, "I decided to help because I wanted to, so everyone need not worry."
"If that's the case, but..."
"Why not ask that prince for help? He seemed to have plenty of time."
Thud, thud, thud -
Professor Uregor entered the classroom, his footsteps resonating like beating a cauldron. "Good to see you all. You all know what we're going to do today, don't you?" he greeted, his presence immediately souring the students' faces. Even when the test was the same, Professor Uregor had a unique way of making it more irksome.
Sensing the students' gaze, Professor Uregor chuckled heartily. "Alright. Line up and come in one by one," he instructed.
"?!" The students murmured, surprised by this unexpected format of the test. They had anticipated the usual method of making potions in the classroom using a cauldron.
"What's the matter? Line up and come in as I said," Professor Uregor urged.
"..." The students, casting suspicious glances at Professor Uregor, lined up. They were clueless about what lay behind the door of the classroom.
"What's in there?" one student whispered.
"A monster, maybe?" another guessed.
"In an alchemy class?" a third questioned skeptically.
"Then what about the first day when that crazy monster attacked?" another recalled.
"...That was also an alchemy class. Damn. There might be a monster after all," a student concluded.
Quickly steeling themselves and gripping their staffs, the students prepared for the worst. The likelihood of facing a monster now seemed high.
'Surely there won't be a monster... right?' Yi-Han thought, not losing a shred of hope. He handed out candies to his friends.
"What's this?" they asked.
"Beer candies. Eat them if you run low on mana," Yi-Han explained.
His friends nodded solemnly, storing the beer candies. These were essential items, given the uncertainty of how much mana they might need against a potential monster.
"Wardanaz. Come in," Professor Uregor called.
Yi-Han opened the door and stepped inside. To his relief, no monster attacked, but he remained vigilant.
"...You can take your hand off your waist," Professor Uregor said as he looked at Yi-Han as if he couldn't believe it.
It was good to be cautious, but Yi-Han's readiness to draw a sword during an alchemy exam was bordering on the absurd. Was he there for a swordsmanship test? "Professor. I trust you," Yi-Han said, trying to reassure himself.
"I think I've said this before, but those who really trust don't say such things. Now, look at the cauldron and the ingredients beside it," Professor Uregor instructed.
Yi-Han examined the cauldron and the unfamiliar ingredients placed beside it. "I've seen them," he affirmed.
"Now, using only the ingredients in this room, try to make this potion," Professor Uregor challenged, shaking a glass bottle with an unknown potion.
"?" Yi-Han hesitated, looking at the potion he had never seen before.
"Is it a potion you've taught us in lectures?" Yi-Han asked.
"No," the professor replied.
"Could you tell me what kind of potion it is?" Yi-Han inquired further.
"No," Professor Uregor answered again, a broad smile on his face, clearly enjoying the situation.
A skilled alchemist excelled in improvisation, able to make a similar potion using only unknown ingredients without knowing the identity of the potion. This test was about quickly understanding the properties of the ingredients and incorporating their effects in their mind. Professor Uregor didn't expect the freshmen to create a perfect potion but to discern the properties of many potions and create something as similar as possible.
"Come on, better move quickly, right? Time isn't infinite," the professor urged.
"Hmm," Yi-Han mused, engrossed in thought.
As Yi-Han, one of the brightest students in the alchemy lectures, remained motionless and contemplative, Professor Uregor grew puzzled. 'What is he pondering?' It was baffling to see him so deep in thought when he should be quickly identifying the properties of the ingredients and the potion.
"Why is that?" Professor Uregor asked.
"May I use anything from within the room?" Yi-Han inquired, pondering a strategy for the test.
"Planning to use your own ingredients?" Professor Uregor asked, a hint of skepticism in his voice. He snorted, doubting the usefulness of whatever ingredients Yi-Han might have. However, he was prepared to acknowledge them if Yi-Han happened to have something useful. After all, such luck would justify allowing him to do as he pleased.
"Do as you wish," Professor Uregor conceded.
"Understood," Yi-Han responded. With a burst of speed, he dashed like lightning and snatched the potion right from Professor Uregor's hand.
Caught completely off guard by this sudden ambush, Professor Uregor stood frozen in shock for a moment before regaining his composure. "Hey!!!" he exclaimed, surprised by Yi-Han's bold move.



Chapter 123
"That's not right!!" Professor Uregor protested.
"Yes?" Yi-Han questioned.
"I said you could use all the ingredients in this room, but just snatching the potion and submitting it, don't you think that's nonsensical?" Professor Uregor protested. Yi-Han hesitated for a moment before looking at Professor Uregor as if he were a strange person.
Feeling slightly embarrassed, Professor Uregor asked again, "...Wasn't that your plan?"
"No, it wasn't. I mean, who would just snatch a potion and submit it like that? Really, Professor..." Yi-Han replied, leaving Professor Uregor feeling somewhat sheepish and then suddenly irate.
'Is this kid really snatching the potion with force and then acting like this?' Professor Uregor thought. The idea that a student who had just forcefully taken a potion from his grasp was now treating him as if he were the odd one was utterly baffling. If it weren't for the potential that the student might become the Empire's greatest swordsman, Professor Uregor would have slapped him.
"Then why did you take it?" he asked.
"I took it to analyze the potion more accurately. I thought it was unlikely that you would give it to me if I asked," Yi-Han explained.
"Hmm..." Professor Uregor mumbled. It was a valid point. He had no intention of giving the potion to the students even if they asked.
However, just because it was a valid point didn't mean it wasn't annoying. Professor Uregor found his student particularly irksome today.
"Hmph. Let's see how well you do," Professor Uregor said, crossing his arms and glaring at Yi-Han.
Snatching the potion was unexpected, but replicating it would still be a challenging task. Even if Yi-Han had the potion in hand, analyzing and understanding its properties was an entirely different matter.
'Surely he's not foolish enough to just drink it...' Professor Uregor worried.
Of course, the clever boy from the Wardanaz family wouldn't do that, but it was also true that he occasionally did crazy things nonchalantly.
He wouldn't be surprised if Yi-Han just drank it!
Contrary to Professor Uregor's worries, Yi-Han approached the task very methodically.
'What about this method?' Yi-Han thought.
He took a few drops of the potion from the bottle and spread them on the ground. Then, he waved his wand and chanted a spell.
"Components, separate."
'He learned that magic!' Professor Uregor was surprised.
&lt;Components Separation&gt; magic.
It was a spell used to forcibly separate the ingredients in things like potions. While it was a convenient spell that any alchemist would use, Professor Uregor had deliberately not taught it. To become an outstanding alchemist, one needed the passion to seek and learn on their own. A student spoon-fed by a professor could never become an outstanding alchemist.
Yi-Han, in line with Professor Uregor's educational philosophy, had independently searched the library and learned the magic.
Seeing this, Professor Uregor nodded his head.
'What an annoying kid!' Professor Uregor silently hoped that Yi-Han would fail the magic spell and end up inhaling acrid smoke, coughing uncontrollably. Fortunately, the &lt;Component Separation&gt; magic was not an easy spell. If one knew the exact ingredients inside, it was easier to separate them, but otherwise, it was challenging. Magic wasn't a universal key that solved everything just by chanting a spell. The same magic could vary greatly depending on the knowledge and skill of the mage using it. Unless Yi-Han was going to forcibly separate the ingredients by pouring an excessive amount of mana...
"Ah," Professor Uregor realized belatedly, as he noticed the potion drops slowly separating on the ground.
'It's working better than I thought.' Yi-Han and Yonaire were the students most dedicated to alchemy in the tower. To analyze the potions stolen by Ratford, learning the &lt;Component Separation&gt; magic was inevitable. It was a spell Yi-Han had discovered while flipping through an alchemy book, painstakingly learning it from various other books. He had been worried about whether it would work, but fortunately, the spell was more effective than expected. The potion drops split into smaller droplets of various colors.
Yi-Han looked up at Professor Uregor. 'Hmm. It seems to have worked well.' Judging by Professor Uregor's very displeased expression, it was clear that the spell had been successful.
"I'll give you credit for separating the potion like that," Professor Uregor conceded.
"Thank you," Yi-Han responded.
"But that's not enough. You won't be able to identify the separated components!"
"Ah. Isn't this a potion of confidence?"
"????" Professor Uregor was taken aback. How did he know?!
Nillia, who had finished her exam before Yi-Han, was chatting with Ratford. "Did you manage to match the color? That's impressive."
"I was just lucky," Ratford replied modestly.
"I don't think I managed to get it even close..."
"Don't worry about it. This was a test no one could achieve a perfect result on. The professor would have seen your process," Ratford comforted Nillia, who nodded, seemingly reassured.
"But why did you leave me out and roam the night academy last time?"
"......" Ratford broke into a nervous sweat.
"Well, I told you, didn't I? Tutanta of the Salko family only travels with his trusted subordinates. I was called as a guide. Wardanaz didn't know about it either. If it were just us, I would have definitely invited you."
"Ah. Right. That's true," Nillia nodded, convinced.
After talking about the alchemy class for about ten minutes, Nillia asked again, "But couldn't you have called me before leaving?"
"..." Ratford involuntarily glanced at the door.
'When will Mr. Wardanaz come out?'
He couldn't persuade her; it had to be Yi-Han.
"What do you think? Huh? What's your opinion?"
"Well... Salko has a bit of a temper..." Ratford didn't really have a grudge against Salko, but in the current situation, he had no choice but to paint him in a bad light.
"He didn't give me a chance to..."
"Like last time at the island, too. After everything was prepared, he went with the friends from the White Tiger, right? What do you think about that?"
"Well... the guys from White Tiger are known to be rough and deceitful..." Ratford didn't bear any particular ill will towards them either, but once again, he had no choice.
"From Mr. Wardanaz's perspective, it must have been unavoidable."
"I suppose that was an unavoidable situation too, right?"
"Yes. So, let's drop this topic now..."
"Right. ...Have I been complaining too much?" Realizing she might have been grumbling, Nillia asked. Ratford quickly shook his head.
"No?"
"Good. Then that's a relief."
Nillia then spent another fifteen minutes talking about alchemy - about the recent exam, the assignments, and speculations about the midterms... Other students from the Black Tortoise who had completed their exams also joined the conversation, sharing their opinions. With the topic now completely shifted, Ratford breathed a sigh of relief.
"But this isn't about me, it's about a friend of mine. He says that students from the other towers keep forgetting him and wandering off."
"..." Ratford hung his head low.
Unaware of the exact situation, the students from the Black Tortoise joined the conversation seriously.
"Maybe it's because it's a different tower? People from other towers are basically rude, arrogant, or haughty."
"At least the Immortal Phoenix is better."
"The guys from the White Tiger are really unlucky."
While Ratford was pondering how to change the subject, Yi-Han emerged from the door. Ratford was as relieved to see Yi-Han as if he had been given a warm soup after days of hunger.
"Mr. Wardanaz...!" 'Was the exam that difficult?' Yi-Han was slightly taken aback as Ratford called out to him with a voice filled with emotion.
"What's the matter?"
"Please explain to Miss Nillia about what happened last time."
"Why, Ratford? I told you I understood everything." Nillia reprimanded Ratford without changing her expression, as if asking what he was talking about. Ratford opened his mouth in a mix of frustration and disbelief, looking at Nillia. 'Is that really the behavior of someone who understands everything...!?'
Yi-Han quickly grasped the situation, having been prepared for such a scenario ever since the night he roamed the academy with Salko from the Tutanta family. "Nillia, Salko was a bit too much. I asked if we could invite you, but he strongly objected."
"!"
"?"
Ratford tilted his head, puzzled. Had such a conversation ever taken place? “I heard that other friends lose confidence when they have a skilled hunter like you.”
"Really?"
Nillia's long ears perked up and lifted slightly. Yi-Han nodded solemnly, convincing even Ratford, who felt as if such a conversation might have actually happened. "Yonaire wasn't allowed to come either. Salko went too far, didn't he? But don't be too hard on him. He did it for the sake of his friends."
"...Right. I see now!" Nillia responded, her face noticeably brighter than before, and her ears were much higher.
Ratford whispered quietly, "Did you really have that conversation?"
"Shh. Keep it down."
"..."
The students from the Black Tortoise called out to Yi-Han. "Mr. Wardanaz, how was the exam? Did you manage to create the perfect potion?"
"Of course not. It was an impossible exam to begin with. I failed." Hearing Yi-Han's words, the other students felt relieved. If even Yi-Han, the top student, said so, they felt a bit better about their own performance. Maybe it wasn't as bad as they thought!
"Did anyone notice any specific properties? I smelled a pungent odor, so I tried adding Findensis."
"Really? I tried to match the color, focusing on similar hues..." While the students were discussing, Yi-Han listened quietly.
Soon after, Yonaire, the last to take the exam, walked out of the door. "You all did well. Though the potions you made would be dangerous to sell anywhere, you did work hard." Professor Uregor's words earned him a glare from the students. The dwarf professor chuckled as if amused.
"Honestly, the exam was too difficult, Professor!"
"Shouldn't it at least be within what we've learned?"
"Even Mr. Wardanaz failed, who could pass it!" The students desperately protested, worried about such an exam appearing in their midterms.
Listening with a smile, Professor Uregor retorted, seemingly puzzled by their complaints. "What are you talking about? Wardanaz almost succeeded."
"What?"
"He almost succeeded. There was a minor difference, but it was still a success. The highest score." The students from the Black Tortoise, who had just been conversing among themselves, swiftly turned their heads to look for Yi-Han. However, Yi-Han had already left the room and was nowhere to be seen.
Professor Uregor clicked his tongue in disapproval, remarking, "To trust the words of a friend who studies better than you all. How naive."
"...Ugh...!"
"Mr. Wardanaz...! We believed in you...!"
Yi-Han, immersed in thought, read through the notes he had written on a piece of paper. Currently, the freshmen at the magic academy were spreading out like ink droplets dissolved in water. And Yi-Han was the most active in exploring the academy. He had noted several interesting locations:

The haunted corridor on the 2nd floor of the main building, west wing (Unresolved) - Rumored to have a storeroom for fabrics piled up by the academy.

The locked dungeon on the basement floor of the main building (Resolved) - Connected to the professor's office. Do not approach.

Main building…

‘Interesting as these are, I still want to check out the path to the stables in the spire first.’ As Yi-Han was busy drawing maps and jotting down notes on the paper, Gainando, who was watching him, asked, "But are you okay with Professor Garcia's exam?"
"A bit anxious, but I've mostly prepared."
"..."
Gainando stared at Yi-Han as if he were looking at a monster, then muttered to himself, "The Wardanaz family... truly fearsome!"
"It's not really about the Wardanaz family, is it?"



Chapter 124
In truth, the Wardanaz family had little to do with this, but Gainando was adamant. "It's certain that such habits were forcibly taught by the Wardanaz family. Otherwise, why would anyone study so diligently on their own?" 'You should study a bit...' The friend from the Tower of the Blue Dragon looked at Gainando with pity and walked away.
Gainando, although not overly concerned about grades thanks to his family's influence, was perhaps a bit too lax. Even the students of the Tower of the Blue Dragon, who weren't particularly focused on studies, thought, 'Isn't that a bit too much play?' Study a bit!
"Alright, let's go." Yi-Han finished organizing and tucked his hand-drawn map into his backpack. It wasn't just a map he packed. Sharply honed daggers, nails, hammers, and other tools, along with sturdy ropes and torches he made himself from oil-soaked rags, were also put in the backpack. And a glass bottle of frequently used oil, canned food for emergencies, a glass bottle of sugar, and a leather water flask... Yi-Han's movements were skilled and precise, showing his experience. ...He did wonder if all this was really necessary for exploring within the academy.
"Are you really going out?"
"Yes."
Moved by Yi-Han's confidence, especially with Professor Garcia's exam tomorrow, Gainando admired him. How splendid! 'That's a true noble!' Being obsessed with grades and studying frantically was not befitting of a noble. A true noble should know how to throw books aside and venture out.
Of course, technically, Yi-Han was going out after finishing his studies... But Gainando chose to ignore that fact.
"Let me come with you."
"Hmm?" Yi-Han was slightly surprised by Gainando's reaction. He hadn't expected Gainando to ask to join him.
"Is that alright?"
"Of course. I can't just sit by if my friend is heading into danger."
"You just don’t want to study, right?"
"......" Gainando, hit right on the mark, fell silent. If he stayed in the lounge, he'd definitely be nagged by passersby with remarks like 'Aren’t you studying?' or 'What's with the card game, there's a quiz coming up, study instead'. It was better to follow Yi-Han than to be scolded for no reason.
"No... not really."
"It seems so... But it's okay, come along." With Yi-Han's permission, Gainando excitedly put on his coat.
Asan entered and asked, "Gainando, you don't need to study?"
"Ah, stop asking!"
"I just asked once..."
The reason Yi-Han wanted to check the spire's stables first was indeed for a means of escape. He had a promise with Amur, the owner of the stables outside the magic academy.
-When the evil Lich falls and the crimson dawn arrives, look up at the eastern spire!
'...Hmm. On second thought, that conversation wasn’t as dramatic.' Memories tend to distort over time, but this seemed a bit too distorted. In reality, stable owner Amur had promised to fly to the academy every two weeks. He hadn't yet acquired a flying mount, but it was wise to familiarize himself with the path to the stables beforehand. And who knows? He might find a clue to acquire a mount on his way to the spire's stables. 'If it's as per the promise, he should be coming this weekend. I wonder if I'll meet him.'
"It's really nice to gather like this, isn't it?" Nillia asked. Yi-Han and Yonaire quickly nodded in agreement. Gainando stood there blankly until Yi-Han pinched his back, prompting him to quickly nod in agreement.
"I'm so, so happy to be wandering around with a reliable guide like Nillia, instead of a filthy friend from the Tutanta family. Right, Yonaire?"
"Of course. I'm also really, really happy."
"I'm really, really happy too."
Thanks to the flattery from Yi-Han, Yonaire, and Ratford in succession, Nillia's mood seemed to have noticeably improved.
'I wish there were some other guys from the Black Tortoise here. It'd be more comfortable.' Yi-Han regretted their absence. Since the Salko gang had agreed to use each other, he had no reason to feel sorry no matter the situation. Even if the Skull Principal appeared and one of the Salko gang was thrown as bait to escape, there was no need for apologies, as it was all pre-agreed. ...Of course, whether the Salko gang thought the same was uncertain. Anyway, that's what Yi-Han thought.
In contrast, Nillia couldn't be discarded. Yi-Han found that regrettable. 'Should I have brought one or two of them along?' But if he asked to borrow one or two from the Salko gang, Salko himself would get involved, and if Salko joined, Nillia would seek revenge for last time's abandonment... Rather than complicating things, Yi-Han thought it best to just bring people he could trust.
"Managing relationships between people is really tough, Ratford."
"???"
Surprised by Yi-Han's sudden remark, Ratford quickly nodded in agreement. Indeed, in the world of thieves, relationships were unexpectedly important. A thief who only cared about themselves and had many enemies wouldn't last long.
"You're right."
"I wish I had one or two friends to take the lead in case of trouble. Like the Salko gang."
"Uhm. But Miss Nillia isn't exactly fond of the Salko gang..."
"Yeah, I know."
Yi-Han finished speaking and looked at Gainando thoughtlessly. Ratford also glanced at Gainando inadvertently. Then the two secretly exchanged glances.
"Gainando. It's reassuring to have you here."
"Huh? Why? What's up?"
Nillia and Ratford were both exceptional guides. One was an expert outdoors, and the other, indoors. That was the only difference. Given the complexity of the magic academy's corridors and staircases, Ratford naturally played a more prominent role.
"Just wait a moment, please." Ratford stretched out his hand to stop his friends, then leaned close to the corridor floor with his ear. Yi-Han and his group were searching for a way to ascend from the cut-off second-floor corridor. According to the map, this path should lead to the third floor, but there was no visible way.
"Umm... It's over there! I hear the sound of stairs moving in that direction."
"...I can do that too..." As Nillia was about to belatedly lie down in the corridor, Yi-Han stopped her. "Nillia. There's no need to show your skills now. Better to save them for later!"
"I think so too!" As Yi-Han and Yonaire restrained her by pulling her up, Nillia stood up, looking a bit disappointed. Meanwhile, the stairs slowly approached. The group ascended the stairs to the third floor.
'This is a new direction for me.' Yi-Han had been guided by Salko to the main building's third floor before, but it was a completely different direction. Yi-Han had no idea what awaited them on the third floor in this direction.
Click- With a heavy sound, the stairs connected. Yi-Han stepped forward, heading to the third floor. One step. Two steps. Three steps forward.
And then, Yi-Han realized that the scenery around him had changed from the corridors, windows, and ceilings of the main building of the magic academy to a dense, lush forest.
"...?!" Yi-Han knew that the magic academy contained all sorts of natural landscapes, but he had never expected to witness such a change within the main building itself. Despite knowing that skilled mages could expand and rearrange spaces, Yi-Han had been trapped in his preconceptions and had not considered this possibility.
The main building of the magic academy was a place with a deep history, so deep that even the principal might not know everything about it. It wouldn't have been surprising to find forests, volcanoes, or even polar regions inside.
"Amazing. To think there was such a forest on the third floor... Nillia, I'm counting on you." Yi-Han said, looking to his side. Finally, a situation had arisen where Nillia could shine. Yi-Han was almost too happy.
But Nillia was not there beside him. "???"
Meow. Looking down, Yi-Han saw a black cat scratching at his ankles. Even Yi-Han, who had become quite familiar with the academy, was perplexed by the current situation.
"Where did everyone go...?"
Surprisingly, not one of the friends who had ascended to the third floor with him on the moving staircase was in sight. Yi-Han immediately drew his staff and surveyed the forest around him.
Meow. Meow.
The cat, as if it had something to say, kept tapping Yi-Han's ankle with its front paws. Yi-Han suddenly wondered if it could be Nillia. "...Could it be you, Nillia?" The black cat meowed and nodded its head repeatedly, clearly agreeing.
'Polymorph!' Not just any forest, but a forest that cast a polymorph spell, forcibly transforming anyone who stepped into it into an animal. Yi-Han felt a chill. 'Wait. Why wasn't I affected?' Considering that all his friends had transformed, it was strange that Yi-Han was the only one unaffected. 'Maybe it's because of my mana.' Whenever he encountered something different from others at the magic academy, suspecting his innate mana usually turned out to be correct 99% of the time.
Yi-Han decided to find his other friends with Nillia first. "Sharakan. Help me find the others." The bone summon, which had been sleeping on his belt, clattered as it took shape and ran ahead. Nillia pressed her paws into Yi-Han. "Nillia. Easy... Why?" Nillia pointed her paws at the bone summon, raising them as if to threaten. "You think the others will get scared and run away when they see the bone summon?" Nillia nodded.
Yi-Han fell into thought for a moment. "We need to catch them before they see it and run away."
...
Nillia was so dumbfounded that she was at a loss for words.
Fortunately, the other friends were quickly found. A bat perched on a branch flew hurriedly towards Yi-Han when it saw him (Yi-Han thought it might be Ratford), and a bushy red fox (probably Yonaire) followed the bone summon.
"Where did Gainando go?" The other friends responded with various animal cries. Yi-Han nodded his head. 'Hmm. It's better to just think on my own.' It turned out that getting answers from his friends wasn't always helpful.
Sharakan, the incomplete bone summon, sniffed around and persistently led Yi-Han. Walking through the verdant forest path, they arrived at a large clearing. Having met a tree spirit in a forest inside a mountain range before, Yi-Han speculated that there might be a tree spirit in this clearing as well. "Seems like a spirit might be needed to maintain and inhabit such a forest within the academy."
However, Yi-Han's prediction was off the mark. At the center of the clearing was a mouse. Clatter, clatter - The bone summon Sharakan lowered its stance, sending a wary gaze toward the mouse. It wasn't just Sharakan who noticed. Yi-Han also felt the powerful magic emanating from the mouse. 'Does this magic academy have any normal plants or animals?'
The mouse, whipping its tail, cast a spell. Then, the bushes surrounding Yi-Han sank down, and the trees on either side were pushed away. "...!" While Yi-Han marveled, the mouse engraved letters on the ground with its magic. Forest. Passage. Duel. Victory. Loser. Return. "To pass through the forest, one must win in a duel, and if defeated, simply return?" The mouse nodded its head. Then, it raised its head and looked at Yi-Han.
Squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak! The mouse, startled by the sight of Yi-Han who had not transformed, fell backward in surprise.



Chapter 125
Upon witnessing the fallen mouse, Yi-Han unwittingly blurted out a defense. "I am not a dragon, a lich, nor the academy principal," he claimed. His nearby friends looked at him as if he was speaking nonsense. The red fox stretched its front paw forward as if to say, look ahead.
The mouse, startled, quickly got up and began to flee. "Wait! You proposed a duel! With the honor of a noble..." Yi-Han, habitually invoking honor, suddenly paused mid-sentence. It dawned on him that this trick only worked on his friends at the Blue Dragon Tower. For those, he could trick them by saying words like:
-"As a noble, clean up the mess you've made."-
-"As a noble, look up information about reagents in books."-
-"As a noble, would you dare walk over that trap?"-
However, talking about a noble's honor to a mouse was futile. Yi-Han swiftly changed his approach. "Behave honorably, as a mouse should!" The mouse, unheeding, scampered into the forest. The red fox gazed at Yi-Han with a look of pity. Being an animal, its gaze seemed all the more piercing.
"We have no choice but to pursue," he concluded. It was clear that this mouse was the ruler of this forest. Though Yi-Han couldn't fathom why the mouse would learn magic to become the forest's ruler, he accepted it. This was, after all, a magic academy.
"Stop there! I challenge you to a duel!" Chasing the mouse and shouting for a duel filled him with a sense of self-reproach, but that wasn't important now. Sharakan rustled as it trailed the mouse's path. Sensing it was being pursued, the mouse retaliated. "!" Suddenly, a vine with berries transformed into a ferocious Bald Eagle.
Yi-Han reacted immediately. "Space, be perceived. And... spring forth!" As he recited the &lt;Spatial Perception&gt; spell, the situation around Yi-Han swiftly imprinted itself in his mind. The trajectory of the fleeing mouse was almost visible to the naked eye. A large mass of water materialized rapidly, transforming into a bead of water that orbited him according to his will. Starting from a simple 1st Circle &lt;Water Creation&gt; spell, it quickly evolved into complex shape transformation and motion maintenance.
Yonaire, the red fox, stood by, astonished, raising its tail in surprise. '!?' It was shocking to see a friend advancing so far ahead in water magic learning. Yi-Han had always been proficient in water magic, but this was faster, more complex, and more refined than what she had seen before. Was this really okay?
"Worry not. I can handle it!" Yi-Han reassured, misinterpreting his friends' shocked reactions, and attacked the Bald Eagle. The water bead, heavy and sharp, struck the eagle, which with a loud bang, reverted back to a bush. "Sharakan. Capture it! Don't let it escape!" With splashing sounds, a nearby spring began to bubble and rise. The accumulated water took on the form of a large slime, preparing to attack.
"Flash forth!" Yi-Han swiftly swung his staff, casting &lt;Lightning Creation&gt;. Though a 1st Circle spell, lightning was the most destructive and rapid of the elements, making it apt for this situation. Crack! The lightning struck the spring slime, but it remained unscathed. Its large size seemed to protect it from harm, as it attempted to move again.
Yi-Han focused his mana, preparing his next move. "Strike down, Ferkuntra's Thunderbolt!" While a 2nd Circle spell, the power of Ferkuntra, a mighty lightning spirit, made it incomparable even to higher circle spells… However, this fact was known only to Ferkuntra, and Yi-Han still harbored doubts about this magic. Strangely, every time he used this magic, the effects were underwhelming. "If it's ineffective this time too, I'll seal it away for a while." In truth, the foes Yi-Han encountered were too formidable for a mere freshman. But Yi-Han's mind was already made up. In his mind, Ferkuntra seemed like a spirit prone to exaggeration!
Crackling fiercely, the lightning intensified as it struck the spring slime. The slime violently thrashed, part of it evaporating to the point of reducing its size. Yet, the spring slime stood its ground. "Ferkuntra!" Yi-Han cursed the absent spirit and drew out the Morning Star.
Nillia, in a panic, tried to stop Yi-Han with a mewling sound. ‘It's already down!’ The spring slime was clearly defeated due to the powerful magic. Its motionlessness was proof enough. Its continued standing was merely a residual effect of the magic, keeping the water from the spring in shape. But Nillia's cries fell on deaf ears.
Yi-Han slashed the downed spring slime with the Morning Star. Only then did the water lose its form and scatter. "It seems I've been tricked by the spirit," Yi-Han exclaimed.
"..."
The mouse cast transformation magic while frantically fleeing. But the intruder, who looked like a freshman, whether a principal or a dragon, adeptly dealt with and pursued it. That was even more suspicious. If it really were a freshman, such skilled pursuit would be impossible. Even the Bald Eagle was one thing, but to swiftly deal with a slime created from the water of the Cold Iron Water spring... It was clear that this was the skull principal in disguise.
The mouse trembled with fear. Whether a monster, demon, angel, or spirit, the professors of this magic academy seldom paid attention to those who set up nests in corners, but occasionally, if someone irked a professor, they would personally come to remove them. This was evidently one of those times. The mouse couldn't understand. What had it done to upset the skull principal? It had merely set up a forest in a corridor corner and played with freshmen... It seemed hardly a significant transgression.
Clatter! Sharakan leaped out, blocking the mouse's path with the sound of bones clashing. The mouse, terrified, tried to cast another spell, but Yi-Han was quicker. "Move!" Yi-Han instantly cast a &lt;Lesser Control&gt; spell, levitating the mouse, preventing its escape. The mouse, incredulous at being levitated by a mere 1st Circle spell suitable for novices, retaliated by transforming... Squeak?!
The mouse was shocked. It felt as though a tremendous mana had seized it, rendering it immobile. Even attempts to cast spells were futile. The opponent was controlling the area around the mouse with an immense amount of mana, leaving no room for other magic to penetrate. Such needless control from a 1st Circle spell meant for levitating mere quills. There was only one explanation. The skull principal's unique and eccentric intimidation tactics! Squeak... The mouse shook its head to the side, as if giving up.
Yi-Han was taken aback. ‘Did I... kill it?’ For a moment, he thought he had overdone the &lt;Lesser Control&gt; spell. But upon reflection, &lt;Lesser Control&gt; shouldn't have such effects. Its sole purpose was to levitate and control. Fortunately, upon closer inspection, the mouse was not dead. It seemed to have simply given up.
"Look. I really am not..." Yi-Han hesitated as he tried to explain to the mouse that he was neither a dragon, nor a lich, nor the skull principal. Did he really need to clarify? Considering the magic the mouse had used earlier, despite its panic, it was evidently a much more skilled mage than Yi-Han. Had it not fled and instead attacked using various transformation magics, it might well have defeated him. Moreover, if the misunderstanding was cleared, wouldn't the mouse feel compelled to attack Yi-Han fiercely, out of indignation for having fled?
But what if the mouse continued to believe Yi-Han was the skull principal? 'Wouldn't that allow me to quickly escape the forest?' It wasn't the first time he had done something like this. Hadn't he previously evaded the warehouse keeper's eye underground by imitating the skull principal? His friends looked at him quizzically. 'Is he pondering how to persuade the mouse?'
"Yes. I am indeed the principal." Squeak! The mouse, which had been cautiously peeking at Yi-Han with one eye, now tightly shut both eyes and lay back, as if expecting this.
"..."
"..."
Yi-Han felt the stares of his friends, who had transformed into animals, but he ignored them. "However, out of mercy... If you let me and these friends of mine leave, I'll overlook making you one of my undead minions." Yi-Han spoke in as ominous a tone as he could muster. He wasn't exactly sure what 'undead minions' were, but he said whatever came to mind.
The mouse nodded its head fervently, as if a gust of wind had been created. Squeak, squeak, squeak! It seemed desperate to get rid of the supposed skull principal, frantically indicating the direction. Yi-Han and his friends followed the forest path. Soon, they began to see the familiar corridors of the academy in the distance.
"Ah. Wait." Yi-Han and his friends paused as they were about to leave. The mouse looked at Yi-Han with shocked eyes. Could it be? "No. There's one more person. Just a moment." He had forgotten about Gainando.
Yi-Han went back in to find Gainando. The white mouse burst into tears upon seeing Yi-Han, clinging to him. "Gainando." His friends nodded in confirmation. Yi-Han placed the white mouse on his staff.
Gainando, tearful and moved at the sight of his friends, panicked upon seeing Nillia. Squeak, squeak, squeak! "Huh?" Yi-Han looked at Nillia and then back at Gainando. "It's okay. She won't bite." Of course, Gainando didn't hear that. He hid in the pocket of the coat. Instead of forcing Gainando out, Yi-Han just removed some beer candies from the pocket and placed them elsewhere.
"Well then, farewell, mouse of the forest. If I ever pass through here again, let's meet." Yonaire, who was listening, tilted her head. Was that a threat? Indeed, the mouse seemed to take it as such, trembling. Eventually, the mouse squeaked and unearthly dug up a treasure from the forest floor. It was a mystical bone imbued with abundant mana. Squeak, squeak... The mouse looked pitifully at Yi-Han, as if to say, take this and spare me.
Of course, Yi-Han had no interest in the bone. Maybe Professor Mortum would have... Clatter! At that moment, Sharakan pounced. Bones tangled messily, then the gaps in Sharakan were filled. "…!" As the skull summon transformed into a complete form, his friends marveled at the wonder of summoning magic.
Yi-Han, meanwhile, was lost in thought. "...How dangerous did Professor Bungaegor say Sharakan was?" According to the professor, Sharakan was a very proud and violent creature. While currently incomplete and thus docile, achieving completeness might bring out its original, more aggressive nature! "Should I bank on the slim chance that Professor Mortum took a freshman's capabilities into consideration, or the more evident possibility that he overlooked safety protocols?" Naturally, it was the latter.
Yi-Han immediately grasped his staff and looked at Sharakan. "...Sharakan?" Responding to his master's call, Sharakan came over but did not kneel. Nor did it charge at Yi-Han with a savage roar, aiming its bony fangs at his throat. Instead, Sharakan simply ignored him, as if it hadn't heard. When called again, it lay down with its head pressed to the ground. "???" His friends were perplexed, unable to comprehend why the bone summon was behaving this way.
Nillia, the hunter, was the first to catch on. That's... ‘Is it going through a rebellious phase?’ Even the loyal dogs and wolves raised by hunters went through periods of disobedience as they grew. It was a sign of a maturing spirit developing a sense of rebellion. ‘...But does an undead bone summon also have a rebellious phase?’ Nillia blinked in disbelief, finding it hard to believe.



Chapter 126
It was not important whether an undead summon had a rebellious spirit or not. The fact was that Sharakan was currently showing such defiance. "Sharakan, come here," Yi-Han commanded, his voice deepening, causing even the mouse to tremble in fear. He wondered, defying the principal like this, would this undead summon be destroyed?
However, Yi-Han, instead of smashing Sharakan, tried to coax and appease him. "Why are you doing this, Sharakan?" But Sharakan began to dig the ground as if he hadn't heard Yi-Han's words, leaving Yi-Han baffled. Until now, his summons had been obedient. Professor Mortum had mentioned it before – an undead summon does not always absolutely obey its master's commands. In fact, they are more likely to disobey. The stronger an undead summon becomes, the less likely it is to obey, partly due to the inherent opposition between the living and the dead. Sharakan, being a strong summon, was not acting out of character.
Thump-thump. Nillia pointed with her claw to the front pocket of Yi-Han's coat and then mimed throwing something to Sharakan. "Are you suggesting I tempt him with food?" Yi-Han asked. Nillia nodded her head. "Gainando?" Yi-Han inquired further. Nillia shook her head in panic.
Suddenly, Gainando, peeking out of the coat pocket, squeaked in shock and betrayal, looking at Nillia. 'Not that! The beer candy!'
“Ah, you mean the beer candy.” Yi-Han realized belatedly what Nillia meant. Since Gainando had gone back into the pocket, he had moved the beer candy to another pocket.
When Yi-Han finally took out the beer candy, Sharakan suddenly perked up. Yi-Han instinctively threw the beer candy in the opposite direction, and Sharakan, lying down, excitedly leaped into the air and gobbled up the candy. "Feeling better now?" Yi-Han asked. However, after eating the beer candy, Sharakan lay down again. The watching mouse, growing anxious, ran up to Sharakan and squeaked frantically, Chikchikchik!! It seemed to be pleading, 'You're really going to get yourself killed doing this,' but Sharakan turned its head away with a sulky expression.
Yi-Han and Nillia fell deep in thought. "Surely... he must want something," Yi-Han mused. Nillia meowed softly and nodded her head. Even a rebellious summon would show such behavior for a reason. It was clear the summon wanted something. Yi-Han joked, "Really want to eat Gainando... just kidding. Gainando." Filled with sorrow, Gainando tried to hide inside the coat, squeaking.
"You should have done your homework when I told you to, then this wouldn't have happened," Yi-Han remarked, somewhat unrelatedly. Yonaire admired Yi-Han's use of the Polymorph Forest as an opportunity to correct bad habits, thinking he'd make a great dormitory supervisor.
"Sharakan. Sharakan? You need to tell me what you want so I can help. If there's something you want, try to express it," Yi-Han urged. Sharakan, pretending not to hear, lay still before slowly turning its body. It then pointed at itself. Though complete, its body was just bones and gave off an unsightly and eerie vibe. Yi-Han asked in realization, "...Oh? Do you need a body too?" Sharakan wagged his tailbone excitedly, affirming Yi-Han's guess. Yi-Han was relieved to see the summon happy, but even more bewildered.
'What should I make its body out of?' Yi-Han pondered. Yonaire, skilled in alchemy, pointed to the mud beside the forest. It was soft and sticky, ideal for making golems or other summons. "How about that?" he suggested.
Sharakan approached the mud and rolled its body in it. As it did so, a flesh made of mud began to cover its bones. "Wow...!" Yi-Han and his friends marveled at the sight. Though the color was lackluster, it was certainly a more majestic form than just bones wandering around.
However, Sharakan seemed displeased with it. It glanced over its body for a moment and then began to vigorously shake off the mud. Yi-Han quickly conjured a water shield to block it. A speck of mud flew through and splattered on Gainando's face. Squeak, squeak, squeak! "Didn't like the mud, it seems," Yi-Han observed. The red fox looked downhearted. Yi-Han reassured her that it was alright. "At least we found a way. There's no real loss."
Gainando shook the mud off with his forepaws, sending a very displeased look. There is a loss!
The mice, growing anxious as the principal and the group did not leave the forest, interjected into the conversation. Squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak- "Follow you?" Yi-Han asked. The mouse nodded and guided Yi-Han and his friends to a spring they had passed earlier.
It was the water of the Cold Iron Water spring, known for creating spring slimes. The spring water, mixed with special magic, was likely to satisfy even the finicky undead familiar. Yi-Han, realizing the specialty of the spring water, looked at it with a mix of anticipation and hope. 'Maybe this will work.'
Splash! Sharakan jumped into the spring and emerged, forming its body from the water. The dark and blue hue of its watery flesh made Sharakan look more mystical. Yi-Han and his friends were even more amazed than before. This must be it... But Sharakan coldly shook off all the water. Once again, Gainando was hit in the face with water droplets. Squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak!
'Hmm. Seems like he's telling me to let it go.' Yi-Han, not understanding mouse speech, but could comprehend what Gainando was saying. "Sharakan, I'm sorry, but I can't create your flesh anymore." Yi-Han decided to use his last resort. Sharakan, just stay in that pond! It wasn't a bluff or a threat. What else could he do if Sharakan wouldn't listen? Yi-Han slowly turned away.
Then Sharakan groaned pitifully, scratching the ground desperately. It even tried to bite Yi-Han's staff. "No, Sharakan." But Sharakan did not give up and kept pointing at Yi-Han's staff, as if it wanted something from it. "...You want me to make it?" Sharakan wagged its tailbone excitedly. Although Yi-Han figured out what it wanted, he was still puzzled. 'I don't have the ability for that.' The elemental magic he could use was limited, and none suited to satisfy a demanding summon like Sharakan. The only possible element might be...?
"Alright, let's try." As Yi-Han raised his staff, Sharakan sat expectantly, watching him.
"Strike down, Ferkuntra's Thunderbolt!" Yi-Han commanded. As the fierce lightning tore through the air, Sharakan dodged in fright. Then, with a very angry expression, it furiously pounded the ground. "...Wasn't this it?" Yi-Han, who had expected Sharakan to want a body of lightning, was baffled by the reaction. Isn't lightning impressive?
Sharakan, grumbling, pointed at the spring water. 'Did it want water made?' Yi-Han thought, while preparing the &lt;Water Creation&gt; spell. He worried a bit; the guy didn't like the special water from the spring, would he be satisfied with the water Yi-Han conjured?
Contrary to his worries, as a mass of water appeared in the air, Sharakan joyfully embraced it. The water changed its form and transformed into Sharakan's body. "Are you alright?" Yi-Han asked. Sharakan, now shimmering like water, growled and pointed at the staff. "Do you want more?" Yi-Han inquired. Sharakan nodded vigorously. Yi-Han summoned more water. The summoned water flowed into Sharakan's body and continued without stopping...
Squeak, squeak? The forest mouse, observing the scene, was flustered. The massive amount of water being compressed into the undead summon's muscles was startling, but even more so was the principal's relentless summoning of more water. How immense must his mana be to allow such extravagance?
"It was indeed a strange experience," Yi-Han reflected.
“...”
“...”
Silence filled the air as Yi-Han and his friends, looking utterly drained, returned to the tower at midnight. Gainando seemed to be rubbing his face, as if he still felt mouse whiskers on it. 'We didn't reach the stable, only completed Sharakan.' Due to wandering too much in the Polymorph Forest, Yi-Han had no choice but to return after breaking through the forest. The lack of progress was disappointing, but with a test looming the next day, pushing further seemed unwise...
Growl! "What?" Sharakan lunged at Gainando. As the large, blue summon rushed at him, Gainando dodged in fright. "Why, why are you doing this?! Is it because I teased you with food!? I'll give it to you!" Yi-Han wondered, 'Did you tease it in the meantime?'
As Sharakan toppled Gainando and climbed on top of him, other students from the Blue Dragon Tower in the lounge looked on in fascination. "Is that the bone-made summon?" "How did it complete it?" "It looks much better than before. Want to try this?" His friends tossed food to Sharakan, who sat atop Gainando. Delighted, Sharakan snapped up the food and wagged its tail.
"Let... let me go..." Gainando pleaded. Growl! "Ah, no, you don’t have to let me go." As Sharakan showed anger, Gainando quickly backed down. However, Sharakan was not actually angry with Gainando.
Bark! Bark! "What?" When Sharakan barked towards the outside, Yi-Han instinctively grabbed his staff. Being in the lounge made no difference. In the magic academy, relaxing in the lounge could lead to masked students from other towers bursting in to steal flags. Click! The lounge door opened, and skeleton warriors, summoned from somewhere, suddenly appeared.
The students were shocked by the unexpected entrance. "Has the academy fallen?!" one exclaimed.
"That's impossible! Flash forth!" Yi-Han was the first to react. Swinging his staff, lightning flew, raising the hair on the students' heads and striking the skeleton warrior, turning it into dust. "Wake the sleeping ones! The principal is attacking us!" someone cried out. "Why... Why?!" another asked in confusion. "I don't know..." Yi-Han began to respond, then hesitated. Could it be that this was to prevent them from studying for tomorrow's test? Surprisingly, his instincts whispered that this might be the case.
"Anyway, everyone gather! Block the lounge door!" Yi-Han commanded. "Alright, got it!" the students responded. Yi-Han launched water beads in succession, pushing back the skeleton warriors. Meanwhile, other friends quickly started barricading the lounge door with sofas and chairs. Asan, checking the windows, cried out in alarm. "The undead are surrounding the tower with torches!" 'This is madness,' Yi-Han thought.
Bark! Bark! Yi-Han stroked Sharakan. If it weren't for Sharakan, he would have been attacked before he could even grab his staff. "Sharakan, wait and if anyone comes in, chase them out. Everyone, help with the barricade!" The princess, with her disheveled hair, swung her staff. Mud began to layer over the barricade, binding it firmly. Yonaire handed out the potions she had prepared to her friends. Gainando quickly cleared away any snacks that fell to the floor.
Thud, thud, thud - Other friends who had been sleeping came down, and the barricade in front of the lounge was finally completed, but the sounds from outside did not stop. The rhythmic knocking sent shivers down the students' spines. "What in the world...?" someone muttered. “Open the door, you ironheads…” a voice from outside demanded. Silence fell. The students of the Blue Dragon Tower, hearing the voice from outside, grimly piled up the barricade even higher.



Chapter 127
"Why... won't you open the door...? Why...?"
When the students offered no response, the voice grew more agitated.
The students of the Blue Dragon Tower retorted sharply, "Enough of this!"
"Why are you behaving like this?!"
“Such quick-witted rascals…”
The skull principal lamented in a distant voice, causing the students guarding the door to grit their teeth in frustration.
This is going too far!
The thought of what might have happened if they had opened the door trusting only the principal's status was too dreadful to imagine.
"If you want to give a test, just do it! Why are you causing such a disturbance?"
“What are you talking about?”
Though they confronted the skull principal, his response was unexpected.
What?
Was he trying to disrupt their study for the test?
“Is this a test?”
"..."
"..."
The students glared at the invisible skull principal outside the door.
Such absurdity!
"Indeed. After all, solving problems in a classroom isn't the only form of a test," mused Yi-Han, nodding as if he understood.
It made sense now why the skull principal had chosen such an annoying method if this itself was the test.
Of course, one could question what this had to do with the &lt;Basic Magic Character Education&gt; course, but that wasn't important.
After all, it was a lecture that sent them to an island full of traps...
"Wardanaz?! You shouldn't just accept it!"
"Don't be swayed by such nonsensical sophistry!"
"It's not that I’m swayed... Principal!"
Yi-Han called out to the skull principal.
“Ah, this irritating voice is Wardanaz. Why are you calling me?”
"Is it alright for you to do this when we have another test tomorrow?"
“Of course! Because my class is more important than those of other professors!”
'I made a mistake. He's crazier than I thought.'
Bringing up the names of other professors was a failed attempt. The skull principal was more insane than anticipated.
“But no need to worry too much!”
"?"
“Because the other dormitories are experiencing the same thing!”
"Oh...!"
"What do you mean 'Oh'! Is this the time to be happy?!"
Yet, despite their protests, some faces of the Blue Dragon Tower students brightened.
Wow! We're all in the same boat!
"I'll clear it up in the morning… if you make it to morning, that is."
The skull principal spoke as if bestowing a favor.
Enraged, Yonaire raised her fist, about to make a gesture, but Yi-Han shook his head, stopping her.
'We might be watched from outside.'
'Oops!'
Yi-Han rechecked the interior of the lounge.
The barricades, reinforced several times, were still sturdy.
'We can hold out for another hour or two.'
Yi-Han was far from complacent, even in the apparent safety.
Given the opponent's twisted intentions, it was unlikely that he would attack only from the front.
"Sharakan! Check the other directions, not just the main entrance of the lounge."
A deep sky-blue leopard growled softly and moved towards the other side of the tower.
Hardly had he spoken when Sharakan began tapping on the wall. A signal that undead were approaching.
"Staircase windows! The undead are climbing up towards the staircase windows!"
"Are you kidding me?!"
The students cursed at this news. As they hurried towards the windows, Yi-Han stopped them.
"No need to panic! It's not that situation yet. I'll give the instructions!"
In such critical situations, it was common for people to argue over who was right.
However, in the Blue Dragon Tower, such disagreements were non-existent.
When Yi-Han gave orders, everyone at the Blue Dragon Tower acted in unison.
"Yonaire, take two with you and cover the window side. Sharakan! Now that you've checked the window, look for other possible entries! Gainando, no need to guard the food storage now, head to the barricade!"
'I'll have to eliminate that guy first next time.'
The skull principal, surveying each dormitory from his workshop, licked his lips at the situation in the Blue Dragon Tower.
That boy from the Wardanaz family was exceptionally talented.
Normally, a flock led by a lion would triumph over a flock led by a sheep. But here, it was as if a dragon, not a lion, led them, leaving no room for vulnerabilities.
It was common for natural leaders among the freshmen to emerge, but this was excessive.
It seemed selfish, stealing all opportunities for his friends to grow through hardship!
“Let’s look at the other towers’ situation”, the skull principal shifted his long-distance magic vision to soothe his irritation.
As expected, the other towers were in utter chaos due to the surprise attack.
Skeleton warriors entered through the lounge doors, dragging out students...
The skull principal nodded in satisfaction. Then, he sent a voice message to the students of the Black Turtle Tower, barricaded behind the door.
“You ironheads... Open the door... I've come to help…”
Today, Yi-Han realized that the tower he resided in had more vulnerabilities than he thought.
Students screamed at the sight of skeleton warriors crawling through unexpected passages like windows near stairs and chimneys.
'A real lesson in practical education.'
Normally, the tower's magic should have repelled such intruders, but it was clear that the skull principal had personally breached the defenses.
Isn't that cheating?
Krrrrrrrr!
Nevertheless, the students of the Blue Dragon Tower were handling the situation relatively well.
Unlike other towers, they quickly counterattacked upon the surprise assault and then shut the door.
Thanks to the barricade at the main entrance of the lounge, even if a few creatures entered from other sides, the students had the leeway to manage them.
Moreover, Sharakan was pulling the weight of several people.
Crouching, it would bark and rush toward a direction, indicating the appearance of an undead.
"Flash forth!"
Yi-Han's lightning struck an undead climbing through a window, eliciting cheers from the Blue Dragon Tower students.
Though all the students had been learning magic gradually since their arrival, the magic displayed by the boy from the Wardanaz family was always on another level.
He continued to cast spells without showing any signs of fatigue.
And he was even controlling a separate summon!
Nebren of the Kirak family couldn't help but express his admiration.
Though loyal to the princess and convinced of her superiority, Nebren was always thrilled by Wardanaz's abilities.
The reputation of the empire's greatest family of mages was no empty title.
"Really amazing... Ah, sorry. Princess."
"?"
The princess raised her eyebrows in puzzlement as Nebren apologized.
"Well... it's true that Wardanaz is impressive, but I still believe you are more exceptional. Magic isn't all about the amount of power! Of course, Wardanaz is quite skilled in cooking and has a good reputation, but..."
As the conversation turned to cooking, the princess nodded.
Nebren, flustered, added, "I mean, if you were to cook, Princess, I'm sure you'd do even better..."
The princess shook her head.
"Really? Well, he does cook very well..."
"What are you two doing?!"
Gainando, struggling and grunting as he carried a chair, suddenly shouted out in exasperation.
Why are you lazing around!
"They're resting to recover their mana after using magic just now!"
"Rest while working! You may have depleted your mana, but you still have physical strength!"
"Gainando, watch out in front!"
"?"
Gainando, who was carrying the chair, suddenly realized that the noise from the lounge's main entrance was growing louder, and now included creaking sounds.
Bang!
The persistent pounding of the skeleton warriors, like water droplets breaking a rock, finally shattered the lounge's main door and split the barricade.
Skeleton warriors that sprung through the gap instantly seized Gainando.
"Aaaah!"
"Gainando!!!"
"Leave him be! Gainando is wrong!"
While his friends said so, Yi-Han drew his Morning Star sword and charged in.
The nearest three skeleton warriors were cleanly sliced and tumbled away. Yi-Han grabbed Gainando's ankle, which was being dragged away, and pulled him back forcefully.
Although a few tufts of hair were pulled out, Gainando was safely rescued. The prince, his face pale with shock, exclaimed.
"These insane undead creatures! Isn't the principal going too far?"
"Why are you surprised now?"
"Gainando, fall back, and everyone, be careful at the entrance! Don't approach!"
Yi-Han warned his friends and then swung his sword.
The skeleton warriors attempting to enter through the gap seemed to sense the mana-absorbing aura from the Morning Star and dared not enter.
Rattle rattle rattle!
The skeleton warriors outside the barricade made a noisy ruckus.
Asan asked in a bewildered voice.
"Why are they suddenly acting like that?"
"Maybe they're angry because the mage is swinging a mana-absorbing sword?"
"…!"
Yonaire's offhand response seemed quite plausible.
The skeleton warriors began to pound again, widening the gap in the barricade to rush in all at once.
But this time, Yi-Han did not leave it unattended.
"Space, be perceived!"
Casting &lt;Spatial Perception&gt; spell once again, Yi-Han started hurling water orbs towards the skeletons outside the barricade.
The viciously flying water beads broke through the gap in the barricade, smashing the old bones of the skeleton warriors.
'I've stopped them!'
Just as Yi-Han was certain of this, a new group emerged from the darkness of the night in the distance.
"Could it be?"
"No, it's not undead! It's..."
Help us!
The newcomers were students from the Immortal Phoenix.
Seeing skeleton warriors swarming and chasing behind the students, it was clear what the situation was.
'They must have escaped after their lounge was breached!'
"What... what do we do?"
"Wardanaz. It might be dangerous to accept them. Considering the undead following them, there's a 90% chance..."
"Let's accept them."
"!"
"!!!"
His friends, who were arguing against it, suddenly felt ashamed at Yi-Han's immediate and decisive response.
To show such fear of the undead was one thing, but to exhibit this kind of attitude was another.
"Wardanaz... I misspoke. I've tarnished the name of my family and dishonored it. I'm sorry!"
"I'll go out and bring them in too! Wardanaz! Let's go together!"
"???"
Yi-Han was taken aback by his friends who suddenly began to reflect on their own accord.
'What are these guys talking about?'
Yi-Han's reason for agreeing to help was singular.
Who else but the skull principal could have sent those students here?
And considering the nature of the skull principal, not accepting those students would have likely led to him accusing them of undermining the essence of the &lt;Basic Magic Character Education&gt; class.
Even minor faults must be guarded against!
"Then... thank you all for agreeing. It's a relief that you came to this decision on your own."
Yi-Han nodded, grateful there was no need for persuasion.
“The ironheads of the Immortal Phoenix have escaped and run away?”
The skull principal, who was resting, reopened his vision upon receiving reports from his summoned creatures.
Indeed, the Immortal Phoenix students were frantically piercing through the darkness of the night, fleeing.
Under normal circumstances, this would have been a moment for mirthful laughter, but...
'They're running to the Blue Dragon Tower?'
What luck, of all places, they're heading to the one that's defending itself the best right now.
The skull principal grumbled and sent out a fervent wish.
'Don't accept them, don't accept them, don't accept them...'
However, Yi-Han, crushing the skull principal's expectations, dashed out with his friends through the barricade to rescue the students of the Immortal Phoenix.
The skull principal, bursting with indignation, exclaimed,
“Such a selfish brat! Such a selfish brat!!”
The other summoned creatures in the workshop, sensing the mood of the skull principal, bowed their heads.



Chapter 128
The summoned creatures did not particularly perceive the young Wardanaz as selfish. However, they knew all too well that voicing such an opinion when their master was in a foul mood could result in a hundred years of menial tasks, waiting for an intruder who would never come, in the 17th basement floor of the magic academy's main building.
Reluctantly, the summons could only express agreement.
"Indeed, he is selfish."
"He has stolen the learning opportunity from other students, Master."
"Such a wicked boy."
Despite their flattery, the skull principal's anger seemed unabated. He grumbled, puzzled by the boy's actions, for he had not taught him to be this way. The Principal noticed a striking resemblance between the young Wardanaz and his own younger self – clever, gutsy, and adept at concealing his true intentions to get what he wanted. Yet, why was he helping students from other towers? It was a habit the Principal found utterly incomprehensible.
While the skull principal was busy making unflattering comparisons, Yi-Han, the young mage, was fully focused. Battling the undead in the dark depths was an experience he questioned the necessity of for a freshman at the magic academy. He wasn't an adventurer or mercenary, after all.
"Light!"
However, the students on the scene had no time for such contemplations. As the light from other students' magic began to fade, Yi-Han swiftly cast his own light spell. Asan, alarmed, cried out.
"Wardanaz, it's dangerous..."
Despite Yi-Han's considerable mana, continuously casting spells from the dormitory to the current water beads had its limits.
"Light, light, light! Heat, distort the air! What's the matter, Asan?"
"...Nothing!"
Asan thought highly of his friend, even as he swung his staff. Yi-Han's spell created heat-laden illusions, conjuring mirage-like doubles around them. The skeleton warriors were baffled, unable to distinguish the real from the illusion.
"This way!"
The Immortal Phoenix students felt a thrill at the sight of Yi-Han, glowing in the darkness, reminiscent of a saint.
"Mr. Wardanaz!"
"Run!"
"Mr. Wardanaz...!"
"Run, I said!"
"Mr. Wardanaz is truly..."
Thwack!
Yi-Han struck a priest's back with his staff.
"Run, you fool! Do you want to get hit?"
"Sorry, sorry!"
A priest student, mesmerized by the halo in the darkness, regained his senses only after being struck.
He's not a saint, he's Wardanaz!
"Run inside! To the barricade!"
Yi-Han used the remaining water beads to topple the pursuing skeleton warriors.
'This will work!'
Seeing the disarray among the undead, Yi-Han felt confident they could evacuate the priests safely. But then, Asan stumbled.
"Ugh...!"
"!"
Yi-Han, sensing the magic disturbance, realized what had happened.
'A curse spell!'
Asan struggled, his left leg paralyzed.
"Cramps... cramps..."
"Wardanaz, what do we do?!"
"I'll take Asan. Go inside!"
Yi-Han lifted Asan onto his shoulder. Despite the pain and the paralysis curse, Asan was moved to tears.
"Wardanaz...!"
In such a situation, finding a friend who would not abandon but care for him was rare. Wardanaz was indeed a noble friend.
Whoosh!
Another curse spell flew towards them. Yi-Han quickly positioned Asan in front to shield himself.
"Cough! Wardanaz! Ha ha ha!"
Asan knew all too well that carrying him, Yi-Han wouldn't be able to react swiftly. But the moment he became a shield and took the tickling curse, he couldn't help but laugh uncontrollably.
"Why you... ha ha ha ha!"
"Sorry, Asan."
Thanks to Asan's sacrifice, Yi-Han could spot the enemy. Amidst the skeleton warriors, there was one holding a bone staff, emitting a denser aura of dark magic typical of the undead. Hiding in the darkness among the skeletons, it had thought itself invisible, but to Yi-Han, it was clear as day. Using the curse twice was like shouting to be caught.
"Flash forth!"
Yi-Han's spell erupted, and a bolt of lightning shot toward the skeleton sorcerer. The sorcerer, taken aback, creaked in alarm, but fortunately, other warriors were there to protect it.
Bang!
The skeleton warriors, sensing danger, shielded the sorcerer with their bodies, blocking the attack with their bones.
'Damn.'
It was difficult to target a sorcerer protected by warriors, a lesson Yi-Han was learning the hard way.
Rattle!
This time, the skeleton warriors rushed at Yi-Han. Not to bring him down, but to prevent him from dodging while their sorcerer cast another spell.
Swoosh!
Just like before, a curse spell exploded towards Yi-Han along with a wave of magic.
The skeleton warriors, thinking Yi-Han would fall, were pleased.
Thump!
"These annoying creatures..."
-?!
However, instead of collapsing paralyzed, Yi-Han energetically finished off the skeleton warriors. Surprisingly, the direct curse had no effect on him. His overwhelming mana rendered him immune to such mundane curses.
"Magic Missile!"
"Burn!"
"Wardanaz! We've come to help!"
The skeleton sorcerer wasn't the only one with friends. The exhausted students of the Immortal Phoenix had entered the barricade, creating a chance for other friends to rush out and aid Yi-Han.
Fist-sized spheres of mana shot out, and flames erupted over the skeletons. Among them, one Immortal Phoenix student stood out in Yi-Han's eyes, fighting admirably.
"Fire, shoot forth!"
The student's skill with the 2nd Circle spell &lt;Flame Shot&gt; clearly indicated a talent for fire magic.
'A fire spirit mixed-blood?'
Perhaps a descendant of someone who had made a pact with a fire spirit, the Immortal Phoenix priest's hair and eyes flickered with small flames.
"Already mastering 2nd Circle fire magic..."
"Ha ha ha! Good shot. Ha ha ha!"
"I'm envious."
"????"
Still laughing from the curse, Asan was puzzled by Yi-Han's words.
'Why would you, Wardanaz, envy that?'
It was incomprehensible to Asan that Yi-Han, who used much more powerful spells, would envy a simple fire spell.
"Mr. Wardanaz. Thank you. Thanks to you, all our companions could enter."
"I should be thanking you. With your help, we took down the sorcerer."
Yi-Han reached out to shake hands with the priest. Before the priest could withdraw his hand, Yi-Han had already grasped it.
"…!"
It was only then that Yi-Han realized the hand he was holding was ablaze.
'Dangerous... but it seems not.'
Startled at first, Yi-Han breathed a sigh of relief.
Fortunately, the flame did not harm his hand.
"It seems to be just a harmless flame on the surface."
"...Oh, no but..."
"?!"
Yi-Han hastily withdrew his hand, only then feeling a bit of heat.
'What's this?'
The other's flame wasn't safe after all. Yi-Han had been unconsciously expelling mana from his palm to resist the flame.
Had he not instinctively protected himself as he had when he embraced a burning puppy and rolled around, the outcome might have been different...
"Are you sure you're alright? If you're hurt..."
"Ah, I'm fine. Sorry for acting rashly."
"There's nothing to be sorry about."
The priest introduced himself.
He was Nigisor, a priest of the Aphar Order, A flame-worshipping order, just as Yi-Han had suspected, a priest with blood mixed from an ancestor's pact with a fire spirit.
"Thanks again for your help. If you ever need assistance, just say the word."
Yi-Han highly regarded the departing figure of the priest. In a world where there were many ungrateful people, even after receiving help, Nigisor's politeness was exceptional.
'A good person indeed.'
"Are you talking about Nisigor?"
"He seemed like a good person."
Yi-Han, who met priestess Tijiling inside the barricade, told her the story of Nigisor. His help with the flame magic and not forgetting the favor...
Could it be that all priests are such good people?
"It might be best to keep your distance from him..."
"?!"
Yi-Han was startled by Tijiling's response. Tijiling was known as one of the kindest priestesses in the Immortal Phoenix.
Such a priestess speaking like this was surprising.
"Did Priest Nigisor cause any trouble in the tower?"
"No, not that..."
Priestess Siana, distributing recovery potions to the weary, approached Yi-Han with delight.
"Mr. Yi-Han of the Wardanaz family, a discerning and understanding alchemist!"
"Priestess Siana of the Flameng Order, a shining talent in alchemy! Your skills always amaze me."
"..."
Tijiling looked on in disbelief at their mutual compliments, as extravagant as those at an imperial social gathering.
Curious, Yi-Han asked.
"By the way, Priestess Siana, did Nigisor ever cause any trouble in the tower?"
"No such incident."
"I see. I received Nigisor's help earlier, he fought well and seemed reliable."
"Yes, but it might be best to keep your distance."
"?!"
Both responding this way, Yi-Han was perplexed.
'Tijiling probably won't speak ill of others.'
Yi-Han decided to probe Siana for more information.
"The most skilled alchemist Sia..."
"Undead are fleeing!!!"
"The dawn is breaking! The dawn is breaking!"
Far away, with the break of dawn, skeleton warriors were seen fleeing beyond the barricade.
Students from all towers felt a sudden emotional surge.
"...Everyone fought bravely."
"You too!"
Students hugged, shook hands, and praised each other everywhere.
They had fought as comrades in this ruthless magic academy.
Overwhelmed with emotion, Gainando burst out of the barricade, eager to shout his feelings.
“We've won...”
“Wait a moment.”
“?!”
Yi-Han grabbed the back of Gainando's neck.
“Sharakan. Go ahead and leave first.”
Sharakan barked once and then dashed out beyond the barricade.
Upon this, the skeleton warriors who were hiding right up against the barricade, cursing, fled in terror.
“...”
“...”
The students trembled at the sight.
To have dug such a trap until the very end.
How utterly filthy and despicable!
“That’s utterly filthy and despicable.”
The skull principal muttered with a sneer.
That guy was incredibly sly to an astonishing degree.
Next time, he would have to set a trap separately...
The sun was rising unkindly.
The skull principal sighed and delivered his verdict.
“Perfect score.”
“Thank you.”
Yi-Han bowed deeply as the representative at the front. Then, he thought to himself.
‘Indeed, helping the students of the Immortal Phoenix made a big difference.’
‘I can't understand why that guy would help the others as well, not just secure a perfect score for himself. Is he trying to provoke me on purpose? Such audacity...’
The teacher and the student ended the test warmly.
Each with their own thoughts!



Chapter 129
As the skull principal vanished into the dawn, the students let out a sigh of relief.
"Just a moment. Isn't he just pretending to disappear and hiding nearby with an invisibility spell?"
"He could be hiding close by! Let's throw a stone, just in case!"
'Looks like the magic academy is ruining the empire's talents.'
Yi-Han looked at his friends who were beginning to fall into conspiracy theories with pity.
"It's a shame about the Immortal Phoenix. There were students caught..."
The students of the Blue Dragon had not been caught and had therefore scored perfectly, but it was not the case for Immortal Phoenix.
Several priests were caught while escaping, which inevitably led to a loss of points.
"The teachings are what's important, not the scores."
Priestess Tijiling said with a devout attitude. Yi-Han was astonished at this.
'Aren't the scores important?'
After all, it's the scores that remain on record.
And the value of teachings depends on the teachings themselves. What value could there be in lessons like these?
'Teachings like "Don't associate with a lich," "Don't trust people blindly," or "Beware of the undead at night" are all that's left.'
"Hmm... Yes, teachings are important."
Yi-Han's response came out strangely late, which puzzled Tijiling.
Why is he responding so late?
"By the way, priests from the empire will be visiting the academy this weekend."
"!"
Yi-Han's face brightened.
When the empire's priests visited the academy, it wasn't just about sharing food and drinks.
Most importantly, it meant a reduction in the challenging teachings of the skull principal.
'The conscience of the empire is improving the academy!'
'Maybe this weekend will be more relaxing.'
Additionally, Yi-Han, who had decided to join as many orders as he could, not just the Presinga Order, was thinking of looking for a new order during their visit.
Considering this...
'Why doesn't the Wardanaz family provide the same support as other noble families?'
Yi-Han grumbled internally.
Look at the Maykin family!
They actively support the Flameng Order, ensuring benefits for their lineage.
Can't they support without belief?
'Complaining is pointless. I'll make my own path.'
Even if his family didn't help, Yi-Han would follow his own path.
Yi-Han looked at Priestess Tijiling.
Intimidated by his charismatic gaze, Tijiling became slightly tense.
"Do you have something to say...?"
"Priestess Tijiling. You seem to have lost weight since I last saw you."
"..."
That's not true?
"It hasn't even been a day; it's impossible for me to have lost weight..."
"You should eat something more now that you’re at the Blue Dragon Tower."
"..."
Thanks to Yi-Han, who would periodically call Tijiling to 'have some tea with meat broth in a pot,' Tijiling had no nutritional problems.
And even if she didn't eat well, it was impossible for someone to lose weight in less than a day.
"Come on. Let's go sit down."
"It's a sin for a priest serving Presinga to indulge in luxurious meals..."
"I see. But if you don't eat, I'll make Gainando fast with you."
"?!"
Gainando, who was clearing the barricade nearby, looked at Yi-Han in shock.
Why am I involved?!
"Priestess...! I get hungry if I miss even a single meal...!"
"..."
Tijiling had no choice but to sit down obediently. Yi-Han nodded with a cold expression, like the skull principal.
"We should get the other priests to sit down as well."
"But the priests here mostly live austerely, so they would consider such a meal sinful," Priestess Tijiling said with a slightly sullen voice.
"Are you saying this because of how I threatened Gainando, Priestess Tijiling?"
"No, that's not it."
Though she denied it, it didn't quite seem true. Gainando, looking puzzled, said, "But our meal is actually quite modest...."
"..."
"..."
Passing students of the Blue Dragon looked at Gainando as if he were mad.
Has this guy already forgotten what a truly modest meal is?
"Everyone might indeed find such a meal burdensome," Yi-Han nodded.
Of course, Yi-Han wasn't doing this because he had surplus ingredients.
Relations with the White Tiger students were beyond repair.
Though relations with the Black Tortoise students were relatively harmonious, misunderstandings about Yi-Han due to baseless rumors spread by the White Tiger students occasionally arose.
But not so with the wise and kind priests of the Immortal Phoenix.
They would not fall for such rumors and would trust Yi-Han.
And more importantly, being treated to a generous meal would surely inspire them to speak well of him to the visiting priests over the weekend.
Whether the Immortal Phoenix students liked it or not, they had to eat. Yi-Han's eyes shone with a ruthless determination.
"Gainando, follow me. You need to help persuade them."
"??"
"..."
Gainando, not understanding why Yi-Han called him, was confused, but Priestess Tijiling realized and was shocked.
Yi-Han brought out the food stored in the pantry.
Buttered, warmed white bread with honey and sweet tree sap for dipping was placed on the table. Pork and beef, either whole roasted, salt-cured, or smoked, were also laid out. Canned fish, thinly sliced, was served on plates.
He also took out a jar of fresh milk 'borrowed' from Professor Uregor's cabin.
He spooned various fruit jams from glass jars into the cold milk, stirring vigorously to make a rare sweet beverage hard to find at the academy.
"You had all this?!"
"Don't ask for me to do this often, because then you won't get it."
'How did he know?!'
Yi-Han smacked the back of Gainando's hand as he reached to grab a piece first, then checked on the soup.
The aroma of the boiling rich broth made the students of the Blue Dragon happy.
"Sharakan."
Yi-Han tossed a piece of meat to Sharakan. Gainando looked on enviously, then averted his eyes when Sharakan growled threateningly at him.
"Almost done. Tell everyone to sit down."
Yi-Han skillfully used the juice from the cooked meat. He stir-fried the vegetables he was growing himself and made a sauce by mixing in flour.
'Not bad.'
Yi-Han tasted it and was impressed with his own talent. Utilizing the meat juice so well...
This would certainly go well with the fresh vegetables from the garden...
'...I should stop thinking about it.'
Strangely, while his magic skills didn't seem to improve quickly, his cooking skills were rapidly advancing.
Yonaire, helping with the preparations, was puzzled by the carrot cupcakes and sweet pumpkin cookies being baked.
"Where did these come from?"
"I made them with produce from the garden."
"..."
"...This isn't particularly professional or difficult cooking. Yonaire. It's easier than you think."
'I didn't say anything...'
Suddenly, Yonaire was taken aback by Yi-Han's defensive demeanor.
"You understand, right?"
"Yes, uh, yes."
Not quite grasping what she was agreeing to, Yonaire nodded, overwhelmed by Yi-Han's forcefulness.
For some reason, it seemed that Yi-Han wanted to assert that he wasn't serious about cooking.
...To Yonaire, however, it seemed quite the opposite…
Though they sat down under duress, the young priests who had fought through the night were moved by the warm meal.
Seeing a student stuff his cheeks full of food, Yi-Han felt a sense of pride.
'No, it's Gainando.'
Upon closer inspection, it was not a student from the Immortal Phoenix, but Gainando.
Fortunately, the Immortal Phoenix students were also enjoying their meal.
The clatter of plates and bowls was the only sound in the air.
"Thank you so much, Mr. Yi-Han of the Wardanaz family."
"I only did what was needed."
Internally, Yi-Han hoped they would speak well of him to the visiting priests over the weekend, but he did not show it.
Instead, he nodded with the dignity befitting a noble. The young priests were deeply impressed by his demeanor.
"The priests of the order will be visiting the academy this weekend, and I would like to tell them about what Mr. Yi-Han of the Wardanaz family has done."
"Well, I won't stop you if you do."
"But..."
"?"
As the other hesitated, Yi-Han was puzzled.
Why?
'Could it be that the Wardanaz family is blacklisted?'
Given what the head of the family had said about the empire's Religious Orders, it wouldn't be surprising if they disliked the Wardanaz family.
"Then the priest might want to personally thank Mr. Yi-Han of the Wardanaz family... but I was worried you might be too busy. It's the weekend, after all..."
"I'm not busy at all. In fact, I often have too much free time on the weekends."
"Is, is that so?"
The young priests of the Immortal Phoenix were taken aback by Yi-Han's words.
To them, he seemed extremely busy...
Yet, the sincerity in his face made it seem like he wasn't joking or lying.
'Maybe?'
'He must really be that free.'
"Dark magic?"
At Professor Garcia's question, Yi-Han raised his hand.
"Summoning magic?"
He raised his hand again for the next question.
"Illusion magic?"
Again, Yi-Han raised his hand.
He then caught the eyes of the Immortal Phoenix students sitting nearby.
"...I'm not busy at all. Understand?"
"Bu... but you seem so busy."
"Yi-Han... you are busy... you need to cut back."
Not only the Immortal Phoenix students, but also his friends from the Blue Dragon were astounded.
Before the test, Professor Garcia had divided the students according to their interests.
And Yi-Han had entered every category.
It clearly seemed too much.
'Isn't he going to collapse at this rate?'
"From my point of view, you're being too harsh on yourself, Wardanaz."
"Even I think it's a bit much..."
Students from the Black Tortoise and White Tiger joined in the concern.
However, Yi-Han remained unfazed.
"I still have room to spare."
"Yi-Han, you really need to cut back..."
Professor Garcia approached, speaking with a worried tone.
Like the old saying that the most beautiful singing bird dies the fastest, a genius with exceptional talent must be wary of being consumed by it.
"I'm giving this advice based on personal experience, Yi-Han. Exploring every field of magic is a natural destiny for an ambitious young mage with talent and aspiration, but..."
'Every word in that sentence seems to oppose me.'
"It's really hard."
"Did you, Professor, also learn various types of magic at the same time like Yi-Han?"
"I did, once."
"Then maybe Yi-Han can do it too?"
"Uh... well, yes, but..."
Professor Garcia found herself at a loss for words at Gainando's pointed remark.
Oh?
Is that so?
Reflecting on his own arduous journey, he had thought he should dissuade the student from walking the same path...
But then, he wondered if he had the right to do so.
Especially for a naturally talented mage like Yi-Han.
"Um... still, back in my time, there wasn't someone like Professor Bagrak... No, never mind, it's nothing."
Professor Garcia hastily stopped herself, not wanting to speak ill of another professor in front of the students.
However, Yi-Han instantly understood what Professor Garcia was about to say.
"Well, Yi-Han might be better off than I was. Yes, I won't say anymore."
With a gesture as if to encourage, Professor Garcia clenched her fist, shook it, and then walked away.
Yi-Han watched her go, feeling an inexplicable sense of unease, as if he had just missed a final opportunity.

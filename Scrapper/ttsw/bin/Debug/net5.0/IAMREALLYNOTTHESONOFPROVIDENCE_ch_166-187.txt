Shen Tian was thinking of what excuse to use to reject Zhao Hao when someone appeared. He looked at Zhao Hao and said, “Nine-Yang Battle Constitution?”
The Sacred Leader was well-read in all kinds of ancient books and was very knowledgeable. He had read about the Nine-Yang Battle Constitution in one of the ancient books. It was said to have the same principle as the Huge Sun Saint Constitution. It was just one of its variations.
Although it was not as powerful as the Huge Sun Saint Constitution, it was strong enough to overpower most of the world’s spirit constitutions. Even Fang Chang’s Fire and Earth Dual Lightning Spirit Constitution was no match to it!
If the sacred ground could recruit him, his presence would be invaluable. He could eventually become one of the sacred ground’s strongest protectors!
Thus, the Sacred Leader asked slowly, “Tian’er, who is this?”
Shen Tian had no choice but to explain, “This is Zhao Hao. I met him in Fog City the other day.”
Zhao Hao added, “I wish to have a chance to repay Brother Shen’s kindness!”
Shen Tian’s luck stunned the Sacred Leader. Not only had he managed to obtain a Spirit Stone Vein and two precious items, but he had also unearthed a genius follower with the Nine-Yang Battle Constitution!
According to Zhao Hao, Shen Tian had given him a few instructions, and he recovered his cultivation miraculously!
It was like Shen Tian was the Son of the Heavenly Dao itself!
Tian’er must be a blessing to our sacred ground!
The Sacred Leader replied, “Sure! Zhao Hao, you are fated with the sacred ground. You can join us. Are you willing to be my disciple, becoming my fifth true disciple?”
The Sacred Leader’s proposal astonished Zhao Hao. He hesitated for a moment. In the cultivation world, a master was like a father to cultivators. He could not have another master without the previous one’s permission.
Zhao Hao was Sword Venerable Qian Yang’s disciple, so he found it morally wrong to acknowledge a new master now.
But it’s such a good opportunity…
Then, a weak voice sounded in Zhao Hao’s mind. “Accept the offer.”
It was Sword Venerable Qian Yang.
The Sacred Leader observed Zhao Hao before he calmly transmitted to the Sword Venerable, “Friend, there’s barely anything left of your soul. If you want, you can use the Soul Palace in the sacred ground to regain your power. When you are ready, you can become a ghost cultivator or find another suitable body.”
The two of them communicated through their spiritual power and came to some kind of agreement. Finally, they had a deal.
Zhao Hao was sold… Cough, cough, sent to the sacred ground by his master. The Divine Firmament’s Sacred Leader would be his new master, and he would cultivate lightning arts.
Zhao Hao was looking forward to being in the same sect as Shen Tian. He finally had the chance to repay Shen Tian for what he had done.
Zhao Hao was excited and showed off in front of Xue Wuxia.
Hahaha, the tide is turned, and I’ve finally beaten you! Now, I’m in the same sect as Master Celestial, and he is my Senior Brother! What about you?
Indeed, Xue Wuxia was very jealous of him. Nonetheless, she was not the only one. Azure Lotus’ green monster became uglier too. His jealousy sprang from the fact that the Sacred Leader had accepted yet another genius as his disciple.
I’m starting to think that I’m a fake elder in Divine Firmament…
How I wish I could have so many disciples with a bright future!
When he is old and fails his Tribulation Transcendence, they will be there to take care of him. Unlike me, I have nothing! There’s no other way than Immortal Ascension!
Zhao Hao bowed to the Divine Firmament’s Sacred Leader and followed behind Shen Tian.
The Hidden Fog Country’s king walked up to Shen Tian and asked if he was willing to have a golden statue built in his honor.
Naturally, Shen Tian wanted to reject the idea.
I’m just a Foundation Establishment cultivator! What if my providence is too low to have such honor and backfire?
Just as Shen Tian about to reject the proposal, the Sacred Leader spoke. “Tian’er, accept that. According to ancient books, it would be beneficial to you when tons of people make offerings in your name.”
The Sacred Leader believed that Shen Tian was the Son of Providence, so it was alright for them to build a golden statue for him.
Shen Tian had no choice. “Alright, but make sure the statue includes the mask as well. Try to be as low-profile as possible.”
Shen Tian took out his Phoenix Feather Mask and showed it to the king.
“Alright, Master Celestial. I’ll ask the best sculptor to do it.”
Well, I will definitely give emphasis to Master Celestial’s essence! The Phoenix Feather Mask looks so good on Master Celestial! It gives prominence to his transcendent self!
The Hidden Fog Country’s king was willing to build hundreds of statues of Shen Tian after knowing the relationship between him and the Sacred Leader.
Gold was not precious in the world of cultivation. It would be more valuable to be favored by the sacred ground. As long as he had the chance to flatter Master Celestial, money was not something to worry about!
…
When everything was settled, the Sacred Leader Token vibrated again.
Zhang Yunting’s voice sounded. “Father! Father! This is Yunting. Can you hear me?”
The Sacred Leader replied, “Yes? Are you at Junior Sister White Lotus’s place?”
Zhang Yunting said, “We are there already. But Aunt-Master White Lotus says that Senior Brother’s injury is too serious. She tried her best and could only prevent the wounds from getting worse. There’s nothing much she could do. When can you guys be back? Senior Brother is vomiting blood now. He is in great pain. What do I do?”
The Sacred Leader replied, “Relax! Do not panic. I’m on the way back. I’ll reach White Lotus Mountain soon. Do not panic!”
The Divine Firmament’s Sacred Leader kept the token and looked at the king.
“I’ll take my leave now. You guys continue to discuss the details on Tian’er’s golden statue.”
The king promised to provide the best resources he had.
The Sacred Leader used his mystic art again and brought the others back to the sacred ground. He planted the Spirit Stone Vein down at the Saint Mountain and left.
Although he had abandoned his feelings, he was still worried about Fang Chang.
…
Many true disciples were around the White Lotus Mountain.
Fang Chang was very arrogant in the sacred ground and did not have a good relationship with others. However, suffering a Qi Deviation while trying to reach the Golden Core Ninth Refinement Stage was a shocking piece of news, and everyone wanted to know the latest information.
Shen Tian sat on the Saint Mountain’s Enlightenment Stone, moody. He was holding a chrysanthemum and counting its petals.
“My fault, not my fault, my fault, not my fault…”
Shen Tian was only thinking about one thing now.
Am I the one to blame for Fang Chang’s Qi Deviation? Is it because I took away his fortuitous opportunity?
Oh, I feel so bad for him!



                            SIGN IN
                        

It was reasonable for Shen Tian to have such thoughts.
Technically, Shen Tian had only snatched others’ fortuitous opportunities twice after he had transmigrated.
Once was when he had obtained the Demon Book of Hyuga before Qin Gao. That had resulted in Qin Gao receiving a harsh beating.
The second time was now that he had obtained the Divine Devouring Vine’s silver liquid, which was supposed to be Fang Chang’s fortuitous opportunity.
As a result, Fang Chang had suffered a Qi Deviation immediately. His Golden Core was now broken, and he was on the verge of death now.
He had snatched the fortuitous opportunities twice, and both times the original owners had suffered almost immediately.
It was just too much of a coincidence!
Although the 13th Prince had been well-educated, the books he had read were just common ones. Shen Tian had no understanding of the silver liquids.
He planned to secretly bring the liquid to Fang Chang’s room, and from there, he would share the providence with him. However, Fang Chang was in the White Lotus Mountain’s ‘ICU ward’ now.
The Sacred Leader, Heavenly Venerable Azure Lotus, and White Lotus tried their best to save Fang Chang. However, there was no good news at all.
Thus, Shen Tian was really concerned about this matter.
Of course, Shen Tian was worried because Fang Chang was his Senior Brother, not because he was afraid of losing someone whose providence he could freeload.
Well, I should go to White Lotus Mountain and check on him. He is my Senior Brother, after all.
Worse comes to worst, I need to see my Senior Brother for the last time before he dies!
Shen Tian sighed and used his flying sword.
A huge crowd surrounded the White Lotus Mountain, but they were not allowed to enter. Only the true disciples had the eligibility to enter, and there were very few of them.
Li Yunfeng, Qin Yundi, Zhang Yunxi, and Zhang Yunting were present, together with Zhao Hao.
Zhao Hao was here not because he was worried about Fang Chang. He just felt that being here allowed him to integrate into the group faster.
Shen Tian landed and asked, “How’s Senior Brother Fang Chang? Update me.”
Li Yunfeng’s face was filled with sorrow. “Senior Brother, you are finally here. Poor Fang Chang, what a tragedy…”
Shen Tian decided to ignore Li Yunfeng. He had no time to listen to whatever he was trying to say. He looked at Qin Yundi and asked, “Yundi, you are an honest man. Tell me, what’s the situation now.”
Li Yunfeng was stunned for a moment, feeling insulted and threatened.
He would seek revenge if someone else treated him in that manner. Unfortunately, Shen Tian had beaten First Senior Brother before, so Li Yunfeng did not want to mess with him. He had an ominous feeling that the outcome would be a nasty one if he tried to pick up a fight.
Qin Yundi quickly answered, “The Sacred Leader and Martial Uncle Azure Lotus have been inside for two hours. Nothing happened in these two hours. I think First Senior Brother is not healed yet.”
Zhang Yunting added, “Sigh… First Senior Brother is too stubborn! He is too proud and refused to cultivate the forbidden sutra we gave him. Instead, he tried to forcefully refine his Golden Core. As a result, he suffered a Qi Deviation and broke his Golden Core.”
He genuinely worried about Fang Chang as they were like true brothers.
Shen Tian felt helpless too. Although he had suffered plenty of Qi Deviations before, those brought minor injuries. What Fang Chang suffered was way worse.
Cultivating to the Qi Refinement stage was not a big deal at all. It was the most basic step. One could consider themselves as real cultivators when their Dharmic foundation formed their Golden Core, and Divine Emblems started to appear on it. Thus, the Golden Core was no different than a cultivator’s heart.
Fang Chang was in a perilous situation now since his Golden Core had broken.
Shen Tian wanted to help, but he had no idea what he could do.
At that moment, a ray of light enveloped the White Lotus Mountain. It was a golden Buddhist light, and its radiance lit half of the sky. At the same time, 800 Arhats and other guardians stepped out of the ray of light.
Sanskrit sounds suddenly reverberated the place as if Buddha was chanting sutras to redeem the world. Then, the wooden fish released rhythmic sounds, and a monk in a white robe appeared out of nowhere.
He was sitting cross-legged, with a giant Bodhi Divine Tree avatar behind him.
When the wind blew, all the leaves started moving, and it radiated more light.
When the monk appeared, it seemed like the entire world was rid of all troubles.
The young monk was too outstanding, and everyone was looking at him.
Zhang Yunxi said to Shen Tian, “This is First Senior Brother’s friend, Bodhisattva Kuduo. He’s the Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground’s Bodhisattva, the strongest one in this generation.
“Sonic Thunder’s Sacred Leader has personally taught him the Great Sonic Sutra and the Great Wisdom Bodhi Wonderful Sutra. These are the best arts they have.
“However, Bodhisattva Kuduo does not like sitting down and reading books. He is more of a hands-on type of person.
“His Mighty Dragon Demon Subjugation technique is extremely powerful. He’s ranked 2nd on the Golden Core List, surpassing our First Senior Brother.”
Zhang Yunxi’s introduction was short but provided critical information to Shen Tian.
Shen Tian concluded that this Bodhisattva was an extraordinary individual. One had to know that millions of Golden Core cultivators resided in the Eastern Wilderness. Thus, the Bodhisattva was really amazing to rank second among so many Golden Core cultivators.
Shen Tian asked quietly, “Senior Sister, why does it seem his cultivation technique is different? Why does he have an avatar as well?”
Zhang Yunxi looked at Bodhisattva Kuduo and said, “Well, you will find out soon.”
Bodhisattva Kuduo sat down in mid-air and slowly floated onto the top of the mountain.
He was good-looking and gave off a friendly vibe. He smiled and started to rub his rosary beads, and then the avatar disappeared immediately as though it was just an illusion.
Bodhisattva Kuduo heaved a long sigh.
“I’m so bored! Master punished me to copy the entire sutra!
“Fortunately, Fang Chang suffered a Qi Deviation, and I managed to escape from him. Thank you, Fang Chang!
“Sister Yunxi! Hello! I haven’t seen you in half a year. Do you want to test out my skill now?
“Erm, are you new around here? Your looks are comparable to mine. How should I address you? Do you want to test out my skills too?”
The monk’s sudden change of demeanor astounded Shen Tian. He stared at the rosary beads Bodhisattva Kuduo was holding and asked, “What was that avatar just now?”
Kuduo smiled. “That’s my Master’s item. What you saw earlier was just an illusion.”



                            SIGN IN
                        

Bodhisattva Kuduo explained, “I have never liked Buddhist scriptures, so I could not form the Bodhi avatar. The avatar just now was cast by my Master, an illusion stored within these Bodhi beads. Master had said that I was too easygoing. As the Bodhisattva of a sacred ground, I did not have the magnanimity and…”
Speaking till here, Bodhisattva Kuduo seemed to be unable to think of a suitable word.
Shen Tian seemed to be deep in thought. “Posh? Grandeur?”
Bodhisattva Kuduo hurriedly nodded. “That’s right, posh and grandeur, but what does posh mean? Sigh… Never mind! Anyway, Master demanded that I must activate the avatar when I am outside. Otherwise, he won’t let me leave, and I will be punished by copying the Buddhist scriptures’ passages. He’s simply heartless!”
Seeing Kuduo, who felt he was very wronged, Shen Tian could not help but secretly mourn for the Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground.
The Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground is so tragic to have such a Saint!
As the Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground’s Bodhisattva, isn’t fronting your responsibility? If you don’t show off your power, who would know of Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground’s name? Right!
One had to know that Buddhism’s cultivation method was the art of relic merit. It was different from the way of Dao.
The Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground originated from the West Desert Paradise. They were a foreign sacred ground.
As the cultivation art of relic merit had yet to take firm root among the masses, it was not easy for them to find disciples to cultivate Buddhism. Thus, presently, the Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground’s Bodhisattva, who was traveling, was extremely important!
If, while wearing clothing as white as snow, the Bodhisattva could flaunt his power as much as possible, then naturally, the sacred ground would have face.
However, the Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground just had to have such a blockhead. He traveled to many places, killing demons and fiends, thus accumulating merit, but he just did not know how to be a poser. Such an honest person, how could he help his sect to promote Buddhism and expand the sect?
The Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground’s leader had no other choice but to make a Buddhist artifact and force Bodhisattva Kuduo to bring it if he had to go outside. Thus, it could be seen how helpless the Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground was to the point of going nuts with such an honest and upright Saint.
However, even though Bodhisattva Kuduo made the Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground’s leader feel so resigned, his position was still as firm as a rock that no one could threaten it. That also reflected from another aspect the talent and strength of Bodhisattva Kuduo—it was indeed quite astonishing.
Yeap, both have well-developed limbs but a moronic head. The same dislike for reading books and always being punished to face the wall.
Shen Tian confirmed that this fellow was Fang Chang’s ‘true’ brother.
Just as Shen Tian was commenting about Bodhisattva Kuduo in his heart, the doors of the White Lotus Mountain’s secret room gradually opened, and a few people walked out.
The person walking in front was the Divine Firmament’s Sacred Leader. He was surrounded by lightning and heavenly aura, majestic and unfathomable.
Meanwhile, on the Sacred Leader’s left and right were the old Taoist priest, Heavenly Venerable Azure Lotus, and a dignified woman in white, respectively.
That woman wore a long white dress, and her ink-black hair covered her shoulders. It was as if a fairy had descended.
Her face was not as exquisite as Zhang Yunxi’a, but she emitted a holy, motherly radiance. It made one feel close to her just by looking at her as if they were related.
The white-clothed woman was the Peak Leader of the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground’s White Lotus Mountain—Heavenly Venerable White Lotus.
She was the kindest and most gentle elder in the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground, as well as the dream lover of countless disciples.
As compared to other elders, who were discreet in speech and manner and always held themselves aloft, Heavenly Venerable White Lotus almost never got angry. She was easy to approach.
At the same time, as she mainly cultivated the Butterfly Immortal Sutra and White Feather Medical Sutra, she was also proficient in the art of healing. All of the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground’s disciples would go to the White Lotus Mountain to heal if they were injured or poisoned. That was also the reason why all of the Divine Firmament’s disciples treated the White Lotus Mountain as a holy land.
Every female disciple in the White Lotus Mountain was extremely popular in the sect!
Upon seeing the few elders coming out, Zhang Yunting and Kuduo hurriedly walked up to them.
They said simultaneously, “Master/Sacred Leader, how is Senior Brother/Fang Chang’s injury?”
Their words were filled with concern, but the looks they gave each other were not that friendly. That was because Zhang Yunting thought that the reason his Senior Brother was this simple-minded was largely because… one takes the behavior of one’s company!
Meanwhile, Bodhisattva Kuduo thought that Zhang Yunting would just read ancient books and was simply an enigmatic person.
He had taken a liking to Fang Chang at first sight, and they often learned from each other by having friendly spars. He was extremely annoyed with Zhang Yunting, who was always following Fang Chang around!
Thus, every time Zhang Yunting and Kuduo met, they would definitely bicker.
However, this time, it was rare to see that they did not argue anymore.
The Sacred Leader looked at Kuduo calmly. “So it was Bodhisattva Kuduo.”
Kuduo replied respectfully, “I greet the Sacred Leader. Please forgive me for coming without invitation.”
The Sacred Leader said, “Not at all. I am very relieved that Chang’er has a good friend like you. It’s a pity that Chang’er’s injury has only barely stabilized. He is still unable to meet guests, so I’m afraid you won’t be able to see him.”
Bodhisattva Kuduo took out a small golden bottle. “I heard that Senior Brother Fang Chang is in trouble. I specially asked for this Golden Body Potion from my Master. I hope that it can be of some help.”
The moment that the Golden Body Potion appeared, it was as if chanting sutras’ sounds could be heard.
A faint fragrance escaped the jade bottle, and it made one’s body feel extremely comfortable. That was the ultimate treasure of their sect, the Golden Body Potion. It was the supreme treasure for those cultivating Buddhism to gather their relic and form the Golden Body.
Only when the Holy Monk passed into parinirvana could they create a little by consuming the Golden Body’s essence.
To the Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground, each bottle of Golden Body Potion was their core resource—its preciousness was immeasurable. Even Bodhisattva Kuduo, the core inheritor, could at most use a small bottle.
Bodhisattva Kuduo was actually willing to give a whole bottle of Golden Body Potion to Fang Chang to help him heal. One had to say, the brotherhood of these two bottom-feeders was truly deep!
The Sacred Leader said calmly, “I appreciate your kindness in Chang’er’s stead. However, Chang’er’s injury was because his Golden Core had cracked. The Golden Body Potion is the supreme treasure to strengthen one’s body. Thus, this Golden Body Potion would not be of much use to Chang’er’s injury. Bodhisattva, please keep it and use it yourself!”
Bodhisattva Kuduo instantly pulled a long face. “Even the Golden Body Potion is useless? Is it possible that Fang Chang is going to die?”
Upon hearing Bodhisattva Kuduo’s words, Shen Tian facepalmed.
This Bodhisattva was really straightforward…
Although what he said was not wrong, he actually said in front of the Sacred Leader that his disciple was going to die?
With such a Bodhisattva, the Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground’s hope of promoting Buddhism in the Eastern Wilderness was most likely an unachievable dream!
It was fortunate that the Sacred Leader had cut off his emotions and desires, so he was extremely rational. Thus, he did not think what Kuduo said was inappropriate.
He replied calmly, “It’s unlikely to result in death. But his Golden Core cracked, so it’s challenging to keep his cultivation.
“If Chang’er is lucky, maybe, he might cultivate again in the future.
“If Chang’er is unlucky, he will most likely not be able to cultivate anymore.”
Once the Sacred Leader finished, everyone’s minds were weighed down with anxiety.
To cultivators, especially a top genius of the Eastern Wilderness like Fang Chang, being unable to cultivate was simply like turning into a good-for-nothing. If he had to live like this, it would be better to die directly!
Such a result was too cruel to Fang Chang, who firmly believed he was “invincible”!
In an instant, the mood in the whole White Lotus Mountain turned heavy.
At that moment, starlight cascaded the White Lotus Mountain as a Big Dipper avatar illuminated the sky with its starlight.
The seven stars shone radiantly, vaguely gathering to form the shape of a huge spoon. It seemed to have the great grandeur of “scooping the countless stars in the sky at once”!
That’s right—another guest had arrived on the White Lotus Mountain!



                            SIGN IN
                        

As the avatar of the Big Dipper could be seen, a man wearing silver battle armor appeared. His eyebrows were sharp like a sword, and he had star-like dazzling eyes. His whole body was surrounded by starlight.
The moment he appeared, the Big Dipper avatar shone even more radiantly, as if the god of stars had descended. He seemed to be of around the same age as Zhang Yunting and others, but his aura was mighty. It was vaguely even stronger than Bodhisattva Kuduo.
This man appeared at the White Lotus Mountain and bowed to the Divine Firmament’s Sacred Leader. “I am Chen Zhongtian from the Big Dipper Sacred Ground. I greet the Divine Firmament’s Sacred Leader!”
Although he was bowing, his presence still compelling, he did not restrain his aura at all. Evidently, his aim for coming to Divine Firmament was not as friendly as it seemed.
The Sacred Leader looked at Chen Zhongtian coldly. “Not bad, you’ve already reached the Nascent Soul stage.”
His words left all onlookers astonished, secretly becoming more vigilant.
The Big Dipper’s Saint, Chen Zhongtian, was originally ranked 4th in the Golden Core List. His talent was only below Qi Shaoxuan, Bodhisattva Kuduo, and Fang Chang.
However, Chen Zhongtian did not continue staying in the Golden Core Eight Refinement Stage like the others. Instead, he resolutely decided to break through to the Nascent Soul stage with Golden Core Eight Refinement Stage as his foundation. Thus, Chen Zhongtian’s strength had increased by many times. He was no weaker than the three geniuses who previously overshadowed him.
Most likely, even if Bodhisattva Kuduo went all out, he might not be able to match up to Chen Zhongtian and might even be defeated badly.
Chen Zhongtian turned and glanced at Bodhisattva Kuduo. He smiled and said, “I did not expect for Senior Brother Kuduo to come here too.”
Bodhisattva Kuduo replied in an angry tone, “Why? Even you can come to muddy the waters, why can’t I?”
Chen Zhongtian chuckled. “I’m not here to cause trouble, don’t speak nonsense!”
As he spoke, the Big Dipper’s Saint took a small jade bottle out of his ring and gave it to the Divine Firmament’s Sacred Leader respectfully.
Chen Zhongtian introduced, “I heard that Senior Brother Fang Chang’s life is in danger from failing to break through to the Golden Core Ninth Refinement Stage. It really hurts to hear that.
“This is the supreme treasure, Nirvana Holy Liquid, that Senior Brother Shaoxuan had entrusted me to bring to help heal Senior Brother Fang Chang.
“Such a precious treasure contains limitless vitality and can even heal Dao injuries. Maybe, it can be useful to Senior Brother Fang Chang.”
Once Chen Zhongtian finished, the sound of someone taking in a sharp breath resounded. It was the astounded Li Yunfeng.
Upon sensing the puzzled looks of the surrounding people, Li Yunfeng explained, “He’s really generous!”
Zhao Hao asked in curiosity, “Why? Senior Brother Yunfeng has heard of such a thing?”
Li Yunfeng nodded. “Naturally, I am the Divine Firmament Know-It-All! Do you know what the Nirvana Holy Liquid is? Do you know how precious it is?”
Seeing that everyone showed him the “please start your performance” expression, Li Yunfeng started to talk tirelessly and vividly.
“The Nirvana Holy Liquid is a supreme treasure that can only be formed if plant-type demons willingly sacrifice themselves and refine their own essence.
“Some powerful plant-type Demon Kings might choose to undergo Nirvana and enter deep sleep, awaiting their chance of resurrection.
“They would refine their huge body into the purest energy essence to be consumed during Nirvana.
“Normally, only plant-type demons at the peak of Soul Formation and above can undergo Nirvana.
“Also, the plant demon must choose to create the Nirvana Holy Liquid willingly for it to have satisfactory efficacy.
“If you were to force plant-type demons to undergo Nirvana, how would it be possible that they would be willing, right?
“That is to say, for the Nirvana Holy Liquid to be formed, three conditions must be satisfied.
“Firstly, finding a mighty plant-type demon with cultivation level at the peak of Soul Formation or above.
“Secondly, that demon must willingly undergo Nirvana and refine their body into the Nirvana Holy Liquid.
“Thirdly, in the short period where the Nirvana Holy Liquid is formed, one must find the Nirvana Holy Liquid and collect it.
“As long as one of the three conditions is not satisfied, then it will be impossible to obtain the Nirvana Holy Liquid. The conditions could be said to be harsh.”
Upon listening to Li Yunfeng’s description of the Nirvana Holy Liquid, Shen Tian had mixed feelings. He looked at the Sacred Leader and Chen Zhongtian standing at the side silently.
He saw that the Sacred Leader had opened the bottle containing the Nirvana Holy Liquid.
Instantly, the rich, fragrant scent of spirit herb spread throughout the room.
Shen Tian was extremely familiar with such a fragrance, but it also seemed a little different.
Shen Tian could vaguely see that there was liquid within the bottle the Sacred Leader was holding. However, that liquid was not silvery-white but pink, extremely illusory.
The Sacred Leader nodded slightly. “This Nirvana Holy Liquid should be created by a mighty demon at the peak of Soul Formation stage.
“If I’m not wrong, this should be the Holy Liquid created by a Peony Flower Demon undergoing Nirvana. It is quite rare.”
Chen Zhongtian stared at the Sacred Leader. “The Sacred Leader is amazing, indeed. I admire your broad range of knowledge.”
The Sacred Leader said, “This Nirvana Holy Liquid is very useful to Chang’er. I am grateful to the two Saints.”
Chen Zhongtian replied, “I am but just running an errand. I could never be in possession of such a supreme treasure. Truthfully speaking, this Nirvana Holy Liquid is actually Senior Brother Shaoxuan’s gift to Junior Sister Yunxi. Gentlemen desire a kind and beautiful woman. Shaoxuan Shaoxuan has always admired—”
Before Chen Zhongtian could finish, the Sacred Leader interrupted him. “What do you mean?”
The Sacred Leader looked at Chen Zhongtian coldly. “Why is Qi Shaoxuan not here to say this himself?”
Chen Zhongtian replied respectfully, “Sacred Leader, please calm down. Senior Brother Shaoxuan is preparing for the Golden Core Tenth Refinement Stage!
“He heard that Senior Brother Fang Chang had suffered from Qi Deviation from when trying to break through to the Golden Core Ninth Refinement Stage. He’s worried that Junior Sister Yunxi might be worried due to it.”
“Thus, he immediately asked me to bring this Nirvana Holy Liquid and rush here to save Senior Brother Fang Chang.
“When Shaoxuan Shaoxuan succeeds in achieving the Golden Core Tenth Refinement Stage, he will definitely come to ask for her hand personally.”
Chen Zhongtian might sound polite and appropriate on the surface, but if one carefully analyzed, then it would not be hard for them to understand the hidden meaning.
The Divine Firmament Sacred Ground was one of the oldest amongst all sacred grounds. Meanwhile, the Big Dipper Sacred Ground and Purple Mansion Sacred Ground were both relatively new sacred grounds.
The sacred grounds’ relationships were complicated. Naturally, some were close, and some were in conflict.
The Divine Firmament Sacred Ground and Purple Mansion Sacred Ground were not on good terms, and they secretly competed against each other.
Currently, the Purple Mansion Sacred Ground had a peerless genius, Qi Shaoxuan, who was said to be blessed by the heavens and had the Ancient Thearch’s talents.
Meanwhile, in the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground, Fang Chang, who was the strongest disciple, had suffered from Qi Deviation when trying to reach the Golden Core Ninth Refinement Stage.
One was about to exceed the limits and reach the Golden Core Tenth Refinement Stage, while the other had failed when at the Ninth Refinement Stage. With the rise of one genius and fall of the other, the Purple Mansion Sacred Ground would naturally not let go of such a good opportunity to display their strength.
Thus, the so-called desire to marry Zhang Yunxi might really be what Qi Shaoxuan wanted, but more importantly, it was to purposely provoke the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground!
The Sacred Leader held the Nirvana Holy Liquid coldly, and lightning shot out of his palm. The jade bottle was instantly destroyed, and the pink liquid the size of one’s palm floated in the sky.
The rich, fragrant scent could be smelled in the whole White Lotus Mountain, and countless people started desiring it.
The Sacred Leader said coldly, “Everyone says that Qi Shaoxuan is the Son of Providence, but I see this is all there is to him.
“He wants to marry my daughter with this bit of Nirvana Holy Liquid? Have the both of you ‘Saints’ seen what a true fortuitous opportunity is?”
Chen Zhongtian explained, “Sacred Leader, you must be joking. This is the legendary Nirvana Holy Liquid! Just a drop can save one’s life, and a bottle of it is already a priceless treasure! Besides Qi Shaoxuan, who could be this generous and righteous? Who could just give such a priceless treasure?”



                            SIGN IN
                        

Evidently, the Big Dipper’s Saint was a loyal supporter of Qi Shaoxuan, and he immediately beamed with joy when mentioning his name.
“This holy liquid is enough for Senior Brother Fang Chang to stabilize his Dao injury. At the very least, it can help him survive.”
“Qi Shaoxuan has said that this Nirvana Holy Liquid he gifted to Junior Sister Yunxi is only to show his sincerity. If Junior Sister Yunxi is willing to marry him, then more holy liquid is nothing difficult. This could allow Senior Brother Fang Chang to recover completely, and it may not be impossible for him to even reach the Nascent Soul stage.”
A confident smile was plastered on Chen Zhongtian’s face.
It’s Zhang Yunxi’s luck to be able to be liked by Senior Brother Shaoxuan.
In Chen Zhongtian’s mind, just a Zhang Yunxi was not good enough for Qi Shaoxuan at all. Nevertheless, since Qi Shaoxuan had ordered him to go to the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground to ask for her hand in marriage, Chen Zhongtian would not go against his orders.
Although they were both saints, Qi Shaoxuan had the “Thearch’s talents”, so they were not on the same level at all.
Chen Zhongtian was the first Saint to choose to follow Qi Shaoxuan.
In the future, when Qi Shaoxuan becomes an invincible Sage, I will become the most important follower. Would I still lack fortuitous opportunities?
Frankly speaking, the holy liquid Qi Shaoxuan had gifted to Divine Firmament was just a drop of what he possessed. In fact, he had obtained a total of about 50L of Nirvana Holy Liquid during a certain experiential journey.
Divine Firmament’s bottle only contained just 500mL.
Meanwhile, Chen Zhongtian had also been given 500mL.
Due to those 500 grams of Nirvana Holy Liquid, Chen Zhongtian could complete his breakthrough to the Golden Core Eight Refinement Stage and be ranked 4th in the Golden Core List.
Without the Nirvana Holy Liquid’s help, he could at most enter the top 10 of the Golden Core List with his true strength. It was also due to that that Chen Zhongtian did not have the extravagant hope of breaking through to the Golden Core Ninth Refinement Stage.
After stabilizing at the Golden Core Eight Refinement Stage, he had chosen to enter the Nascent Soul stage resolutely.
In his mind, as long as he rode on Qi Shaoxuan’s coattail, achieving Immortal Ascension was just but a matter of time!
…
Upon hearing Chen Zhongtian’s words, Zhang Yunting frowned. “This lackey, Chen Zhongtian, is too treacherous.
“All of the Eastern Wilderness’ sacred grounds’ core disciples know that our First Senior Brother is deeply in love with Xi’er.
“First Senior Brother had always been conceited. Losing his cultivation was enough to upset him, not to mention depending on Xi’er to survive.
“What bullsh*t is he spouting! If Xi’er is willing to marry Qi Shaoxuan, he will be able to obtain more Nirvana Holy Liquid? If Brother Fang relied on Qi Shaoxuan’s Nirvana Holy Liquid, then it would be useless even if he recovered his cultivation or reached the Golden Core Ninth Refinement Stage. He would definitely be unable to accept that, and thus mental demons would form to haunt him!”
Zhang Yunting had inherited the Sacred Leader’s habit of “Like reading books, read good books”. Thus, he could clearly see through Chen Zhongtian and Qi Shaoxuan’s plan.
Nonetheless, even if he knew that those two were up to no good, they could not turn against them. On the contrary, they had to thank them—be it in terms of formality or sentimentality, what Chen Zhongtian did was appropriate.
This was a blatant scheme with two options—either forgo Fang Chang’s life and reject the Nirvana Holy Liquid or endure the humiliation and accept the Nirvana Holy Liquid if they wanted to save Fang Chang.
As for the possibility of those Soul Formation elders directly making a move to teach Chen Zhongtian a lesson? Well, that could not help save the sacred ground’s reputation at all. On the contrary, if they did that, it would make them lose face even more badly since Chen Zhongtian had come as a well-mannered guest. At the same time, Divine Firmament would be stigmatized as a sacred ground that bullied the weak.
In that instant, everyone at the White Lotus Mountain peak was filled with righteous rage.
Well… only the emotionless Sacred Leader and shameless Azure Lotus were still calm.
The Sacred Leader put away the Nirvana Holy Liquid calmly. “Although it is not enough, thank you. As for the matter between Xi’er and the Purple Mansion’s Saint, let Xi’er decide for herself! I would not act in an arbitrary fashion.”
Seeing the Sacred Leader store the Nirvana Holy Liquid without hesitation, Chen Zhongtian could not help but be stunned.
This didn’t go as planned!
I have already flaunted so straightforwardly and even arrogantly belittled Fang Chang.
As the Divine Firmament’s Sacred Leader, shouldn’t you express angrily that you won’t accept this humiliation? Then throw the Nirvana Holy Liquid back in rage, and tell me that you don’t want it and make me take it back?
This way, I would be able to bring the Nirvana Holy Liquid back.
However, what kind of person is Senior Brother Shaoxuan? How could he take back an item he had given? Since the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground wouldn’t accept it, Senior Brother would most likely give it to me.
Chen Zhongtian had engaged in his wishful thinking, but he never expected his grand plan to be overturned. He stood at his spot, dumbfounded. He was in a daze as he did not know what to say.
After a long time, he swallowed his saliva. “Sacred Leader, this bottle of Nirvana Holy Liquid is a gift for Junior Sister Yunxi.”
The Sacred Leader nodded. “I know, I am only helping Xi’er to keep it. Why? Is there a condition for the gift that the Purple Mansion’s Saint gave to Xi’er?”
Chen Zhongtian’s face instantly turned red. “There… There is none.”
The Sacred Leader said, “Since there is none, then do you have any more questions?”
Chen Zhongtian took a deep breath. “Senior Brother Shaoxuan and Junior Sister Yunxi are simply a match made in heaven.
“Sacred Leader, are you really not going to consider it? Senior Brother Shaoxuan said that as long as—”
The Sacred Leader interrupted Chen Zhongtian. “Frankly speaking, my daughter already has someone she likes.”
After saying that, he gradually turned to look at Shen Tian. “Tian’er, come here.”
In that instant, everyone focused their attention on Shen Tian, to which the latter helplessly sighed.
Honestly speaking, he was extremely unhappy now.
Why did I have to encounter such a cliche plot of fighting over a girl? Couldn’t there be any new methods for courting envy?
The Sacred Leader could just directly chase Chen Zhongtian out of the sacred ground after taking the item, but he just had to single me out and make me face that fella!
Shen Tian had already thought of the subsequent plot. One possibility was that he would be humiliated by Chen Zhongtian. However, if that was the case, the Sacred Leader would be upset, the Saintess would be upset, everyone would be upset!
By then, would he still be able to stay in the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground? It was simply a matter of losing face!
The other possibility was that Shen Tian had to think of ways to return the humiliation and show off the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground’s strength. However, the Purple Mansion’s Saint would definitely hold a grudge against him if that was the case.
By then, they would come to seek him for revenge. If the young one failed, then the older and more powerful ones would take action—one after the other, extremely annoying!
Shen Tian, who was filled with helplessness, walked before the Sacred Leader. “Greetings, Master.”
The Sacred Leader nodded in satisfaction. “Big Dipper’s Saint, this is my sect’s new Saint, Shen Tian.
“The Saint’s coronation is already being prepared, and the invitations to the major sacred grounds will be sent soon.
“Meanwhile, he is the one my daughter likes.”
Chen Zhongtian stared straight at Shen Tian. Frankly speaking, he had not noticed him previously. Now that he stood in front of Shen Tian, Chen Zhongtian suddenly felt a humongous pressure, nonetheless.
There… There is actually someone with such extraordinary handsomeness!? His presence is simply too astonishing! Especially the outstanding and elegant temperament he is giving off!
Chen Zhongtian even thought that this person was even more like the reincarnation of an immortal with a heavenly aura than Qi Shaoxuan.
It’s no wonder Zhang Yunxi likes him!
“…”
Darn it! How did the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground find such an extraordinary Saint!? Just what are those disciples in the intel-gathering department doing!?
Chen Zhongtian felt that he no longer had the upper hand.
His aura was being suppressed while he was starting to feel ashamed of himself!
He had… lost his arrogance!

Shen Tian was extremely conflicted as he had to face the Big Dipper’s Saint. He was thinking of how he should humiliate Chen Zhongtian and make it seem as if it was something natural.
Meanwhile, in Chen Zhongtian’s eyes, Shen Tian had an “indifferent and aloof” expression.
As expected of the Divine Firmament’s Saint. Not only does he have a dignified and imposing appearance, but he’s also neither conceited nor rash. He must be extremely open-minded.
Chen Zhongtian inwardly admired Shen Tian.
Although the Big Dipper and Divine Firmament were not on good terms, the sacred grounds’ evaluations of each other were basically the same. It would not be too biased because of one’s position.
In Chen Zhongtian’s opinion, the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground’s true disciples were basically useless, and his belief intensified when he brought out the Nirvana Holy Liquid, which was a part of Qi Shaoxuan’s fortuitous opportunity.
He used a blatant scheme to suppress the Divine Firmament, and those true disciples had let their emotion get the better of them, completely unable to conceal their anger. Their mindsets could not be compared to the Sacred Leader—this sly old fox—at all!
On the other hand, this new Saint’s face didn’t betray the slightest hint of anger. He just looked at Chen Zhongtian emotionlessly. Even Chen Zhongtian, who was proficient in reading others, could not guess what Shen Tian was thinking.
More importantly, Chen Zhongtian had already broken through to the Nascent Soul stage faster than those of the same age, yet he was unable to sense Shen Tian’s cultivation level when facing him.
This Shen Tian is as mysterious as a vast ocean or a black hole. I’m unable to see through him. He must be a fearsome existence, comparable to Senior Brother Shaoxuan!
No!
Chen Zhongtian shook his head forcibly.
This is a misconception, an illusion that this fellow has cast on me!
How could I question Senior Brother Shaoxuan’s authority just because this guy has a dignified and imposing appearance?
Senior Brother Shaoxuan is unique and unmatched! So what if this fellow’s cultivation level is quite strong and has a heavenly aura?
The most important thing in the cultivation world is one’s divine destiny. Only if one is blessed by providence and encounters fortuitous opportunities will they be protected by the Heavenly Dao at all times.
Senior Brother Shaoxuan obtained about 50L of Nirvana Holy Liquid on a random experiential journey. Can this guy do that?
At that thought, Chen Zhongtian finally calmed himself down. “Senior Brother Shen, I’ve often heard about your great name.”
Shen Tian was still in conflict whether to offend Chen Zhongtian, so he replied out of reflex, “Where did you hear it?”
“…”
I was only making a polite remark! WTF do you mean where did I hear it? You’re taking advantage of my polite remark!
Chen Zhongtian took a deep breath. “Senior Brother Shen, I mean, it’s a pleasure to meet you.”
“Not for me,” Shen Tian could not help but murmur upon seeing Chen Zhongtian’s bright yet fake smile.
Frankly speaking, if Chen Zhongtian was only dissing Shen Tian himself, the latter might just laugh it off as Chen Zhongtian also had a pale gold halo. There was no need to have a dispute. The problem was, the Big Dipper Sacred Ground was dissing the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground, making things difficult!
The Sacred Leader had called out Shen Tian to face Chen Zhongtian one on one. If he failed to meet up to the Sacred Leader’s expectations, what if the Sacred Leader stacked the deck against him?
In the end, Shen Tian could only adjust his mindset. He had to be innovative and deal critical hits with each strike!
However, honestly speaking, it was really not easy to do it.
Just as Shen Tian was deep in thought, a drastic change occurred on White Lotus Mountain once again. A female disciple in white ran out of the secret room, her face full of panic and at a loss.
“Bad news, bad news! Sacred Leader, Martial Uncle, Master, First Senior Brother’s Golden Core started to crack once again!”
Like a boulder falling into the lake, that female disciple’s words resulted in a raging torrent.
The lightning and heavenly aura surrounding the Sacred Leader slightly fluctuated as he walked into the secret room. The old Taoist priest and Heavenly Venerable White Lotus followed closely behind.
The other true disciples saw that no one stopped them, so they also followed behind tightly.
This drastic change allowed Chen Zhongtian to heave a sigh of relief. He was under huge pressure when facing Shen Tian.
“Senior Brother Fang Chang is in danger? Senior Brother Shen, let’s get to know each other later. We should go and see Senior Brother Fang Chang first!”
Shen Tian nodded and walked toward the secret room where Fang Chang was, extremely anxious. He was about to see Fang Chang and did not wish for anything to happen to him. He also did not hope that Fang Chang’s Qi Deviation had something to do with him.
Although Shen Tian frequently deceived people to freeload their providence, he was a good person.
Everyone entered the secret room and quickly arrived at the White Lotus Mountain’s core healing ground.
The Sacred Leader and others had already entered a special array formation space, which isolated everyone else. The array formation space was transparent, so Shen Tian and the others could see the scenery within—Fang Chang lying on a bed.
He had become much thinner, while his face was white as a sheet and seemed to have been injured heavily. Of course, that was not the main point—the important thing was his halo had changed.
When Shen Tian had first encountered Fang Chang, his halo had been pure gold. However, now, Shen Tian could see that Fang Chang’s halo had turned to a mixture of gold and red.
Evidently, Fang Chang’s providence was decreasing, the reason obvious. Shen Tian confirmed his speculation—it was because of him!
It seemed that the people from whom Shen Tian stole their fortuitous opportunities would not only face a decrease in providence, but they might even face a calamity!
…
The Sacred Leader took out the fist-sized Nirvana Holy Liquid within the array formation space. He refined the Nirvana Holy Liquid’s drops, which in turn entered Fang Chang’s body and restored the cracks.
Facts proved that the Nirvana Holy Liquid was indeed useful to Fang Chang as the hideous cracks on his Golden Core were being healed.
Although that was good news, brutal bad news followed—Fang Chang’s injury had worsened, and 500mL of Nirvana Holy Liquid were not sufficient.
After the Nirvana Holy Liquid was completely absorbed, only a few of the cracks on his Golden Core had healed. According to the number of cracks on Fang Chang’s Golden Core, this bit of Nirvana Holy Liquid was not even enough to save Fang Chang’s life.
Boom!
The door of the array formation space opened. Heavenly Venerable White Lotus walked out of it in a hurry, and she stared right at Chen Zhongtian.
“Do you still have any more Nirvana Holy Liquid? I can pay twice the price to buy it and also owe you a favor.”
Heavenly Venerable White Lotus was a famous expert doctor in the Eastern Wilderness, and her favor was quite valuable.
It was only a pity that Chen Zhongtian really did not have any Nirvana Holy Liquid left—that was a priceless treasure, after all.
He sighed and replied, “Heavenly Venerable, please forgive me. I really don’t have any Nirvana Holy Liquid left, so I am unable to help. If time permits, I can rush to the Purple Mansion Sacred Ground and try to ask for more holy liquid.”
Heavenly Venerable White Lotus shook her head. “It will be too late. Fang Chang cannot last without the holy liquid.”
Chen Zhongtian thought, Looks like Fang Chang is going to die today.
Fang Chang’s injury is severe, and his condition in critical danger. Without more than 25L of Nirvana Holy Liquid, it will be impossible for him to recover completely.
25L of Nirvana Holy Liquid is so precious that even Senior Brother Shaoxuan will feel the pinch if he were to part with it.
In Chen Zhongtian’s mind, the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground should start making arrangements for Fang Chang’s funeral. There was no need to persevere anymore.
Unexpectedly, at that moment, Shen Tian’s voice echoed.
“Aunt-Master White Lotus, could you see if what this bottle contains is the Nirvana Holy Liquid?”
As he spoke, a small jade bottle appeared in Shen Tian’s hands. It was filled with a silvery-white liquid, full of vitality.
Chen Zhongtian was petrified at the sight of that!


CHAPTER 172: HOW CAN I ACCEPT THIS MUCH OF JUNIOR BROTHER’S NIRVANA HOLY LIQUID?

1
Translator: Atlas Studios  Editor: Atlas Studios
The rich, fragrant scent permeated the whole room.
Chen Zhongtian could confirm that the bottle contained Nirvana Holy Liquid. Also, it was supreme-grade, a grade higher than the Peony Nirvana Holy Liquid.
The Divine Firmament Sacred Ground’s new Saint has also obtained such a huge fortuitous opportunity? How is it possible!?
Chen Zhongtian was questioning himself!
That’s right! This fellow only has a small bottle of it. Senior Brother Shaoxuan has 50L of it. Senior Brother is still better!
After forcibly finding an excuse to comfort himself, Chen Zhongtian heaved a sigh of relief at last.
Heavenly Venerable White Lotus looked at the jade bottle in astonishment.
“Such pure holy liquid. Its quality is much better than that previous bottle. It’s just… How much of it do you have?”
“Aunt-Master White Lotus, I assure you that there’s definitely enough. I won’t disappoint you.”
Shen Tian opened the jade bottle, and a ball of silver liquid flowed out, floating in front of everyone. In that instant, an unprecedented rich, fragrant scent intoxicated everyone.
Its mere sight dumbfounded Chen Zhongtian—he even doubted whether he had grown a pair of fake eyes.
The ball of Nirvana Holy Liquid before them was at least 50L in weight. That was to say, the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground’s Saint actually possessed 50L of Nirvana Holy Liquid. What was more astounding was that its quality surpassed the one in Qi Shaoxuan’s possession!
For a moment, Chen Zhongtian started doubting himself. He remembered what the Sacred Leader had stated earlier.
The Sacred Leader had stated that he had not seen what a true fortuitous opportunity was.
Chen Zhongtian had been under the impression that it was just something the Sacred Leader had purposely said in anger. However, now, Chen Zhongtian could only feel extreme embarrassment, and he even wanted the ground to open up and swallow him.
The Sacred Leader had thought nothing of the 500mL of Nirvana Holy Liquid. Who told him to be so smug!?
Using 500mL of Nirvana Holy Liquid to ask for Zhang Yunxi’s hand? He was just a joke in the Sacred Leader’s eyes!
Chen Zhongtian could only feel his Dao Heart breaking apart.
The worst thing in the world was not others purposely flaunting in front of one. On the contrary, it was the other person simply not caring what the flaunter was doing and only thinking they were clowns from the start till the end.
Currently, these were Chen Zhongtian’s thoughts. He was in a rather awkward position.
However, no one was interested in paying attention to him now as everyone was mesmerized by the ball of Nirvana Holy Liquid.
White Lotus’ eyes lit up. “So much! Too much!”
Shen Tian stored the Nirvana Holy Liquid back into the bottle. “Use it to save Senior Brother Fang Chang!”
Frankly speaking, Shen Tian had wanted to share the Nirvana Holy Liquid with Fang Chang for a long time now, but he just could not find the chance to do so.
Fang Chang had still been undergoing emergency treatment for a few days now, so Shen Tian could not come into contact with him. Also, Shen Tian did not know that the silvery-white liquid was Nirvana Holy Liquid and could heal Fang Chang’s Golden Core.
Since everything was clear now, Shen Tian was naturally willing to return Fang Chang’s portion of his fortuitous opportunity. In addition, the holy liquid he had seen in Fang Chang’s halo could fill a small pond, while all the holy liquid Shen Tian had obtained could fill a lake. Thus, even if he gave all of Fang Chang’s portion back to him, Shen Tian was totally fine with it.
Of course, Shen Tian thought it was fine, but the others did not think that way.
Shen Tian’s willingness to give Fang Chang the whole bottle astonished Chen Zhongtian.
The Divine Firmament’s Saint is actually willing to give all of this priceless and precious holy liquid to save Fang Chang? He’s really too noble, generous, and sublime!
Chen Zhongtian felt ashamed of himself. If it were him that had obtained so much Nirvana Holy Liquid, he would most likely not take it out. The same applied for the Purple Mansion’s Saint, Qi Shaoxuan; even if his Junior or Senior Brothers/Sisters needed it, he would most probably not be this generous.
Not mentioning Shen Tian’s other virtues, his magnanimity alone was enough to declare him as the winner of this confrontation.
Chen Zhongtian looked at Shen Tian’s back blankly. His contest with Shen Tian had not even begun, but Chen Zhongtian knew he had already lost—it was an overwhelming defeat.
White Lotus took a deep look at Shen Tian before she brought that bottle into the array formation.
Chen Zhongtian considered after careful thinking, and then he walked to Shen Tian.
“Senior Brother Shen, I have lost.”
What, you lost?
Shen Tian was completely bewildered.
What do you mean you lost? I haven’t started flaunting! Why have you already admitted defeat? How can I humiliate you and complete my mission now?
Chen Zhongtian said in reverence, “Senior Brother Shen, I have a question. Could you please provide an answer for me?”
Shen Tian nodded. “Ask away.”
Chen Zhongtian asked, “Senior Brother Shen, how could you give that much Nirvana Holy Liquid without hesitation? The Nirvana Holy Liquid can heal Dao injuries, and it could be said to be a priceless treasure. Is it because of your deep brotherhood relationship that you are this generous?”
Shen Tian looked at Chen Zhongtian as if he was looking at a dunderhead.
“The Nirvana Holy Liquid is a medicine. Isn’t medicine’s purpose to heal injuries and sickness?”
Shen Tian’s words resounded within Chen Zhongtian’s mind as if it contained some kind of truth. Chen Zhongtian seemed to have understood something and fell into a daze.
At that moment, the secret room’s door opened once again, and White Lotus walked out.
She said helplessly, “That foolish Fang Chang said he did not want to owe you such a big favor. He said that the Nirvana Holy Liquid is too precious. He won’t be able to return it, and in the future, you might need the Nirvana Holy Liquid too.
“That kid just had to hold out and not use the Nirvana Holy Liquid. We can’t force him.”
Shen Tian listened to White Lotus, utterly dumbfounded.
This idiot! You’re about to die, but why are you still dead-determined to save face!?
Shen Tian looked at the transparent array formation and noticed that Fang Chang had also looked toward the outside. A forced smile was plastered on his pale white face before his mouth started opening and closing as if he was speaking.
Shen Tian tried to read his lips and vaguely understood what he was saying—”The Nirvana Holy Liquid is Junior Brother’s fortuitous opportunity. How can you share this much with me?”
The blockhead amused Shen Tian.
Why the f*ck are you not thinking about yourself instead!?
At that thought, Shen Tian took five small jade bottles out of his Archeon Sea Ring and opened them simultaneously. Then, five thick balls of Nirvana Holy Liquid floated around Shen Tian.
The extremely rich vitality filled the whole secret room, making everyone obsessed with it.
Shen Tian looked at the already stupefied Fang Chang and smiled.
“I still have more!”
After finishing, Shen Tian stored the Nirvana Holy Liquid back into the bottles and stuffed another bottle into White Lotus’ hands.
“Aunt-Master White Lotus, I have enough Nirvana Holy Liquid. Please, you must save Senior Brother.”
1
White Lotus gulped down her saliva and nodded heavily.
“Don’t worry. This time it’s difficult even if Fang Chang wants to die!”
Heavenly Venerable White Lotus walked into the secret room with two whole bottles of Nirvana Holy Liquid.
The nerve-racking emergency treatment process started once again, but the atmosphere was tranquil. Everyone was looking at Shen Tian, dumbstruck and in disbelief, especially Chen Zhongtian.
He had already collapsed onto the ground. His eyes, which already betrayed his internal turmoil, turned blank.
“I must be suffering a Qi Deviation after failing to break through to the Nascent Soul stage. What did I just see? At least 250L of Nirvana Holy Liquid? No, impossible, how could he have so much?
“Fake, fake, it must be fake!
“Ha, haha, hahaha!
“Mental demon illusion, begone!”

Cultivation was not just to increase one’s strength but also their mental fortitude. Thus, the importance of cultivating one’s mental fortitude went without saying.
Be it Qi Refinement, Foundation Establishment, or Golden Core, they were all cultivation realms inclined to one’s strength. However, after the Nascent Soul stage, the cultivation of one’s mental fortitude became even more important—one had to experience the mortal world to train their mind.
If the cultivator firmly believed in their own Dao, they would naturally be able to advance by leaps and bounds in the road of cultivation, improving greatly in a short period. However, if one started to doubt the Dao they had chosen, then mental demons would be easily formed and result in serious injuries.
One’s Dao need not be of the Five Elements or Yin Yang. It could be something minor, such as the Dao of musical instruments, painting and calligraphy, or even the Dao of admiration toward powerful beings.
Rumors said that there had been a peerless emperor in the ancient period that had created the Heavenly Courts, unified the five regions, and had endless territory. That emperor had been invincible, and his believers had also advanced triumphantly in the road of cultivation.
In the end, there were even rumors that the emperor had brought all his followers to ascend to the Infinite Immortal Domain and begun a war.
Meanwhile, this legend, which was unknown whether it was true or fake, had also become a classic example of “When a man gets to the top, all his friends and relations get there with him.”
Thus, many cultivators in the cultivation world knew their aptitude was limited, so they would not insist on taking the invincible Dao. Instead, they would follow those that were more powerful. As long as they were firm that their choice was correct, they could form their own Dao.
Of course, in theory, Saints and Saintesses would not choose this road as the sacred grounds had their pride.
The Saint/Saintess of any sacred ground was the most powerful genius in the 100 years of the sacred ground, representing its reputation.
They could choose any Dao to compete with other talents in the world, but only the Dao of being a follower was a taboo.
Naturally, since Big Dipper’s Saint, Chen Zhongtian, had chosen to follow the Purple Mansion’s Saint, the Big Dipper Sacred Ground had lost face. Even if the Purple Mansion’s Saint had the Thearch’s talents, the Big Dipper Sacred Ground was still unwilling.
As such, numerous people from the Big Dipper had been demanding to replace their current Saint. Nonetheless, Chen Zhongtian was powerful while the genius Qi Shaoxuan’s light was too blinding, suppressing the idle chatter.
Even so, Chen Zhongtian was still upset that people were gossiping and speaking behind his back. He had convinced himself repeatedly that Qi Shaoxuan was a rare genius that could only be found once in 10,000 years in the Eastern Wilderness!
Senior Brother Shaoxuan is unique! He will definitely become a Sage in the future!
My choice proves that I, Chen Zhongtian, truly have discerning eyes that can tell greatness from mediocrity!
Only then did he forcibly stabilize his Dao Heart.
…
By continuing to apotheosize the Purple Mansion’s Saint, Chen Zhongtian could continue to follow him without regrets. His belief was very firm, and the fact that Qi Shaoxuan was also generous, sharing lots of his fortuitous opportunities’ gains, strengthened it.
Chen Zhongtian’s rapid increase in cultivation due to that generosity only made his decision to follow Qi Shaoxuan even more determined.
However, Chen Zhongtian started doubting himself today.
Senior Brother Shaoxuan is the true Son of Providence! He is blessed by the heavens and has the talents of the Thearch.
I came to the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground under Senior Brother Shaoxuan’s orders, so how could I lose face?
Even Senior Brother Shaoxuan only has 50L of Nirvana Holy Liquid, so how is it possible for this Shen Tian to have 250L? Also, the quality of these 250 liters of Nirvana Holy Liquid is even better!
…
What made Chen Zhongtian break down was that Qi Shaoxuan had only shared 500mL of Nirvana Holy Liquid with him after he had been following him for so many years. Yet, it was different in Divine Firmament Sacred Ground!
Fang Chang’s Golden Core had cracked after suffering a Qi Deviation, and the Divine Firmament’s Saint just directly gave him 50L without hesitation!
He was just too generous!
Chen Zhongtian was green with envy—be it his heart or outer appearance, he was green all over.
In order to breakthrough from the Golden Core to Nascent Soul, one had to break their core and form a new soul. They had to use their soul’s power within the Golden Core to form the Nascent Soul of Dao.
The newly-formed Nascent Soul was fragile, which was not only apparent in terms of one’s battle strength. At the same time, the cultivator’s state of mind that had just entered the Nascent Soul stage would also easily be influenced by their emotions.
Eastern Wilderness did not lack cultivators that suffered Qi Deviations due to doubting their Dao after just breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage. Therefore, normally, Golden Core cultivators that had just entered the Nascent Soul stage would enter seclusion to stabilize their cultivation level.
However, Chen Zhongtian had been in a rush to show off, so he had rushed to the Divine Firmament right after reaching the Nascent Soul stage.
In the end, Shen Tian unknowingly showed off in front of him, and thus Chen Zhongtian started to doubt his Dao.
At that moment, his Nascent Soul cultivation level started to be unstable, while his state of mind became abnormal too.
…
Shen Tian did not have the time to care about Chen Zhongtian right now as he was immersed in the pleasure of his providence increasing.
Ah, this feeling is just too awesome!
This kind of feeling, wherein his whole body was relaxed and as if flying at the peak of clouds, ‘forced’ him to want to continue enjoying it.
As the silver Nirvana Holy Liquid entered Fang Chang’s body, Shen Tian could see that the halo on Fang Chang’s head started changing rapidly. The originally faint red and gold halo started to turn pure gold, and it shone even more brightly!
Meanwhile, Shen Tian’s dark green halo turned even a deeper shade of green, and even red light was visible now.
That’s right—red light!
Shen Tian’s halo finally radiated red light!
Currently, Shen Tian felt really relaxed—he was really becoming lucky!
He could now be counted as someone blessed by providence as compared to normal people.
Everyone was silently staring at Fang Chang now.
After a whole bottle of Nirvana Holy Liquid was used on Fang Chang, his Golden Core no longer had any cracks. On the contrary, his whole Golden Core had turned extremely smooth. His body also became buff and full of strength under the nourishment of the Nirvana Holy Liquid.
“Ah!” Fang Chang let out a loud roar, and his Golden Core suddenly emitted an eye-piercing bright light.
Immediately after, cracks gradually appeared once again. However, this time, it was not due to failure, but because he was refining his Golden Core.
That’s right—after the Nirvana Holy Liquid healed his Dao injury, Fang Chang had profited from the misfortune. He had an enlightenment about the mysterious Dao, and thus, he was breaking through now.
The cracks peeled off and revealed the new Golden Core inside, which shone more radiantly before the ninth Dharmic mark slowly appeared.
Fang Chang was currently breaking through to the Golden Core Ninth Refinement Stage, and he had already half-succeeded.
The Divine Firmament’s Sacred Leader nodded slightly. He took the jade bottle in Heavenly Venerable White Lotus’ hand and crushed it.
The surging Nirvana Holy Liquid instantly flew out in the shape of a silver dragon and shot toward Fang Chang rapidly, wrapping him up. Endless vitality surged within Fang Chang’s body, replenishing his consumption.
In that instant, his Golden Core surface’s peeling process became even faster, and the Dharmic mark also became clearer.
The old Taoist priest, who was standing at the side, heaved a sigh of relief and secretly took deep breaths.
The scene of the Sacred Leader using the Nirvana Holy Liquid in such a grandiose manner left Chen Zhongtian slack-jawed.
Chen Zhongtian, who had recovered after barely stabilizing his Dao from being at a loss for more than an hour, directly rolled his eyes to the back and fainted when he saw such a scene.
The Sacred Leader took a look at Chen Zhongtian calmly, and the lightning and heavenly aura around him started to fluctuate.
…
A humongous Qilin avatar formed behind Fang Chang.
In that instant, Fang Chang was surrounded by golden lightning, as if the God of Thunder had descended. He let out a long roar, and eye-blinding radiance exploded from his Golden Core, and the aura his body emitted increased rapidly.
Boom!
The tide of energy exploded before Fang Chang landed on the ground heavily.
“Unfilial disciple, Fang Chang, thanks Master and Aunt-Master for saving me.”
Then, Fang Chang looked at Shen Tian, who was outside the secret room. His eyes were filled with tears.
He murmured, “Junior Brother has given me so much of his fortuitous opportunity’s gains, but I had wanted to compete with him to determine the winner all along.
“Be it in terms of strength, temperament, or broadness of mind, I have all lost.
“Junior Brother, you’re the perfect match for Junior Sister Yunxi.
“I… wish the both of you happiness!”



                            SIGN IN
                        

The secret room’s door opened, revealing the Divine Firmament’s Sacred Leader and the rest of the people.
Fang Chang looked at Shen Tian with bright eyes full of gratitude, “Junior Brother, I will not waste much energy on words of gratitude!
“I, Fang Chang, shall remember your help toward me. In the future, Senior Brother will give up my life for you if you ever need it!”
Bodhisattva Kuduo heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that Fang Chang finally survived the ordeal. In fact, it was a blessing in disguise, and Fang Chang now attained the Golden Core Ninth Refinement Stage!
He took out the Golden Body Potion from his bosom and pushed it toward Shen Tian. “I originally prepared this bottle of Golden Body Potion for Fang Chang to treat his injuries. But since he has recovered, I shall give it to Senior Brother Shen! Do accept it as a token of appreciation from me.”
Bodhisattva Kuduo’s action stumped Shen Tian.
What is this monk thinking about? I, the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground’s Saint, used my Nirvana Holy Liquid to save a fellow cultivator from my own sect. Why do you, an outsider, come and thank me instead?
What, are you Fang Chang’s partner? So… you are thanking me as his family member now???
Shen Tian was thinking hard about how he should reject the gesture when Bodhisattva Kuduo pressed the bottle into his hands.
“Saint, please accept this. The Nirvana Holy Liquid which you gave Fang Chang is much more valuable than this Golden Body Potion. If not for your kind contribution, Fang Chang would not have been able to survive this ordeal. Then I would be really devastated!”
Bodhisattva Kuduo was really serious about what he said. He and Fang Chang were acknowledged as the most simple-minded duo out of the whole Eastern Wilderness cultivator experts stratum. The pair had thus developed a deep friendship over the years and cared for each other even more than those who were real couples!
Heavenly Venerable White Lotus spoke then. “The Golden Body Potion is an extremely sought after treasure for Godfiend cultivators who want to establish a firm foundation. It will provide great help for those who just attained the Transcendence stage and are trying to temper their physique.
“Martial Nephew Shen Tian, if you can use the Golden Body Potion in the tempering process, your physique will definitely be much better refined.”
Bodhisattva Kuduo nodded. “Yes, Saint Shen Tian. Please, don’t stand on ceremony with me anymore, just keep it.”
Seeing that everybody was trying to persuade Shen Tian to keep the Golden Body Potion, Heavenly Venerable Azure Lotus couldn’t help but feel extremely envious. After all, that was the precious Golden Body Potion, which could only be formed when some Buddhist experts exhausted their life’s energies. And each time, only a little bit would be formed!
If only he could get this extreme-grade treasure, he could laugh even in his dreams!
Yet this lad is still standing on ceremony with them—well, he can give it to me if he really doesn’t want it!
To be honest, Heavenly Venerable Azure Lotus was feeling jealous… again!
“Hmm, since Senior Brother Kuduo is so insistent, then I shall not reject your kind gestures anymore.”
Following which, Shen Tian took a bottle of the Nirvana Holy Liquid out of his Archeon Sea Ring.
“However, I cannot accept it for free. The Golden Body Potion is indeed useful, so how about I exchange it with the Nirvana Holy Liquid?”
The Sacred Leader nodded his head at that.
“The Golden Body Potion is a great Buddhist treasure, and its value is actually above that of the Nirvana Holy Liquid. Although Bodhisattva Kuduo only gave you one small bottle, this Golden Body Potion is extremely pure, and there are about a few liters of it in that bottle. If you want to exchange it with something of equivalent value, you can give back around 10L of the Nirvana Holy Liquid. That will do.”
Shen Tian nodded his head and took out 15L of the Nirvana Holy Liquid from the bottle, placing it into another bottle.
“Senior Brother Kuduo, I am very honored to have met you, so please accept 15L of Nirvana Holy Liquid from me!”
Bodhisattva Kuduo was extremely astounded when he saw Shen Tian passing him the bottle.
Although it was true that the Golden Body Potion he gave Shen Tian equated to roughly 10L of the Nirvana Holy Liquid, one shouldn’t just take this calculation at surface value. This was because the Golden Body Potion was most suitable for Godfiend cultivators to temper their bodies, but not for other purposes. This was its greatest limitation.
Meanwhile, although the Nirvana Holy Liquid was not as great as the Golden Body Potion at tempering bodies, it had the powerful effects of healing major Dao injuries, which was much more commonly encountered.
A bottle of the Nirvana Holy Liquid could save lives, and all cultivators could use it.
Bodhisattva Kuduo was almost certain that if he brought back this 15L of Nirvana Holy Liquid to the Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground, he would be able to exchange it for at least eight or even 10L of the Golden Body Potion.
This was why Bodhisattva Kuduo was so shocked at how generous Shen Tian was.
“Er… This cannot do. No, I cannot take that much.”
Yet Shen Tian wasn’t thinking of all that. He was secretly very pleased with himself now!
This was because after Shen Tian took advantage of Fang Chang’s fortuitous opportunity and helped him regain his cultivation, his providence halo had started to emit red glows.
He thus concluded that it was a great idea to be on good terms with those favored people who had gold providence halos.
Shen Tian had a lot of the Nirvana Holy Liquid he had one pond of it in his Archeon Sea Ring, and he would really prefer to use ‘gallon’ as the measurement unit for this item.
But the Golden Body Potion would be very useful for Shen Tian, who had attained the Transcendence stage for his Godfiend cultivation.
If he got the Golden Body Potion, there would be a marked improvement in his physique. To Shen Tian, that meant a greater chance of survival as he roamed the world for fortuitous opportunities!
Moreover, Shen Tian had experimented before—the people who shared in fortuitous opportunities would have a better providence.
Since Shen Tian shared the Nirvana Holy Liquid with Bodhisattva Kuduo, the latter’s providence should have a marked improvement.
Given such an excellent providence, and considering how Shen Tian had established a good relationship with him now, how could his fill of fortuitous opportunities from Bodhisattva Kuduo ever end?
One shouldn’t just fish passively in still waters—they must think of ways to create fortuitous encounters for themselves!
Just like when fleecing sheep wool, one must also feed the sheep that provide the wool!
“Bodhisattva Kuduo, you treat Senior Brother Fang Chang as your brother, and so do I.
“So, doesn’t it mean that both of us are also like good brothers?
“Since both of us are brothers, then please don’t stand on ceremony for just this bit of Nirvana Holy Liquid!”
With that, Shen Tian pressed the bottle of Nirvana Holy Liquid firmly into Bodhisattva Kuduo’s hands.
“If you find it too much, you can also give it to the rest of the disciples at the Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground.
“After all, Sonic Thunder and Divine Firmament have always been on good terms, so it’s really acceptable that you take this Nirvana Holy Liquid. Senior Brother Kuduo, please don’t reject my gift.”
Bodhisattva Kuduo pondered about it for a while and finally kept the bottle.
Shen Tian observed his head intently during this action. Indeed, the golden glows from Bodhisattva Kuduo’s providence halo grew even brighter!
At the same time, Shen Tian’s eyes brightened up—he felt like he was seeing his “sheep” growing more wool right before his eyes.
Shen Tian had an idea then—he started to divide up the rest of his Nirvana Holy Liquid in the original bottle into small bottles. Each small bottle contained about three or four liters of the Nirvana Holy Liquid, and he gave a bottle each to all those who were present in the secret room.
This group of people included Qin Yundi, Zhang Yunting, Zhang Yunxi, and Zhao Hao.
When Shen Tian finished this action, he looked around and was glad to see that the whole secret room shone even more brightly with brilliant providence halos.
That was all his sheep growing fatter and “baa-ing” at him, and all of that sounded like bliss!
Meanwhile, the people who got the gift were flattered by Shen Tian’s gestures. Even though they rejected him vehemently, they still held tightly onto their bottles—”Oh, how can I accept this, Senior Brother? You shouldn’t share so much of your fortuitous opportunity with me!”
In essence, the whole secret chamber was encompassed by harmony and bliss.
…
At that moment, Jiu’er started trembling in his bosom. “Master, I sensed resentment.”
Shen Tian was a bit startled, and when he looked toward the direction Jiu’er pointed out to him, he saw an old Taoist priest staring hard at him.
Correct, that was Heavenly Venerable Azure Lotus. Shen Tian swore he could see green lights of jealousy emitting from his eyes.
A slight tremor ran down Shen Tian’s spine.
Gosh, I almost spelled doom for myself! How could I forget to give gifts to my seniors?
He immediately took three more bottles of the Nirvana Holy Liquid out of his Archeon Sea Ring.
In any case, he had about 200+ bottles of it, so he did not mind at all to give them away.
Shen Tian gave each of the three bottles to the Divine Firmament’s Sacred Leader, and the other two Heavenly Venerables.
“Master, Martial Uncle, and Martial Aunt, I have prepared these three bottles of Nirvana Holy Liquid for you.”
Light ripples appeared on the heavenly aura on the Sacred Leader’s body surface as he looked at Shen Tian’s sincere expression.
He spoke calmly. “Tian’er is such a thoughtful disciple, and I feel very gratified by your gesture. But you should keep these items for your own use! After all, these are great treasures for healing injuries. Tian’er, you also don’t have much of them, so you don’t need to give them to me.”
Shen Tian smiled when he heard the Divine Firmament’s Sacred Leader’s words.
“Oh, this is just a small token of appreciation from me! Master, please accept it. Don’t worry about me. I have more!”
At that, Shen Tian took 10 more bottles out of his Archeon Sea Ring.
All of them gave off the same rich fragrance and glowed with silver radiance.
At once, the whole secret room went still.
Everyone looked at the smiley Shen Tian, who looked ever more humble and innocent.
They had a burning question in their minds—Really, how much more of this Nirvana Holy Liquid do you own? Is there an end to it?
The Sacred Leader looked smugly at Azure Lotus, and there were slight tremors on his body surface’s heavenly aura.
He really wanted to interview his Senior Brother how he felt then!
At that moment, in a certain corner of the secret room…
Chen Zhongtian stirred and regained consciousness.
Unfortunately, he witnessed what passed. The next moment, his body convulsed, and he dropped dead on the ground again.
Hallucination, this must be a hallucination!
What Nirvana Holy Liquid, all this is fake!
My idol, the Purple Mansion’s Saint, has powers rivaling even that of the Heavenly Thearch. He can subdue all demons in the world.
How dare the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground delude me. Just wait till I light up my Holy Fire! I will rule the whole of the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground and make you all kneel in front of me!
Ha, haha, hahaha, hahahahaha!
Those who recite the name of Senior Brother Shaoxuan shall see eternity in reincarnation!
I have seen my path to Immortality in this façade, I am about to become an Immortal now!
Yes!

No one really cared about Chen Zhongtian fainting because he wasn’t being attacked by anyone at the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground.
It was clear that no one could be faulted for this incident.
At this moment, everyone was reveling in happiness at receiving the Nirvana Holy Liquid gift. Shen Tian definitely scored more brownie points in their hearts, especially for Song Fugui, Liu Taiyi, Zhen Zhijia, and their company. They were all the more devoted to Shen Tian now.
After all, they were initially mere ordinary cultivators staying within the Myriad Spirit Garden at the Country of Fire. The person with the most prestigious status amongst them would be Song Fugui, who was the descendant from the sideline of a minor cultivator family. But no one would have expected much of them.
If everything went according to normal tracks, all these people would have no chances of achieving the Golden Core stage, needless to say, have a glimpse of any more advanced stages.
But because they believed in Master Celestial, they had managed to obtain the Divine Lightning Origin from the Divine Firmament Drager Pendant and hence had gotten the chance to progress for their cultivation.
At the same time, they had even gotten to become the inner-sect disciples of the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground and earned the chance to cultivate the Five Heavenly Lightning Cultivation Technique.
If no mishaps happened in the future, all of them could become Golden Core Perfected Ones should they put in efforts for their cultivation!
And now, Shen Tian even gave them so much Nirvana Holy Liquid.
With this Nirvana Holy Liquid, they could build a better Dharmic foundation for themselves.
This meant that it might even be possible for them to become Supremacies with Nascent Souls!
And all this was due to Senior Brother Shen Tian.
To them, it seemed like the Heavenly Dao had started favoring them once they earned Senior Brother Shen Tian’s trust and blessings!
They now recalled how Zhang Yunxi had chided them before—”Can sucking up to Shen Tian really help you achieve Immortal Ascension?”
And they would dearly like to reply to her now, “Yes, it can!”
Meanwhile, after Heavenly Venerable Azure Lotus accepted the Nirvana Holy Liquid, the black halo on his head paled a lot.
As he weighed the jade bottle in his palms, the way he looked at Shen Tian changed to one of fondness.
Such a thoughtful and cute lad. Shen Tian is so much better than his Master!
He looked at Shen Tian and smiled amiably. “Tian’er, you indeed hold up to our aspirations.
“With you around, how will anyone doubt that the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground will not rise to great heights?
“By the way, Tian’er, we have a lot of Elders. You cannot forget them when and favor us more!
“Why don’t you give me more of the liquid now? I will pass it to them on your behalf. I will put in good words for you too.
“Everyone knows me to be a trustable person. No Elders shall accuse you of being unfair then!”
The Sacred Leader spoke slowly. “Senior Brother… Please, restrain yourself. Bodhisattva Kuduo is still here.”
Lightning crackled softly on the Sacred Leader’s body surface as he continued, “Tian’er, keep the rest of the Nirvana Holy Liquid for yourself. This item is great for healing injuries, and you can use it to make many useful medicines. It will enhance the medicines’ effects.”
Following which, the Sacred Leader handed his bottle to Heavenly Venerable White Lotus.
“Junior Sister White Lotus is an expert at making medicines. I believe she will be able to put this Nirvana Holy Liquid to great use.
“And I agree that we cannot forget about the other Elders in our sect. So, Junior Sister White Lotus, I will have to trouble you to use this 100L of Nirvana Holy Liquid here to make Nirvana Pills and distribute it to the rest of the Elders.
“These pills will be of great help to all the Elders. At this same time, it will show Tian’er’s filial piety toward them.”
Heavenly Venerable White Lotus looked at the Divine Firmament’s Sacred Leader the way one would look at their idols, and there were bright sparks in her eyes.
She spoke resolutely. “Since Senior Brother took the lead, I shall use my bottle of the Nirvana Holy Liquid to make the pills too! 200L of the Nirvana Holy Liquid will definitely be enough to make pills for all the Elders.”
At that, Heavenly Venerable White Lotus turned and smiled innocently at Heavenly Venerable Azure Lotus.
All at once, the old Taoist priest’s face darkened. He felt that he was being led into a trap by both of his juniors.
What are you guys implying here? Shen Tian took out three bottles, and he gave one to each of us.
But now both of you announced that you would ‘take the lead’ to donate yours to make pills? Isn’t it like hinting to me to do so too?
But then, only you guys will know how you are going to distribute the pills!
Urgh, the two of you are so unscrupulous!
After being your Senior Brother for near to thousands of years, you two are actually trying to trick me! Don’t you all have consciences?
Fancy choosing to say all that in front of the younger generation! Aren’t you trying to embarrass me and coerce me into giving up my Nirvana Holy Liquid bottle?
Haha, you are belittling me! When have I ever cared about others’ opinions of me!
Heavenly Venerable Azure Lotus looked down silently at his hands and pretended that he heard nothing.
…
Surprisingly, Heavenly Venerable Azure Lotus’s words did indeed remind Shen Tian of something.
Oh yeah, the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground has so many Elders and experts. All these chaps’ providences must be quite good, and they are my potential “sheep”!
Well, it actually makes no difference whether I feed one or the whole herd of “sheep”.
I should use this opportunity to establish a good relationship with them now so that I can share in their future fortuitous opportunities!
With that in mind, Shen Tian started fishing 10 bottles of the Nirvana Holy Liquid out of his Archeon Sea Ring.
“Oh dear, I am indeed careless to have forgotten the other Elders. Master, I hope you will forgive me for this. I will contribute all 10 bottles of the Nirvana Holy Liquid here to the sacred ground! Master, please help me distribute them to the Elders.”
When Shen Tian finished his words, he saw everybody staring at him as if he was a monster.
The heavenly aura on the Sacred Leader’s body surface started vibrating vigorously again. “Tian’er, are you telling me that you still have more of the Nirvana Holy Liquid?”
Shen Tian scratched his head and replied innocently, “Umm, well, just a little, a little bit.”
The Sacred Leader shook his head then. “If you just have a little bit left, then keep it for yourself.”
Shen Tian replied, “Master, I think you got me wrong there. What I mean is…”
Looking at Chen Zhongtian, who was regaining consciousness again, compassion flashed past Shen Tian’s eyes. He sighed and continued. “What I mean is, all the Nirvana Holy Liquid that I took out previously is just a little bit of what I have.”
With that, Shen Tian’s Archeon Sea Ring shimmered, and 30 bottles of Nirvana Holy Liquid flew out.
The deep fragrance emitting from the bottles condensed into a thick mist, and celestial beings’ shadows were being vaguely seen.
It was inherent that all these bottles of Nirvana Holy Liquid were as authentic as they could get!
…
Spat!
The Big Dipper’s Saint puked out a mouthful of blood. His whole body seemed to shrink in size as he leaned forward on the ground, and he looked very weak.
The Sacred Leader announced calmly, “Please, get someone to send the Big Dipper’s Saint back to the Big Dipper Sacred Ground.
“Remember to send him back while he is still alive and take note not to bump him into anything along the way. Or else we may be blamed for his injuries.”
After which, the Sacred Leader turned to Bodhisattva Kuduo and commented, “Bodhisattva, since you are here today, if the Big Dipper Sacred Ground sends anyone to reason with us about what happened, pray be our witness and help us clear our name.”
Bodhisattva Kuduo looked at the Nirvana Holy Liquid in his hands.
He then nodded resolutely, “No monk lies. I will be the witness that the Big Dipper’s Saint suffered a Qi Deviation, and his Nascent Soul was being shattered due to his own doings. It has nothing to do with the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground.”
The Sacred Leader nodded his head in satisfaction. “Bodhisattva, you are a kind and just man.”
With that, he turned back to Shen Tian.
To be honest, he felt rather complicated as he looked at his disciple now.
Although the Sacred Leader believed firmly that Shen Tian was the Son of Providence, he did not expect that Shen Tian would be that absurd to have collected so much Nirvana Holy Liquid.
When normal plant demons faced tribulation transcendence and went into Nirvana, they could at most form Nirvana Holy Liquid the volume of one or two storage spaces.
Until now, Shen Tian had already taken out Nirvana Holy Liquid, the volume of almost one storage space, and the liquid’s quality was superb.
While I do have trust that Tian’er will bring the sacred ground to great heights in the future, his providence is too simply amazing!
All this seems like a dream, and we really are progressing too fast!
Oh no, I can’t contain myself anymore—
Hahahahaha!
…
The heavenly aura on the Sacred Leader’s body surface vibrated vigorously, but he still spoke in his usual calm manner, “Tian’er is really so thoughtful. I am very pleased with your attitude.
“However, the sacred ground has its own dignity. We cannot take advantage of you.
“How about this! For these 10 Nirvana Holy Liquid bottles, I shall keep them for you at the sacred ground.
“Should any Elders require them in the future, they can exchange them with their own treasures.
“And all the items that were collected will be given to you.
“As for the three bottles of Nirvana Holy Liquid that each of us has now, we will not take them for free either.
“Let us discuss, and we will give you treasures equivalent to the Nirvana Holy Liquid’s value.”
When the Divine Firmament’s Sacred Leader finished, Heavenly Venerable White Lotus and all the other disciples at the scene had nothing but respect written all over their faces.
How great it was that they had a leader who could resist the temptation of so much free Nirvana Holy Liquid!? They were pretty sure that such leaders did not exist in the world anymore.
He was fair and just and really treated disciples as his own children—it was no wonder that the sacred ground could become stronger and stronger under his guidance!
But of course, not everyone was impressed with the Divine Firmament’s Sacred Leader’s actions.
For instance, a certain old Taoist priest felt like he could explode in pain when he heard his Junior Brother’s words.
To be very honest, he felt like he was being targeted again.
This Second Junior Brother of his was truly cunning!
Wouldn’t it be nice to just take the Nirvana Holy Liquid for free?
…
While Heavenly Venerable Azure Lotus shot several dagger-like looks at his Junior Brother, Bodhisattva Kuduo’s expression suddenly changed.
The Bodhi beads on his neck shone, and a Buddha’s shadow was seen vaguely.
Majestic and serious, this Buddha’s shadow emitted countless rays of Buddhist lights, and merits circled this figure!
It was as if a real Buddha had descended on earth, and everyone had only respect for him!
This person was none other than Sonic Thunder’s Buddhist Lord!

&nbsp;
One had to say, the Sonic Thunder’s Buddhist Lord did make quite an impressive appearance.
The illumination of his Buddhahood rank enveloped him, and a Dharmachakra[1] of cultivation merit was behind him, forming the reflection of the Buddha’s land.
The sounds of reciting Buddhist scriptures could be heard as the humongous Bodhi Tree avatar, which could even cover the sky, radiating in all directions.
Eight golden holy dragons were enveloping the Bodhi Tree; each was over 300 meters in length and looked exceptionally powerful.
According to rumors, the current Buddhist Lord had already successfully cultivated the true body of the Buddha. He was a living Buddha, one of the most powerful beings in the Eastern Wilderness.
The Buddhist Lord was best in the Great Wisdom Bodhi Wonderful Sutra, being proficient in all kinds of Buddhism principles and philosophy. He frequently visited other sacred grounds to discuss sutras and Dao with the Sacred Leaders, but it was rare for him to face defeat.
The Sonic Thunder’s Buddhist Lord was one of the two Sages with great wisdom in the Eastern Wilderness’ 12 sacred grounds. As for the other individual with great wisdom… it was none other than Divine Firmament’s Sacred Leader.
Because of that, the Buddhist Lord had paid much attention to the next Bodhisattva.
The Buddhist Lord admired Divine Firmament Sacred Ground’s Zhang Yunting. He believed Zhang Yunting’s father had influenced his wisdom and ability to cope with all matters with schemes and strategies.
The Buddhist Lord had always hoped for his disciple to be able to win against the successor of the Divine Firmament’s Sacred Leader when discussing about the Dao.
It was a pity that Bodhisattva Kuduo, who was of the same generation as Zhang Yunting, was completely a dunce—a barbaric monk without any wisdom at all.
The Buddhist Lord hoped that Bodhisattva Kuduo would be able to use Buddhism principles to win against the Dao of the Sacred Leader’s successor…
Well, it was basically impossible to achieve it, so the Buddhist Lord had also given up. Since Bodhisattva Kuduo was unable to surpass Zhang Yunting, then he should learn more from Zhang Yunting!
Thus, the Buddhist Lord had sent Bodhisattva Kuduo to the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground to become friends with Zhang Yunting.
In the end, Bodhisattva Kuduo had not gotten close with Zhang Yunting. Instead, he had associated with Fang Chang. Also, the more these two blockheads interacted, the more simple-minded they became. In turn, that led them to be more daring, and they caused trouble everywhere non-stop.
Bodhisattva Kuduo had not learned the Great Wisdom Bodhi Wonderful Sutra, which could impress and brainwash people. On the contrary, he just spent his time outside to slay demons and fiends.
One had to know that even demons and fiends had intelligence. Buddha was compassionate, so they should be given a chance to repent and become a good person.
You just go slaughtering demons and fiends every day and pull hatred for our Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground. What if those demons and fiends seek revenge?
Isn’t it much better to bring the demons and fiends back to our sacred ground, to preach to them, and increase the sacred ground’s strength?
The Buddhist Lord had wanted to tell these to Kuduo long ago but unfortunately could not do so. That was because, according to the traditions of Buddhism, such matters were irrelevant to the Buddhist scriptures.
It was something all mighty figures would need to comprehend on their own. These were the unspoken rules, so the elders were unable to intervene. They could only hint their disciples continuously for them to comprehend on their own.
Bodhisattva Kuduo, being a blockhead, could not understand the unspoken rules no matter what, which enraged the Buddhist Lord.
If it were not for Bodhisattva Kuduo holding a special, irreplaceable position in their Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground, he would have already accepted another disciple, not bothering with a fellow without the root of wisdom.
…
Buddha sounds echoed from the avatar that the Buddhist Lord had manifested; it contained great wisdom.
The Sacred Leader’s lightning and heavenly aura shone brightly, and the sound of Dao could be vaguely heard within the heavens and earth, dispersing the Buddhist Lord’s sounds.
He looked at the Buddhist Lord and spoke calmly. “Brother Tianxiu, your understanding of Buddhism has deepened increasingly.”
The Buddhist Lord revealed a knowing smile. “Thank you. My body’s like a Bodhi tree. My heart seems a mirror to be. I’d always keep them fit and clean, not to let dust onto them creep.
“I am no genius. I have yet to grasp the most profound knowledge of the Great Wisdom Bodhi Wonderful Sutra, so I dare not slack off for a moment.”
Upon hearing the Buddhist Lord’s answers, Azure Lotus’ and Whit Lotus’ facial expressions became serious.
Everyone knew that the Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground’s Great Wisdom Bodhi Wonderful Sutra was a supreme heritage. If one mastered the Great Wisdom Bodhi Wonderful Sutra, then one could comprehend 3,000 sutras thoroughly in a day, directly becoming a Buddha.
One would truly become a Buddha, physically and mentally, free of earthly worries.
In the passage of 10,000 years, none of the Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground’s Buddhist Lords could reach that realm. Thus, the difficulty of achieving that realm was self-evident.
However, the Buddha sounds accompanying the Buddhist Lord proved that he was not far from that supreme realm, just a step away.
If this step could be achieved, Buddhist Lord Tianxiu would most probably oppress the entire Eastern Wilderness’ Dao cultivation system. Thus, Buddhism would outshine Daoism.
Naturally, such a situation was definitely not what the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground or any other Dao sacred grounds were willing to see, as their core teachings were different.
Just a branched-out Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground of the West Desert Buddhism Sect was able to oppress the sacred grounds in Eastern Wilderness? The Dao sacred grounds would lose all their reputation and face!
White Lotus Mountain’s atmosphere froze as the two sacred grounds were secretly competing.
The Buddhist Lord did not regard himself as an outsider, so he smiled and said, “So how’s Martial Nephew’s injury?”
Before the Sacred Leader could answer, Fang Chang and Bodhisattva Kuduo walked toward them with large strides, their arms over each others’ shoulders.
He grinned from ear to ear and bowed to the Buddhist Lord. “Thank you for your concern, Buddhist Lord. I have completely recovered.”
The Buddhist Lord looked at Bodhisattva Kuduo, who had his arm over Fang Chang’s shoulders, and his eyes shone. “You’ve recovered?”
It shouldn’t be!
Bodhisattva Kuduo had begged the Buddhist Lord previously for the Golden Body Potion full of tears. He had even promised to the Buddhist Lord that he would read sutras properly in the future.
Although the Buddhist Lord did not believe Kuduo, he still gave him the Golden Body Potion because he knew it could not heal the Dao injury nor mend the cracked Golden Core.
Since Fang Chang could not survive for long, the Buddhist Lord did not mind being a good person and lending a helping hand.
What happened just now? Why is Kuduo with Fang Chang again? How did he recover?
Bodhisattva Kuduo seemed to want to show off to his master, so he took out his Nirvana Holy Liquid bottle.
He smiled and said, “That’s right. It was because the Divine Firmament’s Saint, Senior Brother Shen Tian, had a few thousand liters of Nirvana Holy Liquid. He shared 100L to save Fang Chang and even helped Fang Chang to reach the Golden Core Ninth Refinement Stage.”
A few thousand liters of Nirvana Holy Liquid? In that instant, the Buddhist Lord was astounded.
Isn’t the Nirvana Holy Liquid a supreme-grade healing treasure that even 250mL is difficult to obtain? So how could this unknown new Saint take out a few thousand liters?
The Buddhist Lord looked at the Sacred Leader. He was still holding his Golden Brahma Kamal Flower in his hand, but he could no longer smile.
“Dao Brother Longyuan, when did your sacred ground obtain a new Saint? Why have I not heard of him?”
The heavenly aura around the Sacred Leader started fluctuating. “Tian’er is my new disciple. His Saint coronation ceremony is going to be held one year later. The invitations will be sent out as soon as possible.”
In the cultivation world, the mighty figures would enter seclusion for half to a year, or even tens, or up to 100 years. Thus, as long as there were important ceremonies, preparations had to be done at least a year before. The preparation for the Saint’s coronation ceremony might start 100 years beforehand!
The Divine Firmament Sacred Ground was one of the 12 sacred grounds, so the Saint’s coronation ceremony had to be extravagant enough to keep the sacred ground’s reputation.
The Buddhist Lord seemed to be deep in thought. He looked at Shen Tian, who was trying to keep a low profile, and his eyes lit up.
Such an incredibly handsome man! He is really suitable to promote Buddhism!
If he could enter our sect, he would be invincible in increasing the number of believers!
He wouldn’t even need to cultivate the “Great Wisdom Bodhi Wonderful Sutra”. He just needs to be handsome enough.
When he meets those female patrons, he just needs to smile and say, “Amitabha, you are fated with the Buddha.”
Then in the whole Eastern Wilderness, the increase in the amount of loyal Buddhist believers would be tremendous. The whole sacred ground would thus become prosperous!
At that thought, the Buddhist Lord took a look at his dumb disciple, who had his arms around Fang Chang’s shoulder, and vice versa. This disciple only knew how to laugh foolishly.
The comparison rendered the Buddhist Lord speechless, and he went green with envy!
[1] The Dharma Wheel, Dharmachakra, or Wheel of Dharma, is one of Buddhism’s many sacred teachings. It is one of the most important and sacred symbols in the Buddhist faith as it represents Buddha’s teachings.


CHAPTER 177: BODHI BUDDHIST SCRIPTURE

Translator: Atlas Studios  Editor: Atlas Studios
Sonic Thunder’s Buddhist Lord looked at Shen Tian, and then at Bodhisattva Kuduo. He became even more envious the more he compared them. The more he thought about it, the greener his complexion turned.
To think that such a handsome youngster is not a monk!
Frankly speaking, if the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground was not one of the 12 sacred grounds, he would have already forced Shen Tian to join his sect.
Of course, although the Buddhist Lord was very envious, he maintained his majestic and dignified image as if he was a true Buddha!
He calmly looked at Bodhisattva Kuduo. “Kuduo, since Martial Nephew Fang Chang has already recovered, come back!”
Bodhisattva Kuduo pulled a long face. “Master, I have not seen Fang Chang in a long time. Can we stay in Divine Firmament for a few days and return later?”
The Buddhist Lord gave a knowing, compassionate smile. “You still have Buddhist sutras that you have yet to finish copying.
“Kuduo, you need to know:
‘One’s body is like a Bodhi tree; one’s heart seems a mirror to be.
Always keep them fit and clean, not to let dust onto them creep.’
“You are the Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground’s Bodhisattva. You have the responsibility of promoting Buddhism, and all the more, train oneself. You cannot slack off!
“As for reminiscing, you have ample time ahead. No need to hurry.”
Kuduo’s expression turned even gloomier upon listening to the Buddhist Lord’s nagging lecture.
“Yes, I understand!”
He turned and looked at Fang Chang with great reluctance. “Fang Chang, see you next time then.”
The Buddhist light covering the Buddhist Lord’s body fluctuated slightly. He could not stand seeing this charade, and his figure gradually disappeared. He did not want to continue looking at them.
All good disciples belong to others… What a terrible feeling. 
The rosary beads’ light gradually dispersed, and the Buddhist Lord’s figure and avatar slowly disappeared.
Only the Buddhist Lord’s voice could be vaguely heard.
“Dao Brother Longyuan, I see that your Saint’s root of wisdom is quite deep. If he’s interested, he can come to the Bodhi tree of our sect for enlightenment. He might have some gains.”
The moment the Buddhist Lord finished his sentence, everyone took in a sharp breath. That’s because the Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground’s Bodhi tree was extraordinary.
It was a supreme tree that had been transplanted from the depths of the West Desert Buddhism Sect. It was said that the Bodhi tree had supernatural powers and was among the Spiritual Wood List’s top 10.
If one sat cross-legged under the Bodhi tree, then they would receive enlightenment at a much faster rate. It could also enhance one’s speed of cultivating any cultivation technique.
According to legends, a Buddhist Lord of the Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground had stayed underneath the tree for seven days and nights, trying to attain an epiphany. In the end, he completely understood the Great Sonic Thunder Sutra and became a Buddha!
That was the Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground’s most glorious period!
From then on, the Bodhi tree became the Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground’s supreme treasure, and it was extremely respected.
Normally, only the Buddhist Lord and Bodhisattva would have the qualifications to try attaining enlightenment.
Who knew that today—the first time the Buddhist Lord encountered Shen Tian—would make such a temptatious offer!?
His admiration for Shen Tian was self-evident.
The heavenly aura around the Sacred Leader fluctuated slightly. He was evidently unhappy.
Tianxiu, ah, Tianxiu… You’re trying to poach Shen Tian right in front of me? 
Hehe, do you have a daughter?

…
Bodhisattva Kuduo was reluctant to leave, but he still bade his farewell since he would only need to copy the Buddhist sutras 1,000 times if he returned to the Sacred Ground in time.
If Sonic Thunder’s Law Enforcement Monks were to bring him back, his punishment would most probably be increased to 10,000 times.
After saying goodbye to Fang Chang, he approached Shen Tian. “Saint Shen Tian, the amount of Nirvana Holy Liquid you’ve given is too much. I will share it with my juniors and seniors in Sonic Thunder, according to what you said.
“Also, I will tell them to chant sutras and pray for your well-being. Of course, I don’t like chanting sutras, so I won’t do it.”
1
Shen Tian could not help but want to laugh with this blockhead before him.
Poor thing… He has to go back and do his homework so soon after coming in search of his friend to play with.
Shen Tian pulled Bodhisattva Kuduo to the side.
“Senior Brother Kuduo, I’ll gift you a Buddhist scripture. Recite it to your Buddhist Lord. After listening to it, he might not punish you anymore.”
Kuduo’s eyes lit up. “Really? Saint Tian, please do not deceive me.”
Shen Tian said, “Well, I’m not sure if it will definitely work.”
Kuduo replied happily, “I’ll just try it! I have nothing to lose, anyway.”
Shen Tian nodded and whispered, “But you have to guarantee that you won’t say I told you this.”
Kuduo seemed to be in a difficult position. “What if Master asks me? As a monk, I cannot lie.”
Shen Tian felt helpless and said, “Forget it then. Senior Brother, you can return and copy the sutras.”
Kuduo instantly expressed his determination. “A monk should not stick to trifles! Saint Tian, I’ll just say that I dreamed about it, how about that?”
Shen Tian smiled, feeling relieved.
Looks like he’s not that dumb!
He activated his divine consciousness and transmitted a message to Bodhisattva Kuduo. He did not dare recite it out loud.
Who knew what the Buddhist Lord’s reaction would be after listening to this Buddhist scripture? It was fine if it could enlighten him. Then, the Buddhist Lord’s cultivation level would increase, and he would consequently commend Bodhisattva Kuduo. Thus, Shen Tian would then have formed a good relationship with Kuduo.
However, what if the Buddhist Lord felt that it was heresy? Shen Tian was not going to take the blame.
Anyway, I’ve given you the Buddhist scripture. Once you leave this sacred ground, it will have nothing to do with me anymore. Be it secretly saving it for yourself or sharing it with your Buddhist Lord, it is your choice.
Within the message Shen Tian had transmitted to Bodhisattva Kuduo, he first started with the declaration of passing the buck to Bodhisattva Kuduo. Only after accepting the hundreds of words of declaration of whose responsibility it was could Bodhisattva Kuduo see the Buddhist scripture.
After he finished reading the long declaration, he was completely overwhelmed. The good thing was he had finally reached the Buddhist scripture’s part.
‘Bodhi Buddhist Scripture’
Bodhi originally has no tree,
The mirror has no stand.
Buddha nature is always clean and pure;
Where is there room for dust?
The mind is the Bodhi tree,
The body is the mirror stand.
The mirror is originally clean and pure;
Where can it be stained by dust?
Bodhi originally has no tree.
The bright mirror also has no stand.
Fundamentally there is not a single thing.
Where could dust arise?
Search out Bodhi only in the mind.
Why toil outside in search of the profound?
Just as you hear these words, so practice;
Heaven then appears, right before your eyes1.
…
Sssss!
Wonderful! This Buddhist scripture is just excellent! Too ingenious! Extraordinary!
After reading that Buddhist scripture, Kuduo felt that his mind had been baptized.
He had also read many Buddhist sutras and scriptures in the past, but he felt they were all chaotic and very awkward-sounding. Not to mention understanding the meaning, even when reading a scripture, he would become tongue-tied.
However, this Buddhist scripture that Shen Tian gave him was completely different.
Although Kuduo could not understand it at all, he could read it smoothly!
It also rhymed1!
Yeap, such a good Buddhist scripture, I must inform Master.
At that thought, Kuduo hurriedly bade everyone farewell. He had to hurry and return to Sonic Thunder and give this scripture to the Buddhist Lord.
Bodhisattva Kuduo was full of anticipation while waiting for his wish not to need to copy Buddhist sutras in the future anymore to come true.
Meanwhile, Shen Tian looked in the direction Bodhisattva Kuduo left and secretly wished him good luck.
Fortune favors fools, and this blockhead’s halo is very bright. Thus, he should be fine after giving him the Buddhist scripture since even a monster would not hurt its own offspring. Not to mention he is the Bodhisattva!
…
After Kuduo left, there were no longer any outsiders in White Lotus Mountain.
The Sacred Leader looked at Shen Tian with relief, and his heavenly aura gently rippled.
He said calmly, “Tian’er, follow me to the Sacred Leader Mountain. I want to entrust you something important.”
Entrust something important to me? What’s something important? Your daughter’s marriage?
Eh!? Why would I think in that way!?
It’s very tragic if the woman is strong, but the man is weak in a relationship!

The Divine Firmament’s Sacred Leader used his mystic art and made a portal out of thin air.
Shen Tian followed behind him, and both of them disappeared from White Lotus Mountain.
When Shen Tian opened his eyes, they were at the Sacred Leader Palace on Sacred Leader Mountain.
The Sacred Leader sat on the throne and looked at Shen Tian, his heavenly aura on the surface flickering.
Shen Tian had done great today, and even though the Sacred Leader had severed his emotions, he still felt very proud of him.
He felt especially good when he saw how Heavenly Venerable Azure Lotus reacted.
He’s the one who doubted my choice of person in the first place! Now he has missed the chance to have the Heavenly Dao’s Son as his disciple. He must be so regretful!
Cough, cough… That’s not important. I still have important stuff now.
He forced his heavenly aura to calm down and said, “I’m very pleased.
“Tian’er, not only do you have great providence, but you also have the heart to share it with others.
“I was right all this while. You are the most suitable candidate for being the Saint.”
Shen Tian scratched his head and could not understand what the Sacred Leader was trying to say.
What do you mean by that?
I’m the Saint because your daughter brought me here by force, remember? Unlike others who became your disciples and then the Saint, I’m the opposite!
I became the Saint first before you took me in as your disciple. How did it become you chose me to be the Saint?
Also, why would Master think I’m blessed by providence? I was the most unlucky guy ever just a few weeks ago!
Even now, my halo is just a green one with red spots. That’s far from the Son of Providence!
Shen Tian explained, “All thanks to Master’s teaching.”
The Sacred Leader was happier after hearing the response.
A handsome young man that is not arrogant! He is the perfect facade for the sacred ground. Lord Tianxiu, you must be so jealous now!
The Sacred Leader nodded in response. “Tian’er, you have brought us the Nirvana Holy Liquid and saved Fang Chang. Those are great contributions to the sacred ground. I’m a very fair person. What do you want as a reward? You can say it out with no hesitation.”
Shen Tian’s eyes lit up. Master is rewarding me? How can I just take it!
He thought for a moment and said, “Master, can I have some Immortal Metal? If Immortal Metal is not available, I’m fine with Mystic Earth too. I’m not very picky.”
The lightning and heavenly aura surrounding the Sacred Leader started to flicker again. The bold request made him feel very helpless. All the items on the extraordinary list were very precious. These were treasures that cultivators could only obtain by luck.
Although the Nirvana Holy Liquid was precious, too, it was merely a consumable item. There was no comparison with extraordinary items.
Of course, if the Sacred Leader had the Immortal Metal or Mystic Earth, he would be more than willing to give them to Shen Tian.
However, he did not have any of them.
The truth was that when the sacred ground obtained these extraordinary items, the items would be used by the talented geniuses straight away.
Although a Grand Elder had some Mystic Earth with him, there was no way for the Sacred Leader to go against his own family for that treasure!
The Sacred Leader looked at Shen Tian, feeling very helpless. He knew that these were the items Shen Tian needed to complete the set of Five Elements extraordinary items.
As his master, he felt very embarrassed for not being able to help his disciple.
Why isn’t it fire that Tian’er needs…
If he needs fire, I can just trick Heavenly Venerable Azure Lotus for it! I just need some Azure Green Sky Flame Origin to solve the issue!
The Sacred Leader calmed himself down and coughed. “Erm, I’ll give them to you once they are available.”
Shen Tian had a high EQ—’once they are available’ meant that his master did not have them for now.
Shen Tian decided not to give his master a hard time and said, “I shall thank Master in advance!”
The Sacred Leader felt his cheeks were burning with embarrassment, “Is there anything you want? I’ll provide whatever I can!”
Indeed, there was nothing the Sacred Leader was reluctant to give Shen Tian after believing he was the Heavenly Dao’s Son.
He was even prepared to marry his daughter to him and hand him the sacred ground. An extraordinary item was really nothing compared to that!
However, as the sacred ground’s Sacred Leader, he felt bad for not being able to give merit to his disciple!
Shen Tian thought for a moment and felt that his self-protection methods were not strong enough—he needed some upgrade.
Thus, he took out his Sword Master Token and showed it to the Sacred Leader.
“Master, this is the Sword Master Token made by Sword Venerable Long River, Li Canglan. It is really useful. May I know if there’s anything similar to this in our sacred ground? I don’t mind paying for it.”
The Sacred Leader took a look at it and said calmly, “Although this Sword Master Token is well crafted, the attack it unleashes is too weak. I can seal three moves into your Saint Token, but each move can only be utilized once. Using external help too often is not good for you anyway.”
Shen Tian was very happy to hear that. “Thank you, Master! How strong are these three attacks?”
“No one below the Saint realm can survive these.”
Wow, that sounds good! That’s so strong! I like it!
Although it cannot be used repeatedly, like the Sword Master Token, it’s much more useful!
The Sword Master Token was literally useless when the opponents were too strong. But the three moves sealed in the Saint Token were like a nuclear weapon! Even Soul Formation cultivators were no match for it!
Seems like I made a wise choice coming to the sacred ground!
The Saint’s Token flew out of Shen Tian’s pocket and landed on the Sacred Leader’s hand. The lightning and heavenly aura around him became a golden light and dived into the token.
As more of this golden light gushed into the Saint Token, three emblems appeared on it. There was a mysterious feeling about the emblems, and they looked extremely powerful.
The light slowly dimmed, and the token flew back to Shen Tian’s hand. It felt slightly heavier.
The lightning and heavenly aura seemed much thinner. Obviously, the Sacred Leader had spent great effort to help Shen Tian.
Shen Tian quickly took a Nirvana Holy Liquid bottle out of his Archeon Sea Ring and said, “Master has used so much power just to help me, I feel bad. I hope you can have this Nirvana Holy Liquid to replenish your strength. I cannot have a peaceful sleep if Master refuses.”
The Sacred Leader felt slightly touched and said, “Don’t be silly. There is no need for that. You have given enough holy liquid to the sacred ground. Keep this for yourself!
“Actually, I have an important thing I need to discuss with you today.”
Shen Tian had just gotten the reward from his master, so he replied without hesitation, “Master, I’ll do whatever you ask me to do.”
The Sacred Leader said calmly, “After ten days, the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground and the Jade Lake Sacred Ground will be having a joint training.
“The location of the joint training is the Primordial Battlefield near the Country of Fire. All the cultivators participating will be below the Golden Core stage. Thus, Fang Chang, Yunting, and Yunxi cannot participate.
“Tian’er, I hope you can lead the disciples and perform well in the joint training. It doesn’t matter to me how many fortuitous opportunities you guys manage to encounter. All I care about is the disciples’ safety.”
The Sacred Leader looked at Shen Tian and said solemnly, “I’ll leave those disciples in your hands.”
Shen Tian felt that he had been tricked into this troublesome situation.
Primordial Battlefield? The one created by the evil cultivators from outside the country?
It was said that even Perfected Immortals had been involved in the battle.
After the intense battle, the Primordial Battlefield was formed.
Many bold cultivators would enter the battlefield and tried to find fortuitous opportunities for themselves.
In the end, no one ever returned. All of them became nutrients for that area.
…
Shen Tian felt that something would go terribly wrong if he led the disciples there.
My halo is just a green one with red spots. It’s not safe at all!
Also, can’t the joint training be at a safer place?
I think the Mirror Moon Lake near the sacred ground is good!
Why don’t we go there instead?
Can we not go to that dreadful place?
Honestly, after encountering the Fog Plain incident, Shen Tian had decided to be extra cautious.
He only had one life, and he could not afford to risk it like the cultivators with great providence. If he tried to mimic them, he would simply just lose his life!
Thus, Shen Tian really wanted to tell the truth to his master.
Master, I can’t! I’m really not the Son of Providence!

At Eastern Wilderness’ Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground, Little Spirit Mountain Boundary…
Buddhist light shone radiantly at the paradise the Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground had created.
At the spatial door, which was the sacred ground’s entrance, was a Seven Treasure Glazed Buddha Mirror. This mirror was inlaid with Purple Gold, Snow Silver, Azure Stone, Water Essence, Giant Clam, Coral, and Agate.
These were Sonic Thunder’s seven treasures. They were all supreme-grade as compared to other precious treasures of the same type, and they were enhanced by Sonic Thunder’s Holy Monks.
The Buddhist light would shine onto anyone that entered the door, and they would be able to forget all their troubles and have a calm mind, free of worries.
The light of this Glazed Buddha Mirror could reach even 100 kilometers away, covering half of the sky.
At the foot of the mountain in the distance were devout Buddhist believers. They were the most fanatic ascetic believers that had arrived at the sect after walking for tens of thousands of kilometers.
Among those people, there was no lack of cultivators who were quite powerful and could use Sword Kinesis Flight.
However, to express one’s devoutness, they walked from tens of thousands of kilometers away and kowtowed with every three steps.
This was the Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground. It belonged to one of the top supreme sacred grounds, even amongst Eastern Wilderness’ 12 sacred grounds.
It had the West Desert Buddhism Sect, which had immeasurable resources and manpower.
…
Near the Little Spirit Mountain Boundary, at the Sonic Thunder Buddhism City’s teleportation circle, Buddhist light shone from the void, brightly.
800 Arhats and other guardians appeared from within the light.
Sanskrit sounds came out of nowhere as if the Buddha was chanting sutras to redeem the world.
Then, the wooden fish started to play, and a white-robed robe appeared out of nowhere. He sat with his legs crossed, and there was a giant Divine Bodhi Tree avatar behind him.
The young monk was so outstanding that he attracted everyone’s attention.
That’s right—the exact same avatar, which did not change at all.
This white-robed monk was Bodhisattva Kuduo—he had activated the special effects once again.
However, the moment he appeared, believers instantly knelt down at the teleportation circle. They were praying softly, and their eyes were filled with craze. It was obvious that they were extremely devout.
Bodhisattva Kuduo seemed to have already been used to such a scene. He sighed helplessly and gradually left with the special effects still activated.
Shortly after he left, those believers also dispersed and gathered at a hidden alley. A bald person wearing a hat was waiting there.
“Your acting is not bad.”
He held a bag of Spirit Stones and split them with everyone, one by one.
“Kongde, Kongyun, Kongse, the three of you have done well. Tomorrow, go and collect the high-level Secular Disciple token, then start the pilgrimage act. I have high expectations for you, so continue to work hard. Then, you’ll have the qualifications to shave in the near future.
“As for the others, your act was either a little too perfunctory or too exaggerated. You still need to practice more.”
The three young believers that had received more Spirit Stones were elated.
“Thank you, Master. We will definitely continue to work hard so we can shave and become monks earlier!”
…
Bodhisattva Kuduo did not know what was happening in that small alley. He had already reached the Little Spirit Mountain Boundary’s entrance and went inside.
The scenery instantly changed, and Bodhisattva Kuduo appeared within a Bodhimanda filled with immeasurable light.
This Small World was different from the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground, which was filled with exotic flowers and rare herbs, clouds and rainbows. Instead, it was extremely extravagant and resplendent.
Bodhisattva Kuduo appeared before a magnificent staircase that reached the clouds. The stairs were a thousand feet wide. What was more astonishing was that the stairs were paved with gold and emitted immeasurable light.
Beside the stairs were other palaces, pavilions, treasure ponds, and a pagoda.
Those buildings were all embellished with the seven treasures—they were extremely dignified and did not need the sun or moon to shine brightly.
This was an extremely fragrant paradise as everything that could be seen was made with Infinitude Treasured Incense.
One would revel in the smell, which filled the whole world, while heavenly songs came wafted from the skies. What they heard would differ according to what they craved.
Bodhisattva Kuduo walked up the stairs toward the sky.
This was the Clear Conscience Stairs, and it used the Infinitude Gold to test if the believer’s heart was firm.
The sacred ground would choose fated people every few years to walk the stairs.
If one’s belief was firm and devout and had a selfless mind, they would have a chance to enter the sacred ground.
If one did not have a selfless mind or the aptitude for enlightenment, it meant they were not fated with the Buddha.
Of course, Bodhisattva Kuduo also did not know how he had finished walking the golden stairs in the past and came to the Sonic Thunder Temple.
It was like the Buddha had protected him as he did not feel any pressure at all. It had been so smooth that even he could not believe it.
Oh, my Buddha! At first, he had just wanted to try his luck and enter the sacred ground to scrape a living!
Presently, he was on pins and needles as he quickly finished walking the 10,000 golden steps.
Soon, an extremely vast and dignified palace appeared at the end of the steps, floating on the top of the clouds.
A humongous golden lotus flower, which was 100,000 feet in size beneath the palace, bloomed fully with twelve petals. That lotus flower was surrounded by endless Buddhist light and filled with the aura of merit. The whole palace shined brightly.
Meanwhile, on the beams of the majestic palace, which was hundreds of thousands of feet tall, was a tablet hung—Grand Treasure Hall!
Bodhisattva Kuduo was anxious, with a long face, as he walked toward the Grand Treasure Hall slowly.
Just as Kuduo was about to enter the Grand Treasure Hall, a voice resounded. “Bathe.”
Kuduo’s body trembled slightly, and he looked at the Seven Treasure Pond to the Grand Treasure Hall’s left.
This pond was embellished with the seven treasures and filled with Eight Merit Water. It was the supreme treasure to cleanse one’s mind and heart of the Buddhist sect.
Everyone had to cleanse their whole body using the Eight Merit Water in the Seven Treasure Pond before meeting the Buddhist Lord.
In fact, this was a custom that Kuduo disliked as he still had to bathe before meeting his Master!
However, no matter how much he disliked it, Kuduo still did not dare to disobey his Master. He could only go and bathe himself thoroughly.
After bathing and changing clothes, Kuduo took a deep breath and walked into the Grand Treasure Hall.
In the Grand Treasure Hall’s center was a huge golden Buddha, hundreds of feet tall, sitting cross-legged.
Kuduo slowly walked to the center of the hall and obediently bowed. He said, “Master, I have returned.”
The huge golden Buddha opened his eyes, with a Golden Brahma Kamal Flower in his hands, smiled, and said, “How much do you know about the Divine Firmament’s Saint?”
Kuduo was stunned. “I met him for the first time, so I do not know much about him.”
The huge golden Buddha’s smile gradually disappeared. “Never mind. Go and copy the Buddhist scriptures!”
Kuduo became even more sorrowful. He was hesitating whether or not he should speak.
In the end, he still opened his mouth and said, “Master, I-I have something to say.”
The huge golden Buddha said calmly, “Copy the Great Wisdom Bodhi Wonderful Sutra 1,000 times. Tell me after you finish copying.”
Kuduo’s eyes turned red. “Master, what I want to say is related to the Great Wisdom Bodhi Wonderful Sutra.”
The huge golden Buddha stared straight at Kuduo. “Oh, is it possible you have some understanding of this supreme art?”
Kuduo braced himself to continue. “Yes, I have a Buddhist scripture to present.”
As he spoke, Kuduo read the Bodhi Buddhist Scripture aloud in front of the huge golden Buddha.
…
After he finished reciting the whole Buddhist scripture, the whole Grand Treasure Hall instantly turned silent.
Immediately after, a blinding light exploded from within the huge golden Buddha. “How dare you! You actually tampered with the true meaning of our Buddhist scripture so that you wouldn’t need to copy the Buddhist scriptures.
“I punish you to face the wall for three months and copy the Great Wisdom Bodhi Wonderful Sutra 10,000 times!
“If you don’t finish copying, then you’re not allowed to find Fang Chang!”

Copy the Great Wisdom Bodhi Wonderful Sutra 10,000 times!?
Upon hearing Lord Tianxiu’s words, cold sweat broke out on Bodhisattva Kuduo’s forehead!
Copy such a thick scripture 10,000 times? My hands will die from all the copying!
At that thought, Kuduo hurriedly said, “Forgive me, Master. I didn’t write this Buddhist scripture.”
The huge golden Buddha holding the Golden Brahma Kamal Flower replied coldly, “I know. It’s impossible for you to write a Buddhist scripture that rhymes.
“Hurry and tell me who created this scripture. It’s simply beyond the pale and twisting Buddha’s true meaning!”
Kuduo said, “This… is something I heard from someone when I was sleeping.”
The Buddhist Lord stared at Kuduo. “Who did you hear it from when you were sleeping?”
Kuduo was stunned. How should he reply?
The Buddhist Lord continued asking, “Why are you hesitating? Was it Fang Chang?
“You heard it from him when you were sleeping… Why? Have you slept with him on the same bed before?”
Kuduo said helplessly, “Master, you’ve misunderstood me. I meant I heard someone reciting it in my dream.”
The Buddhist Lord seemed to be deep in thought. “You’re right. You and Fang Chang are on the same level. He would not be able to write such a Buddhist scripture.”
Immediately after, the Buddhist Lord stared straight at Kuduo. “Tell me, who created this scripture?”
Kuduo’s expression turned more anxious. “Master, I swore that I could not reveal it.”
The Buddhist Lord gave a knowing smile. “Was it an elder or disciple of our sacred ground?”
Before Kuduo could reply, he heard the Buddhist Lord say, “No.”
The Buddhist Lord then stared at Kuduo again and asked, “Was it someone from another sacred ground? Which sacred ground? True Martial? Shu Shan? Grand Primordium? Zenith Heaven? Jade Lake? Divine Firmament?”
The smile on the Buddhist Lord’s face seemed to be filled with wisdom upon noticing that Kuduo’s expression changed slightly.
“As expected! It must be the Divine Firmament’s Sacred Leader that gave you this Buddhist scripture! He did study Buddhism before and is proficient in it.”
“Eh? It’s actually not the Divine Firmament’s Sacred Leader? It can’t be Zhang Yunting, right?”
Kuduo was confused and worried as he looked at the Buddhist Lord, who was talking to himself.
Kuduo was not worried about the Buddhist Lord going crazy, but the fact that his Master’s guess was actually getting closer and closer to the correct answer!
Senior Brother Shen, I really did not say anything. It’s Master that seems to be proficient in our sect’s mind-reading art.
“It’s not Zhang Yunting? Not Fang Chang either? It can’t be… Is it Zhang Yunxi, or… Shen Tian!”
That extraordinary good-looking face appeared in the Buddhist Lord’s mind, and he fixed his gaze onto Kuduo’s expression.
Hmph, this blockhead disciple can’t hide anything. He shows everything on his face.
The Buddhist Lord sighed. “So the Divine Firmament’s Saint gave it to you.”
Kuduo started doubting himself.
Senior Brother, if I say I did not let out the secret, will you believe me?
He pleaded for mercy and said, “Master, the Divine Firmament’s Saint is not our sect’s disciple, and this was just a dream. I dreamed of the Divine Firmament’s Saint, so this had nothing to do with him. Master, if you want to punish someone, punish me—”
Before Kuduo could finish, the Buddhist Lord interrupted him. “Shen Tian has a heavenly appearance as if he’s a Perfected Immortal that descended in our world.
“He was also able to easily obtain thousands of liters of the Nirvana Holy Liquid. It is obvious that he is blessed by immeasurable providence—he is the destined main lead.
“Since such a person created this Buddhist scripture, is it possible that he has some sort of understanding of the Great Wisdom Bodhi Wonderful Sutra?”
Fundamentally there is not a single thing.
Where could dust arise?
…
Fundamentally there is not a single thing.
Where could dust arise?
“Amitabha! After reading this scripture in more detail, it seems to make sense.
“Fundamentally there is not a single thing… Tssss, ingenious, it really is ingenious!”
The huge golden Buddha’s expression was sometimes elated, sometimes sorrowful, and sometimes crazy. The Buddhist Lord had evidently received some kind of profound enlightenment due to this Buddhist scripture.
However, the tenet within this Buddhist scripture was conflicting with his own tenet of Buddhism.
The Buddhist Lord was in a conflict—he was having a dialectical debate within himself of the Bodhi’s true meaning!
Kuduo was slightly panicking the more he observed his Master’s ever-changing expression. “Master, this Buddhist scripture… Is it really ingenious?” he whispered.
The Buddhist Lord replied, “Yes, Shen Tian has great wisdom! He has yet to read the Great Wisdom Bodhi Wonderful Sutra, but from just listening to the new Buddhist scripture he wrote, I can see his nature and understand his heart.
“Even I have been inspired by it. If he joins our Buddhist sect, he will definitely become a peerless Holy Monk. Sigh… Why did he have to join the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground?”
Kuduo looked at the huge golden Buddha, which was full of disappointment, and whispered, “Master, this is all a dream, a dream that I had.”
The huge golden Buddha looked at Kuduo coldly. He gradually stretched out his golden palm, which was ten feet in length, grabbed him, and lifted him up.
Immediately after, the other palm grabbed a small wooden mallet and heavily hit Kuduo’s head thrice.
Kuduo held his head and said in surprise, “Master, are you transmitting an art to me through hitting me thrice?”
Buddhist Lord Tianxiu replied coldly, “I am hitting your wooden fish head[1]!
“You haven’t learned any Buddhism principles, but you’ve learned how to lie. You’re even trying to deceive me?
“Since young, I have traveled the world and encountered all kinds of people. I am endowed with high intelligence, so did you really think you could deceive me?
“A dream you had? Read more Buddhist scriptures daily to increase your intelligence and reduce your interactions with Fang Chang. The more you mingle with him, the lower your comprehension ability gets.
“Shen Tian has created such an astonishing Buddhist scripture, but you can’t understand it at all and still ask me if it really is ingenious?
“Shouldn’t you go back and have a thorough apprehension by yourself later? Why did I accept such a blockhead like you as the sacred ground’s Bodhisattva?
“Leave! Face the wall for three months and copy the Great Wisdom Bodhi Wonderful Sutra.”
The Kuduo pulled a long face. “Isn’t it ingenious? Why do I still have to copy?”
The Buddhist Lord held the mallet. “If you can say which part is ingenious, then you don’t need to copy anymore.”
Kuduo broke out in cold sweat upon seeing the wooden mallet in the Buddhist Lord’s hands growing larger in size. “Master! Please have mercy!”
The Buddhist Lord grabbed Kuduo and directly threw him out of the Grand Treasure Hall.
“Scram and go face the wall, you blockhead!”
…
After throwing Kuduo out of the Grand Treasure Hall, the Buddhist Lord finally felt relieved.
The world is so beautiful, but I am so irascible. This is not good, not good!
After circulating the Bodhi Wonderful Sutra for a few cycles, the aura surrounding the Buddhist Lord calmed down once again.
However, a slightly green glimmer was still visible in the air, not reverting to its original color.
The Buddhist Lord sat crossed-legged and mumbled nonstop.
“One’s body is like a Bodhi tree?
Bodhi originally has no tree?
“Which is correct, and which is wrong?
“Should I keep away from vanity and dirt, or let go of my obsession and just leave everything to fate?
“Buddha nature is always clean and pure;
Where is there room for dust?
The mirror is originally clean and pure;
Where can it be stained by dust?
“What does clean and pure mean? What is dust referring to? Is it possible that I’ve already completely gone astray from Buddhism’s supreme path?
“Persisting in practicing Buddhism and abandoning human nature, is it also an obsession? Is it possible that the real Bodhi Dao is to be like Kuduo?”
…
The Golden Brahma Kamal Flower being pinched between the Buddhist Lord’s fingers was withering petal by petal, while the Infinitude Avatar behind him was also falling apart.
Life and death, two auras—holy and demonic—were constantly created, destroyed, and reincarnated on the surface of the Buddhist Lord’s body.
Before the Grand Treasure Hall’s doors gradually closed, the Buddhist Lord’s voice resounded.
“From today onward, I’ll be in seclusion to meditate. I will not come out before proving Bodhi!
“Also, give the Sonic Thunder’s Buddhist Token to the Divine Firmament’s Saint, Shen Tian!
“The whole sacred ground will need to treat him with respect and courtesy!”
[1] Meant as a pun as monks use mallets to strike the wooden fish, but in this case, “wooden fish head” has another meaning which means blockhead


CHAPTER 181: LONGYUAN’S FIVE ELEMENT DIVINE ARMOR

Translator: Atlas Studios  Editor: Atlas Studios
The Buddhist Lord’s declaration before entering seclusion astounded everyone in the entire Sonic Thunder Sacred Ground. Shen Tian, who was the center of the attention, did not know about it at all.
Presently, he was thinking of what excuse to use to prevent joining the Primordial Battlefield’s Trial as he knew his luck was bad, and it was extremely dangerous to go there.
If he still rashly pushed himself to go under such a situation, he could easily die.
However, as the Divine Firmament’s Saint, it was unsuitable to reject bringing Divine Firmament’s disciples to the trial. It was something the Sacred Leader requested personally, so if he directly refused, the Sacred Leader might stack the deck against him in the future!
How about I use the excuse of receiving internal injuries when I was in the Fog Plain? Should I say I’m still recovering, and it will be inconvenient to go?
The problem was that this excuse was too ridiculous as he had just shown off a few thousand liters of Nirvana Holy Liquid an hour ago. Given that astounding amount of Nirvana Holy Liquid, it would be easy for him to recover even if his four limbs were chopped off!
How about breaking through to the Golden Core stage first in the next 10 days?
That’s unsuitable too as it’s as unnatural as suddenly mentioning to break up on 19th May1.
2
Not to mention the Primordial Battlefield only restricted one’s cultivation level to be under the Golden Core stage—it was not that only Foundation Establishment cultivators could enter.
For an excuse that might not necessarily succeed, he would be risking his cultivation foundation. Hence, Shen Tian felt that it was not worthwhile.
Shen Tian said reluctantly, “Master, I just entered the sacred ground. My reputation and prestige are still lacking. I’m afraid that if I am to lead all the Junior and Senior Brothers/Sisters for the trial, it will most likely be difficult for them to accept it!”
The Divine Firmament’s Sacred Leader replied calmly, “Who dares to refuse to comply? You are the Saint.
“Junior Sister Golden Lotus has been making the Yin-Yang Lightning Explosion Talismans at full speed these days.
“Tomorrow, I will announce a 30% discount on the price of the Lightning Talismans and say that it was all due to you.
“Then, the Foundation Establishment disciples will all have the Lightning Explosion Talismans to protect them. Thus, they will be much safer during the trial. Naturally, they will be grateful to you.”
Speaking till here, the heavenly aura around the Sacred Leader slightly rippled. “Tian’er, I believe in you. This trial is also a chance. I hope you can truly build your prestige. In the future, you still need to bring this huge sacred ground to prosperity!”
After listening to the Sacred Leader’s plans, with the tone of a veteran, Shen Tian had no other choice.
The sacred ground has to develop, so I’m giving you some responsibility? What is this deja vu feeling?
Master, as the Hokage… Oh no, as the Sacred Leader, shouldn’t you choose someone according to one’s strength, reputation, or leadership abilities?
1
I just entered the sacred ground for a few days! Why do you already want to increase my responsibilities?
Such bias! Do you really not plan to consider your son’s feelings? Senior Brother Yunting is your biological son—blood is thicker than water!
Shen Tian felt resigned as he said, “However, the Primordial Battlefield is full of dangers, I am fearful. I have no experience, so if we encounter dangers, it’s fine if I die, as it’s just me losing my life.
“I’m afraid that other juniors and seniors might perish due to my mistake. Even if I died, I would be too ashamed to face them!”
The heavenly aura around the Sacred Leader fluctuated even more strongly—he never thought that Shen Tian’s sense of belonging to the sacred ground was this deep.
It was really Divine Firmament’s luck to be able to have such a disciple!
The Sacred Leader said, “You don’t need to worry about this at all. I have once calculated that you have the destiny of rising up to great heights. You are blessed by providence. You have now soared to greater heights, and according to your fate, you will be protected by the Heavenly Dao no matter where you go and turn calamities into blessings.
“Thus, the safest course of action for everyone will be to follow you during this trial. If you encounter dangers, I want you to keep yourself safe first.
“Since one’s life and death are decreed by fate, every cultivator is already prepared from when they started walking the path of cultivation.
“I know you’re kind and compassionate, but everyone has different destinies. As a higher-up, you should have the heart of a superior. Blindly pitying or helping might not be advantageous to the sacred ground’s development.”
…
The Sacred Leader’s educational lesson made Shen Tian so confused he wanted to sleep.
He only wanted to ride on the coattail of those blessed by providence by sharing their fortuitous opportunities, then keep a low profile until he achieved Immortal Ascension.
Frankly speaking, things such as becoming the Sacred Leader to lead the sacred ground to prosperity, Shen Tian was really not interested. It was just too mentally taxing!
What is more important is the destiny of rising up to great heights? I have now soared to greater heights, and according to my fate, I will be protected by the Heavenly Dao?
You sure that you’re talking about me and not Zhao Hao, who has a Master that just died?
Seeing that Shen Tian was not really interested, the Sacred Leader’s heavenly aura rippled.
Suddenly, an image flashed in his mind—a pale blue battle armor.
A bright idea struck the Sacred Leader. “Tian’er, you’ve become much more powerful now, so you should change your battle armor. How about this, if you agree to lead the disciples in this trial, I’ll give you a set of new battle armor. What do you think?”
Although Shen Tian was completely calm and composed, he wanted to laugh.
Why? Did Master rear turtles in the past?
Giving me the Black Tortoise Shield when I just entered the sacred ground, then gifting me the Black Tortoise Helmet when I invented electrolysis… Now that you need me, you plan to give me another set of Black Tortoise Armor?
Of course, Shen Tian only complained in his heart. He was still declining on the surface.
“Master, I definitely do not have such a motive. It’s my duty to contribute to our sacred ground—”
Before Shen Tian finished, he saw that a golden battle armor flew out of the Sacred Leader’s lightning and heavenly aura. It was shining with incomparable radiance. This battle armor looked relatively impressive as it was surrounded by five-colored lightning, which included white, green, black, red, and yellow. Golden lightning was then created.
On this set of battle armor, the appearance of the five divine beasts’ avatars—Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Crimson Phoenix, Black Tortoise, and Mighty Qilin—could be seen clearly.
The design on the battle armor’s helmet was a golden Qilin, quite similar to the appearance of the Qilin avatar.
The left armguard was like a dragon’s back, and golden dragon scales covered the whole arm.
The right armguard was like tiger stripes, and the gloves were inlaid with knuckles as if they were the fangs of a ferocious tiger.
The combat boots were made by scarlet gold Divine Gold—the design was a Crimson Phoenix burning the sky, extraordinarily gorgeous.
Meanwhile, right in the breastplate’s center, it was no longer the shape of a turtle shell, but a gold Yin-Yang Eight Trigrams, mysterious and unfathomable.
If the previous Black Tortoise Shield, Black Tortoise Helmet, and the new set of armor were put into a certain game as skin, then the Black Tortoise Shield and Black Tortoise Helmet would be gifted in the first recharge.
If it really did not work out, then it would be given as a reward for events.
Meanwhile, this whole new battle armor was something that a player would be willing to spend money to buy, even if one had to eat cup noodles for an entire month.
That’s right—Shen Tian, who had been tortured by the appearance of his equipment for so long, was moved.
Shen Tian rubbed his hands together. “Master, how powerful are the defensive powers of this set of battle armor? I still have quite the amount of Nirvana Holy Liquid. Can I use Nirvana Holy Liquid in exchange for this battle armor?”
The heavenly aura around the Sacred Leader slightly rippled. “This battle armor is named ‘Longyuan Divine Armor’ and is most suitable for those with the Yang Divine Lightning Constitution.
“Tian’er, if you wear this set of Divine Armor and activate its defense at full strength, it will be difficult for those below the Soul Formation stage to injure you. At the same time, your battle strength will increase by leaps and bounds.”
There was one more point that the Sacred Leader did not mention—this battle armor was the most handsome and coolest set in the whole Divine Firmament Sacred Ground.
He did not even need to remind Shen Tian as he knew that the last point was the most attractive to Shen Tian.
Young talents such as Shen Tian wanted to show off their most impressive techniques, so unless it was a situation that did not allow it, who wouldn’t want to wear the most handsome battle armor to enhance the desired effect?
He, Zhang Longyuan, was also once the most handsome man in the whole Eastern Wilderness when he was young!
The Sacred Leader firmly believed that Shen Tian, who was still young, would definitely be unable to reject such a temptation.
Indeed, after knowing that he could not exchange for this set of battle armor using Nirvana Holy Liquid, Shen Tian’s expression instantly turned resolute.
He said righteously, “Master, as the Saint of the Divine Firmament, I am obliged to take up the responsibility of a leader.
“I am willing to set a good example for my Junior and Senior Brothers/Sisters and lead them in the trial 10 days later.
“I’ll improve the prestige of Divine Firmament and definitely will not let you down!
“Of course, this has nothing to do with something like the battle armor!”
…
Never mind, I’ll just go for the trial. At most, I’ll just stay at the outer boundaries and control everyone from afar. I don’t believe that accidents can still happen like this!
That’s right. I think there was quite the good fortuitous opportunity in the Big Dipper Saint’s halo. It is relatively useful.
Before the trial begins, let’s go and reap the Big Dipper Saint’s benefits first!
Shen Tian wanted to test if stealing others’ providence would really result in a calamity for the person!

Since he’s not one of us, there’s no problem!

Chapter 182: Shen Tian, Hit Me With All Your Might!
The Sacred Leader was relieved upon hearing that Shen Tian was willing to lead the disciples.
To be honest, the reward for just leading the disciples was definitely not worth the Longyuan Divine Armor. The reason the Sacred Leader had directly used the Longyuan Divine Armor as a reward was to express his sincerity!
Ever since he and Sonic Thunder’s Tianxiu had become the Sacred Leader and Buddhist Lord, respectively, they had been secretly competing with each other for hundreds of years. They were opponents but also soulmates—once the other person’s aura fluctuated, they could guess what the other person was up to.
‘Tianxiu, this bastard. It’s obvious he has taken a liking to my lovely disciple. He must want to secretly let him become a monk, right?
Don’t even think about it! I have directly given a set of Sage battle armor to convince him to stay! I’m that generous!
At that thought, the Sacred Leader’s aura started to ripple.
He said calmly, “Tian’er, the grade of this battle armor is too high. Force out a drop of blood. I’ll personally help you to make it recognize you as its master.”
Shen Tian hurriedly nodded. He recalled that previously when his cultivation level was too low, he had squeezed out a large bowl of blood before being able to barely make the Sword Master Token recognize him as its master.
That made him feel weak from the loss of too much blood for quite a while.
The Longyuan Divine Armor in front of him was a true Divine artifact, way superior to a Spirit artifact.
If he had to do it himself again, he would most likely not succeed even if he became anemic.
Shen Tian followed the Sacred Leader’s instructions and forced out a drop of blood.
The Sacred Leader took that drop of blood and injected it into the Longyuan Divine Armor.
Subsequently, thick lightning and heavenly aura surged toward that Longyuan Divine Armor, cleansing and refining it.
The mark on the divine armor belonging to the Sacred Leader was soon dispersed and converted to a mark belonging to Shen Tian.
Meanwhile, Shen Tian could also clearly sense that some kind of connection between him and that set of Divine armor was formed.
With just a thought, that radiant golden divine armor instantly dismantled.
Next, each part of the armor flew toward Shen Tian, and in an instant, that set of battle armor completely covered Shen Tian.
An unprecedented surge of energy was poured into Shen Tian—that was the power of lightning.
The Longyuan Divine Armor was the Sacred Leader’s battle armor when he was young. Originally, it was an armor that was created specifically for the Yang Divine Lightning Constitution. Only the most supreme-grade Spirit Gold of the five types of metals, corresponding to the five elements, was used.
A high-level enhancement array was carved within the battle armor, which could strengthen one’s battle power.
Shen Tian’s strength instantly increased greatly after wearing the battle armor.
Of course, the increase in his strength was secondary. The most important thing was it was cool!
The instant Shen Tian wore the golden divine armor, he radiated bright flashes of Mixed Lightning.
The rustle of the mantle as white as snow landing onto him from his shoulder down perfectly defined what a chic appearance was!
Seeing the young man in front of him,
The Sacred Leader observed the young man before him and revealed an expression of amazement underneath the heavenly aura. Shen Tian’s looks mesmerized him for a moment.
Such a handsome young man! Tian’er exudes peerless valor in this set of battle armor.
His charm is able to mesmerize all the Saintessed in Eastern Wilderness!
Tian’er’s appearance is on par with mine! He is worthy of this divine armor!
The Sacred Leader said calmly, “Tian’er, how do you feel? Is this battle armor to your liking?”
Shen Tian nodded. “Thank you, Master. This battle armor is extremely powerful. I feel like I’m filled to the brim with strength!”
Shen Tian formed a small water mirror and was satisfied as he looked at himself in it. His whole body was covered by the golden divine armor, only exposing his handsome face.
Shen Tian’s previous problem of conflict between appearance and power had been resolved.
Indeed, equipment that could not balance good looks and practicability was because not enough money was spent!
What do you mean the Black Tortoise Shield’s and Black Tortoise Helmet’s appearance could not be improved? Look at this Longyuan Divine Armor.
This golden Tai Chi diagram on the breastplate is quite cool! A Divine artifact is indeed a Divine artifact. I must give a thumbs-up!
The Sacred Leader said, “Tian’er, do you want to test out its power? Come and attack me.”
After finishing, a golden barrier made of heavenly aura appeared in front of the Sacred Leader.
Shen Tian nodded and gradually stretched out his right hand.
Golden Mixed Divine Lightning jumped around on Shen Tian’s fingers continuously. This Mixed Divine Lightning quickly gathered to form a huge Lightning Fist the size of a person’s head.
The Lightning Fist was then rapidly compressed. When it was compressed to the longan fruit’s size, it shot out at full speed like a laser.
Boom!
The lightning, which was only the size of a longan fruit, exploded with fearsome power.
The heavenly aura barrier was crazily trembling, and cracks appeared.
The Sacred Leader nodded.
“This attack could kill a Golden Core cultivator. Given your cultivation level, you’re quite good to be able to control the Lightning Fist to such a precise degree. However, from what I see, this isn’t Tian’er’s limit! Come, use your full strength!”
Shen Tian was astonished.
I’ve already done my best to show that I was serious and had already exerted all my strength. But Master still saw through my action of not exerting my full strength, amazing!
Master is indeed Master. Looks like I have to give it my all!
…
Shen Tian clenched his fists. While wearing the Longyuan Divine Armor, he did the horse stance steadily. The golden lightning mark between his brows resonated with the Divine armor.
“Understood, Master!”
Shen Tian’s whole body started burning with a golden aura flame. His vigor and lightning burned simultaneously, converting to the purest power.
The lightning and heavenly aura around the Sacred Leader started fluctuating vigorously—he was astonished!
Wth? Is this aura really something that a Foundation Establishment cultivator could have?
Even if he is dual-cultivating his Qi and body, has the Mixed Divine Lightning, or has the Yang Divine Lightning Constitution, it’s simply too astounding and bizarre to be able to release such a powerful aura in the Foundation Establishment stage!
Originally, the Sacred Leader had only asked tentatively to see if Shen Tian could exceed his limit and display more strength.
In the end, after probing, his mental state of not being moved by emotions was nearly shaken.
Is this still a freaking Foundation Establishment cultivator? Go and take a look at the various major cultivation sects of Eastern Wilderness. How many Golden Core cultivators could be this powerful?
Shen Tian did not know that he had astonished his master. He was just worried that the Sacred Leader was unsatisfied with him hiding his true strength and thought that his master had seen through him already.
In reality, the Lightning Fist Shen Tian had released was just a normal attack that could be used instantly—it was just to clear the weaker monsters.
Meanwhile, now, he kept on accumulating his power by pouring in the energy of the First Essence Heavy Water, Divine Devouring Vine, and Nan Ming Li Fire into the Mixed Lightning.
Then through the art of entering Super Saiyan mode, he enhanced himself to the maximum. This was truly his most powerful battle state.
Frankly speaking, even Shen Tian did not know how powerful he was under such a state.
Currently, Shen Tian felt that he had reached his limit, and his body could not last anymore.
Extremely abundant energy filled his whole body, and it could surge out anytime.
Such a feeling made him feel the urge to release it. He looked at the Sacred Leader and put his hands together to form a calyx shape, and then he put his hands to his waist.
The almost endless golden lightning gathered in Shen Tian’s hand and rapidly compressed.
Shen Tian shouted in a low voice, “Mixed—Lightning—Fist!”
As the last word “fist” was spoken, Shen Tian suddenly pushed both hands out to the front, and the lightning exploded!
Instantly, a radiant golden light filled the whole Sacred Leader Palace. The avatar of the five divine beasts could be vaguely seen in the air.
The surging golden lightning shockwave was like a tsunami, which seemed to be overwhelming the Sacred Leader as it advanced forward.
Shen Tian could only feel as if his whole body was drained completely, and he just fell to the ground.
…
No, I’ve already used my full strength, I can’t do it any better. The strength of this attack, it should be… able to satisfy Master, right!?



                            SIGN IN
                        

There was a blinding light in the Sacred Leader’s Palace. Ten Divine Pillars appeared and absorbed the Divine Lightning that was spreading around.
A fort made of golden lightning appeared in front of the Divine Firmament’s Sacred Leader and blocked all the Lightning Fists that were coming in his way.
It was worth mentioning that previously when the Sacred Leader had been defending against the Fingertip Lightning Fist, the Lightning Fort had been shattered.
However, when facing the even stronger Mixed Lightning Fist, there was no crack on the Lightning Fort in front of the Sacred Leader.
After all the energy was absorbed, the lightning and heavenly aura around the Sacred Leader finally calmed down, and he spoke indifferently. “Not bad. That skill was up to my standard, but not as good as mine when I was at Foundation Establishment.
“However, Tian’er, you have to remember—Do not be complacent. There are many people in Eastern Wilderness, and there will be someone who is stronger than you somewhere out there.
“Although you are invincible in the Foundation Establishment stage, your enemy won’t always be of the same stage.
“There was a Soul Formation Elder in our sacred ground that was invincible in his league. However, he was attacked by a group of Saint-realm cultivators.
“In the end, he tried his best but still lost the fight. He lost his cultivation and started over again with the Godfiend path.
“Thus, you have to remember—Do not be complacent and arrogant before you are stronger than everyone else.”
Shen Tian felt slightly disappointed by what the Sacred Leader said.
This golden-halo Son of Providence is so bugged!
I’m doing my best here… I’ve merged the three extraordinary items into one and had the Longyuan Divine Armor…
But I’m still not as good as my Master when he was young… This world is too scary. I’ll need to play safe here.
Shen Tian took a deep breath and said, “I understand, Master. Regarding the group of Saint-realm cultivators…
“They were so arrogant in attacking us, are we not going to take revenge?”
The Sacred Leader sighed. “There is no way we can get revenge. The seven Saints that attacked us hid their identities very well. They were very cautious.
“What’s more important was that the said Soul Formation cultivator wanted his friend to escape first. So, he sacrificed all his cultivation to self-detonate and killed the attackers.”
Wait… What???
Shouldn’t the story be like the Divine Firmament Sacred Ground is being bullied by other sacred grounds?
It should be—”My senior was being bullied by those sacred grounds and lost his cultivation, then I took revenge for him as his junior and destroyed all the enemies”, no?
Why did it turn out to be the Soul Formation cultivator self-exploded in order to let his friend escape?
And he killed ALL the seven Saint-realm cultivators? Are you kidding!?
That was seven Sages that survived the heavenly tribulation! They were at the brim of reaching immortality!
Although it was not rare to see cultivators killing opponents that were stronger than them, each of the seven Sages could do the same when they were young too!
Not to mention that a Soul Formation cultivator killing a Sage was way harder than a Golden Core killing a Nascent Soul. Not to mention that he did it while he was outnumbered 1 to 7!
This senior must be so talented! I wonder how strong he would be without the incident.
However, even such a talented senior could end up losing everything… The cultivation world is really dangerous. I need to be extra careful in the future!
Either I’ll be good with everyone, or I’ll destroy them completely. I cannot afford to make any mistake!
Seeing that Shen Tian had understood, the Sacred Leader nodded his head in satisfaction.
“Tian’er, you don’t have to be too worried. You are the Heavenly Dao’s Son, born with great providence.
“Normally, you will be fine, and the problems will resolve on their own. Alright, it’s time to go back and prepare for the trial!”
Shen Tian nodded and left the Sacred Leader Palace with his Lotus Shooting Gun. He stared into the blank space while heading back to Saint Mountain.
He felt very tired. Not only because he had overused his power, but he also felt very insecure by what the Sacred Leader had told him.
Even such a gifted Soul Formation Elder could end up like this…
The cultivation world is really not for people that do not have good luck.
Now I feel that my green-with-red-spot halo is no longer safe!
…
Shen Tian had already flown past many Spirit Mountains as he was lost in thought.
The Longyuan Divine Armor he was wearing had attracted the attention of many disciples.
“Damn! The armor looked so cool! It has the avatar of the Mixed Divine Lightning! That’s so amazing!”
“Only our Saint could deserve such glorious armor! It looked so good on him!”
“Excuse me? What are you talking about? It should be—this armor deserves our Saint to wear it, okay?”
“That’s right! He invented the Yin-Yang Lightning Explosion Talisman after a few days he joined us, and he healed our First Senior Brother!”
“I heard that there was a Great Demon in Fog City, and our Saint was the one that resolved the issue!”
“What? Our Saint took care of a Great Demon by himself? Is he a Sage already?”
“Can you guys stop talking? Just look at how handsome he is!”
“Clothes make the man. Senior Brother looks so good in that armor! Oh, I’m fainting.”
Then, a man carrying a sword on his back appeared.
“Guys, I have news.
“I’ve just heard that starting from tomorrow, all the Foundation Establishment cultivators could buy Lightning Explosion Talismans at a 30% discount.
“Of course, only those who are participating in the trial ten days later are allowed to buy. They are only allowed to buy 10 per person.
“I also heard that our Saint had started a Favored Ones group. They are recruiting right now, and many people have joined them.
“Even the Yin-Yang Lightning Explosion Talisman’s other inventor is in the group too.
“If you guys manage to join the group and work for him, he will bless you!
“What? You asked me so what if he blesses you? Of course! You get 60% off for Lightning Explosion Talismans! Is that enough?
“Hold on! I know you guys are in a hurry. Here is the application form.
“Those who want to join the Favored Ones group do not miss this chance!”
.At Saint Mountain…
Shen Tian sat on the Enlightenment Stone with his legs crossed and his hands playing with the Hariti Rosary Beads. He was recovering his dharmic power while listening to the others’ reports.
Song Fugui, Liu Taiyi, and Eunuch Gui were together with him. All of them felt that the Longyuan Divine Armor was perfect for Shen Tian!
According to Qin Yundi, this armor was worn by the Sacred Leader when he was young.
The Sacred Leader has passed his used armor to His Highness. It’s obvious that he wants His Highness to take his place!
Eunuch Gui was smiling uncontrollably.
Her Majesty would be so happy for him if she knew about this!
Shopkeeper Song said, “Master Heavens, Haoran Mountain’s Li Yunfeng wanted to join us recently.
“I believe our organization needs intel-gathering and leaders.
“Master Heavens, do you want to let Brother Li have a shot at it?”
Li Yunfeng?
Shen Tian started thinking after hearing this name.
The fellow who could ‘keep secrets’ well and is a news reporter?
Hmmm, I need to control how others think of me too.
He is talented, and I need him to be on my side!
So that in the future…
He will not talk bad about me!

Chapter 184: Capability Of Red Halo
At that thought, Shen Tian nodded and said, “Junior Brother Li is indeed talented. Since he wants to join us, then let him join. However! I have a condition. Tell him clearly that he cannot anyhow spread the Favored Ones’ secrets after entering.”
Liu Taiyi hurriedly took out a jade bamboo slip and recorded down: “Master Heavens does not like believers to anyhow spread core secrets.”
Shopkeeper Song also nodded and said, ” Saint Master Heavens, please don’t worry. I’ve already told him that.”
Shen Tian nodded and replied, “That will do. In a few days, I will need to take a trip outside of the sacred ground. In the period of time I’m not around, all of you must remember to be hardworking in cultivating. Use all the Nirvana Holy Liquid and increase your strength by as much as possible.”
Frankly speaking, Shen Tian was still worried as Zhao Hao would also be present in the joint trial 10 days later.
This fellow was the typical MC who ‘sacrificed’ others—he had sacrificed his mother to turn into a genius and his Master to obtain the Nine-Yang Battle Constitution.
Although his halo had already turned pure gold, who knew what might happen!?
Let’s observe him for a while first! I won’t bring him along this time to be on the safe side.
After he finished instructing everyone, Shen Tian also recovered more than half of his Spirit Qi.
He took a deep breath and stored his Longyuan Divine Armor, turning it into a simple internal armor. That was the second form of the Longyuan Divine Armor. Although its appearance was not as cool and not as powerful as the first form, this form was low-key. It looked as if it was nothing special when wearing it, so it could allow Shen Tian to keep a low profile in dangerous situations.
After knowing that even a Soul Formation cultivator had lost all cultivation after being attacked by seven people simultaneously and had to cultivate from scratch again, Shen Tian had become even more cautious.
Aces up the sleeves that were exposed were not called aces anymore, so he felt he had to save countless aces up his sleeves.
After taking care of everything on the Saint Mountain, Shen Tian used Gun Kinesis Flight and left.
For this trip, Shen Tian did not plan to bring a group of people like before. That was because he realized that no matter how many he brought if it was time for him to be unlucky, he would still be downright unlucky.
Also, if he stayed together with a group of people blessed by providence, what if he became the scapegoat in the face of danger?
Just like when the Divine Binding Vines had attacked the city, Zhang Yunxi and others had been all fine, while only Shen Tian had been bound and brought away.
Thus, Shen Tian concluded that only weal could be shared when going out with lucky people, not woe!
As he flew on his Lotus Shooting Gun, Shen Tian quickly arrived at the Divine Firmament City’s teleportation circle.
Although this time he was alone, Shen Tian was filled with confidence.
Firstly, although the Big Dipper Saint had a golden halo, it was still much dimmer than Fang Chang’s.
Secondly, Shen Tian’s halo was also shining with red light, and it was not that far from the Big Dipper Saint’s pale gold halo!
Thirdly, and also the most important point, Shen Tian’s ability had leveled up after his halo turned red.
Previously, although Shen Tian could see the fortuitous opportunities of those blessed by providence, it was only images. Such as the image above Fang Chang should be the fortuitous opportunity a few days later.
Shen Tian went to snatch it beforehand while full of excitement, but in the end, he had just nicely encountered the Divine Binding Vines attacking the city.
If it were not for Zhao Hao’s providence saving the day at the crucial moment, Shen Tian might have already been sent to meet his mother in the afterlife.
However, Shen Tian discovered that he could determine the timing the fortuitous opportunity occurred after his halo leveled up.
After he had just shared the Nirvana Holy Liquid with Fang Chang, his dark green halo turned red.
Then, he discovered that the Big Dipper Saint, who originally did not have a fortuitous opportunity, suddenly had one.
Shen Tian guessed that as his providence increased, the period of time of fortuitous opportunity he could predict lengthened.
For example, when Shen Tian’s halo was green, he could predict fortuitous opportunities within three days.
Meanwhile, now that his halo turned red, he was able to predict fortuitous opportunities within five days.
Why was he so sure it was within five days? That was because the Big Dipper Saint’s fortuitous opportunity was five days later!
Shen Tian decided that he would quietly observe the situation for five days secretly. After he was completely clear about everything, he would wait for the fortuitous opportunity to occur five days later. He would then snatch the Big Dipper Saint’s fortuitous opportunity by making a move right before!
Then, he would be able to prevent any uncertainties.
Sigh… It’s still quite troublesome. It cannot be compared to when I was being a fraud.
It’s just that it was completely impossible for the Big Dipper Saint to believe Shen Tian, and at the same time, he wanted to experiment. He wanted to see whether, after the fortuitous opportunity of those blessed by providence was snatched, they would really experience misfortune, as well as whether their providence would also decrease.
If not, Shen Tian would not do something this risky! It was all for experimenting!
After encouraging himself nonstop, Shen Tian slowly stepped within the teleportation circle. He saw some strange light before space was distorted and changed rapidly.
A few minutes later, Shen Tian appeared within a bright city.
Why would he say this city was bright? That was because there was no sun above the city.
Seven silver stars were floating on top of the city, and it was quite beautiful as the light shone from the stars.
This was the Big Dipper City, one of the Big Dipper Sacred Ground’s affiliated cities. The Big Dipper Array was set up there.
The Big Dipper in the sky of the city was formed from drawing light from the real Big Dipper. Those who cultivated the Big Dipper Sacred Ground’s techniques could get twice the result with half the effort when cultivating within this array formation.
Shen Tian looked at the Big Dipper in the sky and secretly admired it as he was rendered speechless with astonishment.
Not mentioning others, just the appearance itself looked flashier than the Divine Firmament City. It seemed as if heaven and earth were transformed.
Of course, heaven and earth could not truly be transformed, or else it would be too bizarre.
…
The fortuitous opportunity in the Big Dipper Saint’s halo was not near Big Dipper City but in a remote, barren mountain. The only thing Shen Tian knew was there was a mortal city named Black Mountain City.
Shen Tian still had plenty of time, so he directly spent money to find the local tyrant force nearby.
After giving two Spirit Stones, he quickly obtained the map—to most people, two Spirit Stones were also money!
This local tyrant force’s drawn map was extremely explicit. It was clear at a glance how to get to Black Mountain City from Big Dipper City.
The distance between Big Dipper City and Black Mountain City was not very far, just 2,500 kilometers.
After a short four days, Shen Tian had encountered a passing caravan, which took him to his destination.
That’s right, four days! Who knew how Shen Tian survived these four days!
He originally thought that if he followed the map, as long as the direction was correct, then he could easily reach his destination by directly traveling 2,500 kilometers.
However, the mountains, demon beasts, wind, and sand of Eastern Wilderness had taught Shen Tian a good lesson.
One had to know that with the distance of a total of 2,500 kilometers, the deviation of even one degree would result in a huge difference.
Shen Tian felt that he was already quite amazing that he could find his way in four days after flying according to the map!
Although the process was difficult, he at least reached Black Mountain City.
Next, he just had to snatch the fortuitous opportunity at the right time. Then, this trip to the Big Dipper Sacred Ground could be drawn to a successful conclusion.
With an ideal longing, Shen Tian entered Black Mountain City. He wanted to find somewhere to rest first.
Black Mountain City was a small city, and most of the residents were mortals. Even Foundation Establishment cultivators were just a handful.
Shen Tian also did not bother to use Sword Kinesis Flight to stir up trouble, so he landed and walked toward the city.
When he reached the city gates, he saw something interesting.
It was a bounty notice—”Reward of 10,000 taels of silver to kill the demon.”
Why did Shen Tian think it was interesting? It was because of the demon on that poster. It was that Mosquito Demon that Shen Tian had seen in the Big Dipper Saint’s fortuitous opportunity.
…
That damned Mosquito Demon!
It actually caused me to be lost for four days.
Do you know how much I can earn in four days?
Unforgivable!

A huge black mosquito was drawn on the bounty notice. Its body was black and had six dark red wings as if they were dyed in blood. Its size was also quite humongous, tens of meters long, and when it was flying in the air, it was like a fortress in the sky.
Black Mountain City seemed to be extremely tiny before this Mosquito Demon. They were unable to resist at all, and it was a one-sided slaughter.
What, you ask how Shen Tian came to a conclusion from just a bounty notice’s information?
It’s very simple—murals of the black red-winged mosquito attacking the city were behind that bounty picture, and it was still being updated.
Also, to compare just how big that black mosquito was, the painter who drew the murals had specially marked the size ratio beside it.
Thus, Shen Tian secretly admired the painter—this was the rigorous attitude that a cultural creator should have!
However, Black Mountain City was still safe, meaning Shen Tian had not missed the fortuitous opportunity’s timing. That was because in the scene of the fortuitous opportunity Shen Tian had seen in the Big Dipper Saint’s halo, Black Mountain City had already become a dead city.
Corpses and bones were scattered everywhere within the ruins.
This tragedy was one of the important reasons why Shen Tian decided to intervene and snatch the Big Dipper Saint’s fortuitous opportunity.
Shen Tian was not a saint. The cultivation world was about the survival of the fittest—it was the law of the jungle. Thus, he did not bother to get involved with those he could not see and did not know.
However, since there was a fortuitous opportunity in Black Mountain City, Shen Tian did not mind ending this Blood Mosquito Demon before the Big Dipper Saint.
Since slaying demons was considered a good deed, even if his providence could not increase, he could at least have a clear conscience.
Of course, it was also partially that Shen Tian wanted to vent his anger from being lost for four days.
Though that was just in passing, venting his anger was not a crucial reason to slay the demon.
…
Shen Tian walked to the city gates, but he was stopped by a man guarding the city.
“Stop! I see you’re not a local, right!”
That man was rather burly, and he even had little Spirit Qi within him.
After Shen Tian tried probing, he realized that he was a weakling in the 3rd Firmament of Qi Refinement.
As compared to an expert like Shen Tian, who was in the Foundation Establishment stage, a Qi Refinement cultivator was too weak.
Such a weakling still wants to stop me and demand a bribe? Is it possible that I finally encountered the plot of being able to flaunt my strength and slap him in the face?
Shen Tian was slightly looking forward to such a plot. He lifted his head to see the halo on the man’s head and saw it was only pale green, so nothing would go wrong!
At that thought, Shen Tian revealed a smile. “Yes. Brother, how did you know?”
That man smiled and said proudly, “I have discerning eyes. You’re this handsome, so if there was such a handsome man in Black Mountain City, how would I not recognize you?”
Shen Tian wiped his sweat and said, “Brother, you’re indeed smart.”
That man nodded proudly. “Don’t flatter me. You can’t enter the city!”
Shen Tian was stunned and said helplessly, “Why not? Am I breaking any laws by being this handsome?”
It was the first time Shen Tian heard that he could not enter the city because he was too handsome—these average-looking people were too much!
That man looked like he was annoyed, but he still explained, “Can’t you tell after seeing the murals? A demon has been attacking the city the past few days!
“Seeing how handsome you are, it’s obvious that you’re the young master of a wealthy and influential family that went jaunting.
“However, coming to Black Mountain City now, what if the demon kills you? It’s not worthwhile, is it?
“If you were ugly, then I wouldn’t try to persuade you. If you die, just reincarnate into a different family.
“However, you’re this handsome. Who knows how many good deeds you did in your previous lives to be this handsome. It would be a pity for you to be killed by a demon at such a young age. Don’t be unreasonable and seek your own death!”
After finishing, that guard pushed Shen Tian away from the city. “Alright, hurry, and go home!”
After being pushed back quite a few steps by the guard, Shen Tian was completely dumbfounded.
He actually dared to push me!
He is just a weakling in the 3rd Firmament of Qi Refinement, and he actually dared to push me, a Foundation Establishment cultivator. He’s too presumptuous!
If not for my broad-mindedness, other Foundation Establishment cultivators would definitely teach him a lesson!
At that thought, Shen Tian nodded coldly. “Young man, you’ve attracted my attention.”
After finishing, a radiant light exploded throughout Shen Tian’s body, emitting a mighty aura.
The Azure Dragon avatar appeared behind him, soaring into the sky. Everyone in Black Mountain City could feel the oppressive dragon aura.
A few people in Black Mountain City were alerted and simultaneously shot toward where Shen Tian was. They seemed to be extremely excited.
“Welcome Immortal Senior to Black Mountain City! We’ve been counting the seconds to Immortal Senior’s arrival, and Immortal Senior is finally here.”
“Immortal Senior, the City Lord has already prepared a welcome banquet, ready to host Immortal Senior anytime.”
“Immortal Senior is indeed from Big Dipper City. You have an extraordinary appearance, and it’s as if you’re a heavenly immortal that descended!”
“Immortal Senior, if you can defeat that demon, then you will be our Black Mountain City’s great benefactor. We are very willing to erect a longevity monument for you!”
“Immortal Senior, may I know what you like? As long as you say the word, no matter if it’s treasure and jewels, songs and dances, or beauties, we will immediately arrange them for you.”
“Immortal Senior, you’ve come alone? Do you want a maid? My daughter is 18 years old and as beautiful as a flower.”
…
All the cultivators who rushed to the city gates had reached the Foundation Establishment stage.
In Black Mountain City, these people were either the patriarchs of some family or being provided for by the City Lord. They were all respectable people.
However, after sensing the powerful aura from the city gate, those respectable people who “enjoy high prestige and command universal respect” were fighting to flatter Shen Tian.
That was because they could judge that this person’s strength at the city gate could easily dominate them.
Then associating to the fact that they had just submitted the “demon-slaying request” to Big Dipper City not long ago, these respectable people mistakenly thought that Shen Tian was reinforcement from Big Dipper City.
Everyone respectfully kowtowed behind Shen Tian. They looked like they were extremely polite and courteous.
Shen Tian instantly felt better.
This should be the treatment a Saint should receive! No wonder those novels about Gods of War could become popular!
Play dumb to prey on the powerful—preying on the powerful is the key!
Shen Tian revealed a mysterious smile. “There’s no need for courtesy. I’m only here to slay the demon. What treasure and jewels, songs and dances, or beauties? They are all external things, so there’s no need for them.”
After finishing, Shen Tian smiled as he went up to the dumbstruck guard.
“You’re quite kind-hearted. I’ve cultivated for 800 years, but this is the first time a Qi Refinement cultivator pushed me. You’re quite daring.”
Upon hearing Shen Tian’s words, that guard’s face turned as pale as a white sheet.
“Im-Immortal Senior! Please have mercy!”
The guard fell in despair upon sensing the other Foundation Establishment cultivators’ killing intent in the surroundings. He was very clear how miserable one’s end would be if one offended powerful cultivators!
When looking at that man, who was sweating profusely, Shen Tian’s anger from being lost for four days faded by quite a lot.
Hmph! Who told you to bully such a handsome me? Who told you to stop me from entering the city.
And you even pushed me. If I didn’t scare you to teach you a lesson, then next time, you might meet a surly evil cultivator, who would hold a grudge on you even if you meant well for the evil cultivator. You would for sure.
That’s right! I’m doing this all for him with best intentions!
…
Seeing that the guard was frightened, Shen Tian patted his shoulder.
“Never mind. Consider you’re fated with me, so follow me in these few days. Tell me everything about that Mosquito Demon. If you do well, then there won’t be a lack of fortuitous opportunity for you.”
Shen Tian’s voice was cold and calm, but it made all the other guards, the masses, and even the officials all look at that guard.
Their eyes were filled with envy since Shen Tian was a powerful Immortal Senior that had come from “Big Dipper City”!
If the Immortal Senior could take a liking to them, it would be enough even if he just gave them a small opportunity!
They had been under the impression that this fellow would definitely die from offending the Immortal Senior!
Who would have thought that there would be such a plot twist? He could serve the Immortal Senior!
Such luck really made everyone jealous!
…
When everyone looked at that guard, their eyes were green with envy.
Shen Tian smiled. Sometimes, the enjoyment of being a powerful cultivator…
Was this simple, unpretentious…
And dull!

It was pitch black in Black Mountain City.
Shen Tian sat on his bed, with countless Spirit Stones placed beside him.
The guard looked at Shen Tian, eyes filled with envy.
When can I spend Spirit Stones like this to cultivate? It is beyond imagination!
Although spending thousands of Spirit Stones was nothing to a sacred ground’s true disciple, many cultivators considered it a huge sum, nonetheless.
That was not surprising as one Spirit Stone was worth 1,000 taels of silver—only super-rich cultivators could spend Spirit Stones without worries!
The guard was born in a very normal family; thus, every Spirit Stone had to be spent carefully.
He was a team captain in the Black Mountain Army, and that was a middle-class rank.
However, his salary was still half a Spirit Stone per month! That was only 500 taels of silver.
If the army managed to hunt something outside of the city, he might get rewarded slightly.
However, the Mosquito Demon that kept appearing in the city occasionally had caused wide-spread panic. Thus, they had to be on standby and guard the city every day.
If the Spirit Stones Shen Tian spent for cultivation tonight were to convert to his pay, it would be a few hundreds of years of work. The money a rich cultivator spent on a single cultivation session could support a poor person for their entire life!
After the last Heavenly Cycle was completed, the Spirit Stones beside Shen Tian lost their luster.
Shen Tian let out a long breath as his depleted energy recovered slightly.
He looked at the guard and asked, “Young man, what’s your name?”
The man replied carefully, “My name is Zeng Biao.”
Zeng Biao?
Shen Tian took a red machete out of his Archeon Sea Ring and said, “This is an inferior-grade Dharma artifact. I’m going to ask you some questions. If your answers are satisfying, it will be yours.”
Shen Tian had found this machete lying on the ground during the commotion in Fog City. He had plenty of Spirit artifacts with him and a full set of Divine artifacts, so Dharma artifacts like this were really useless to him.
However, an inferior-grade Dharma artifact worthed at least a few hundred Spirit Stones.
For Zeng Biao’s income, it would take him many years to earn that amount without spending any money. In addition, an inferior-grade weapon was just right for him as he could not handle middle-grade or superior-grade weapons yet.
Also, with a higher grade weapon, other cultivators might have the intention of robbing him.
Zeng Biao’s power would be increased by at least 50% with this inferior-grade Dharma artifact, and he would be much safer when he went out hunting in the future.
Thus, Zeng Biao quickly said, “I’ll answer anything as long as I know the answer!”
Shen Tian nodded and continued. “Tell me all you know about the Mosquito Demon.”
Although he already knew the demon’s time of appearance and location through the Big Dipper Saint’s fortuitous opportunity scene, he did not feel secure enough after the Fog Plain incident. Thus, he had to know everything about the Mosquito Demon, so the same incident would not happen again!
That’s all? Zeng Biao was stunned by how simple the question was.
It’s like giving me the machete for free! Seems like Master Celestial was elated with me thinking he’s very handsome. I knew he would be generous since he looks so handsome!
Zeng Biao was thrilled that he had stopped Shen Tian and started talking about the Mosquito Demon.
…
“The Mosquito Demon appeared a few months ago out of sudden. Initially, it attacked the sheep and cows outside of Black Mountain City. It was not very strong, about a Qi Refinement cultivator’s strength, so the city sent some elite Qi Refinement guards to eliminate it, thinking that it would be easy. Surprisingly, the Mosquito Demon was very cunning and killed all the guards instead!
“After that, the Mosquito Demon disappeared out of a sudden and was not seen afterward. Two months later, it reappeared in Black Mountain City. Its strength was at the 9th Firmament of Qi Refinement and could suck dry an adult in an instant!
“It started killing everyone it saw on the street, absorbed their blood, and soon reached the Foundation Establishment stage. Later, it defeated a few Foundation Establishment cultivators and sucked them dry.
“In the end, the City Lord, a Golden Core cultivator, appeared and only managed to chase it away instead of defeating it. Everyone thought that the demon would never return again.
“Unfortunately, our peace only lasted two months. The Mosquito Demon appeared again, halfway to Core Formation this time. Even the City Lord, who had formed his Golden Core hundreds of years ago, was defeated by the demon in that battle. The demon clearly overpowered him and was close to sucking him dry like the rest, so he detonated all his Dharma artifacts and managed to chase it away.
“Sigh… He was badly wounded and passed away a few days after the battle. Thus, there are no Golden Core cultivators in the city now.
“As you may know, Black Mountain City is a vassal state of Big Dipper City, and we have to pay a huge sum of taxes. In return, Big Dipper City will provide help if Black Mountain City needs it.
“Although everyone in Black Mountain City is worried about the Mosquito Demon, we aren’t afraid as we sent someone to Big Dipper City to ask for reinforcements. Logically speaking, the Mosquito Demon will only return after two months, just like what it used to do.”
In other words, as long as the Big Dipper City’s Immortal Seniors reached there in time, there was nothing to be worried about!
However, Shen Tian knew that everyone had the wrong idea. That black red-winged mosquito was not as simple as they thought, and it would not appear in the city in two months’ time. It would appear tomorrow at dawn!
The Big Dipper Saint would only reach the city the next morning when the entire Black Mountain City would already have been slaughtered. The culprit would be the Mosquito Demon, of course!
Shen Tian digested the information Zeng Biao provided him about the demon. He nodded and passed Zeng Biao the inferior-grade machete.
At the same time, Shen Tian transmitted a machete skill to Zeng Biao. It was something Shen Tian had learned when he was still in the Country of Fire. Although it was nothing compared to the sacred ground’s heritage arts, it was good enough.
The 13th Prince may have suffered a Qi Deviation due to this art, but it was because his providence was lacking. It had nothing to do with the art itself.
Shen Tian decided to reward Zeng Biao as the latter had a very kind heart and good taste (for calling him handsome-looking).
Zeng Biao was very thankful as this art was much stronger than the one he cultivated now. He could obtain greater honor in the future with this art. It was a big fortuitous opportunity for him, indeed!
Shen Tian asked Zeng Biao to return home and cultivate this new art while he sat on his bed and prepared himself for war.
Shen Tian knew that the enemy could be here any second. He had to be ready for it!
The night fell…
The sky was covered in beautiful stars, and most of the people in Black Mountain City were asleep.
Shen Tian was still awake in the City Lord’s residence. A golden flash of lightning suddenly shot up to the sky and exploded on top of Black Mountain City.
The thunderclap reverberated throughout the entire city, and the sound awakened everyone.
Many Foundation Establishment cultivators appeared outside of Shen Tian’s room to find out what happened.
Shen Tian took a deep breath and walked out. He jumped to the roof of the house and looked at the sky from afar.
A swarm of mosquitoes was coming their way!



                            SIGN IN
                        

Everyone was shocked to see the swarm of Blood Mosquitoes.
There were too many of them, and each mosquito was extremely large. They did not look like mosquitoes anymore but more like giant lanterns!
A single bite from such Blood Mosquitoes could cost all the blood in one’s body!
Some of these Blood Mosquitoes had the size of a grown man, looked terrifying, and had a stronger aura around them. These Blood Mosquitoes were equivalent to a Foundation Establishment cultivator—pretty scary.
Black Mountain City had only a dozen Foundation Establishment cultivators, but there were at least 50 fully grown Blood Mosquitoes out there.
They were totally outnumbered!
Many cultivators stood behind Shen Tian and felt very depressed.
How can we even win? There is no way! The enemy is just too strong!
The City Lord collapsed on the ground, his legs shaking in fear. “How… How could this happen? My father had just chased away a pre-Golden Core Blood Mosquito! Why is this happening?”
The other cultivators said in desperation, “That’s it for our Black Mountain City. There are too many of them!”
“There are about 100,000 Blood Mosquitoes out there! What should we do?”
“There’s no other way! Let’s abandon the city and run!”
“No! All my life’s work, family, and home are here! Where can I run?”
…
The entire Black Mountain City was in chaos.
Some were thinking of fleeing the city, while others knew that they had nowhere to run, so their only chance was to defeat the incoming insects.
Shen Tian looked at the swarm of Blood Mosquitoes calmly, not panicking at all.
A sudden event like this was the most troublesome thing that could happen to a cultivator as there was little time to prepare for it.
As long as cultivators could know the events earlier, they would easily solve the problem!
Shen Tian had already seen the fortuitous opportunity in the Big Dipper Saint’s halo, so he was well prepared for the attack!
He took a deep breath, and azure lightning surrounded him.
The I Divine Lightning (Wood) was forming around Shen Tian while dragon-shaped armor appeared on him.
It was the Azure Armor Formation recorded in the Five Heavenly Lightning Cultivation Technique.
Unlike the defensive Black Tortoise Armor, Azure Dragon Armor focused on healing and Spirit Qi recovery.
Shen Tian knew that he would fight a battle of attrition against many opponents. Thus, this formation was the most logical choice.
It was definitely not because the Azure Dragon Armor looked better than Black Tortoise Armor!
He yelled, “Everyone, please remain calm! I’m here! There’s no way we are going to lose to them!”
Shen Tian took an azure formation disk out of his Archeon Sea Ring and placed it on top of the city fortress.
Then, an azure dragon appeared from the sky. Its roar was heard from miles away, and dark clouds gathered around it.
At the same time, azure-colored lights appeared in all four directions around Black Mountain City. A transparent energy shield appeared around the city and protected it by absorbing the Spirit Qi in the surroundings.
It was the Divine Firmament Azure Dragon Array, a weaker version of the protective array back in the sacred ground. Shen Tian was very interested in the protective array Zhang Yunxi had set back in Fog City. Thus, he had asked Qin Yundi to help him find Heavenly Venerable Golden Lotus for an array formation disk in exchange for a bottle of Nirvana Holy Liquid before he reached here.
He had planted the disk the previous night, and all he needed to do now was to set the core disk in order to activate the array formation.
Why did Shen Tian only set up an Azure Dragon Formation instead of the Divine Firmament Protective Array?
First, Shen Tian was not strong enough to complete the full array.
Second, he wanted to bait the Mosquito Demon out!
After Shen Tian completed the array, the Blood Mosquitoes reached the city.
Boom!
Ripples formed on the array formation’s surface, and strikes of lightning zapped around. Soon, countless Blood Mosquitoes were toasted by the Divine Lightning and fell dead on the ground. However, more Blood Mosquitoes flew up to take the spot of their fallen comrades.
Shen Tian took out his Lotus Shooting Gun and shouted, “Attack them! Use flying swords and arrows to attack them now while the array is still working! If not, we are all doomed when the array is broken!”
Shen Tian’s words gave people the hope to live again.
Indeed, humans would have depressing thoughts when they were desperate. However, as long as they were able to see the light in the darkness, they would do anything to reach for that light!
Everyone in the city was working together right now!
Dharma artifacts flew out from everywhere and attacked the Blood Mosquitoes together with the rain of arrows that were pouring at the same location.
It was the cultivators in the city and the city guards.
Black Mountain City no longer depended on the Immortal Senior anymore—they were using their own strength to fend off these monsters!
Although each individual had negligible power in this battle, they were strong collectively as a whole!
Shen Tian looked at the guards and the rest doing their best to defend their home and felt very pleased.
These people are indeed worth my effort to save!
I’ll fight to my heart’s content too!
…
As more and more Blood Mosquitoes swarmed toward them, Shen Tian gave a scoff.
“Let me show you the power of a whale!”
Boom!
The Lightning Explosion Talismans exploded among the Blood Mosquitoes one after another without stopping. Each talisman caused a giant explosion that killed multiple Blood Mosquitoes at once. All the cultivators were shocked by this move.
Damn! This is the supreme-grade Lightning Explosion Talisman! It is worth a few hundred Spirit Stones per piece!
How many did he use just now? 1,2,3,4,5…
Shen Tian had used at least a few hundreds of them, and he had yet to stop!
The continuous explosion was like a firework display, stunning everyone!
This Immortal Senior from Big Dipper City is so rich!
How was that even a whale? He was more like a Game Master!
Anyway, how much is the reward for killing this Mosquito Demon? You are spending a few million for a reward that’s worth a hundred? What’s wrong with you!?
Black Mountain City’s cultivators were touched by how generous this Immortal Senior was.
Some of them even started tearing—definitely not because they suddenly realized how poor they were…
Shen Tian had no idea that his action had caused such an impact on the poor cultivators. His focus was not on how much he was spending, as he only wanted to bait out the Final BOSS. Otherwise, he might be too late, and the real Big Dipper Saint could appear here!
He needed to kill their leader fast!

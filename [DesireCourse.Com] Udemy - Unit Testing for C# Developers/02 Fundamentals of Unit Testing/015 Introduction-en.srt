00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In this section, we're going to explore the

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
fundamentals of unit testing. So you're going to learn about characteristics

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
of good unit tests. What to test and what not to test,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
this is one of the common questions I get from a lot of my students,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
they say, "Mosh, I don't know what to test!" So in this section, I'm going to give you some

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
guidelines that help you get started. You're also going to learn about

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
naming and organizing your tests, along with some basic

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
techniques for writing clean and maintainable tests. And finally you're

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
going to learn how to write reliable tests that don't lie.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So, when they pass, you know that your production code is working,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and when they fail, you know that there is something wrong in the production code.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So now, let's get started!

Chapter 515: Yu Qiqi 
*Swoosh!*
The Four-eared Amber Cat sprinted from the park and landed right at Xia Fei’s feet.
At the side, the expression on Yu Qiqi’s face was very peculiar, appearing to be shivering badly, sneaking peeks at the ugly cat with a pale face.
“Listen here; from today onward, this lady will be your mistress. You must listen to everything she says no matter what!” Xia Fei instructed the Four-eared Amber Cat loudly.
The strange-looking cat hurriedly nodded. Accepting someone as mistress would allow it to get far away from Xia Fei and the terrifying Holy beast Shatterstar—an outcome that the Four-eared Amber Cat could hardly wait to happen.
Yu Qiqi’s little face turned green because the Four-eared Amber Cat had turned to look at her.
The two attendants were also quite afraid since Yu Qiqi was hiding behind them, but they were only afraid that their mistress would blame them, so they had no choice but to grit their teeth and stand their ground.
“Go,” Xia Fei ordered, setting the cat off to go diving right for Yu Qiqi.
It was very glad to do so, but it was too bad that the Four-eared Amber Cat was truly too ugly, so no matter how hard it tried to warm up to its new mistress, all anyone could see was ferocity and savagery!
“Ahhhhh!”
Yu Qiqi and her attendants all hugged each other and let out their terrified wails!
The Four-eared Amber Cat felt that something was off, so it tried to lick her ankle. Given how sunny the weather was, Yu Qiqi had opted to wear a short dress, which exposed her calves.
This lick was super effective, though not in the way the cat had expected. Yu Qiqi’s wailing increased in intensity as tears began falling freely. Her two attendants were not faring any better, so the three girls all just hugged one another, crying such that any onlooker could not help but feel their hair stand.
Xia Fei was perplexed, wondering to himself, ‘You’re the one who wants this hideous-looking cat, so why are you crying now?’
Yu Sansui came dashing out to the back, barely catching his breath. The man had of course heard the cries that Yu Qiqi was letting out, which was when he suddenly recalled the show he had arranged would soon be exposed; thus, he quickly hurried over.
“Overseer! Quick call the Four-eared Amber Cat back!” called Yu Sansui anxiously.
He really wanted to demonstrate his manliness and help save Miss Qi, but his fear of the Four-eared Amber Cat unfortunately made his heart tremble, and he did not dare even to get near it at all.
“Why?” Xia Fei could vaguely sense the strangeness of the situation, so he arched his eyebrow and asked quizzically. “Miss Qi likes the Four-eared Amber Cat, so why is she crying now?”
“N-No no no…”
Yu Sansui experienced becoming tongue-tied in his anxiety to speak, and before he could even properly formulate a sentence, Xia Fei loudly called, “I get it. Four-eared Amber Cat, you need to be more affectionate with your mistress!”
*Pa!*
The Four-eared Amber Cat received its orders and went leaping, landing easily on Yu Qiqi’s shoulder, licking Miss Qi’s head of hair.
This was akin to stabbing the hornet’s nest as Yu Qiqi suddenly let out a sound similar to the cry of a dolphin. Despite the lady looking very petite and proper, she had a very high-pitched voice, which made it such that people ten miles away could all hear her screams.
*Slap slap slap!*
Yu Sansui sent a series of slaps to himself, blurting out incoherently as he admitted his mistake.
Xia Fei saw that his chance was upon him, so he called the Four-eared Amber Cat back and had it lay waiting by the corner of the wall.
“Miss Qi, just what is going on here? You’d better explain yourself.”
Yu Qiqi was carried over to sit on a stone bench as her two attendants and Yu Sansui attended to her.
It took some time before she calmed herself down. Yu Qiqi used a handkerchief to wipe her tears away as she told Xia Fei of how Yu Sansui had sought her out and came up with a plan to embarrass Xia Fei.
Yu Sansui sweated bullets as he heard her account. Yu Qiqi was a stubborn and wilful young lady of the family, so after having had her ego beaten, she pushed all the blame onto Yu Sansui’s lap, but Yu Sansui still had no way of refuting this accusation. Everyone knew Miss Qi’s nickname as the demoness, and offending her meant that they would most likely suffer a fate worse than death.
Hearing Yu Qiqi giving her tearful account, XIa Fei more or less knew about the whole situation.
Sighing, he said emotionlessly, “Miss Qi, if that’s the case, you should head back. Do less pranks in the future.”
His tone was quite cold; the apple of Patriarch Yujiang’s eye Yu Qiqi would of course not learn her lesson as she harbored a dislike for Xia Fei deep down.
Leaving with her two attendants in tow, Yu Qiqi had a sullen expression, her two hands placed on her hips as she said, “Good one, Xia Fei. Now, see if I’m going to complain about you to the patriarch! You dared to bully this lady, then I’ll let you have an unbearable time here!”
Xia Fei smiled and pointed at Yu Qiqi. “Four-eared Amber Cat, I want you now to send Miss Qi back home. Don’t make any mistakes!”
*Whoosh!*
The Four-eared Amber Cat was very fearful of Xia Fei, such that there was not a single order from the man that it would dare to disobey, so it went chasing after Yu Qiqi.
Yu Qiqi and her two attendants ran off as quickly as they could, no longer sparing the time to spout ruthless words.
As the saying went: ‘Everything has its vanquisher.’ Everyone would all fawn and dote on Yu Qiqi as she grew older, yet today she happened to have met Xia Fei, someone who simply would not relent out of sympathy or pity for anyone. As such, she ended up suffering heavily from this encounter and in disgrace.
Yu Sansui was shocked. Never had he expected Xia Fei not to give Yu Qiqi any face. She was the progenitor’s granddaughter who dared to bully even the patriarch himself! Did he not know death?
…
Exotic beasts were loyal, and the Four-eared Amber Cat really escorted Yu Qiqi back to the Yu family capital before returning to the Roaring Tiger Park.
Yu Qiqi was no longer as proud as before, having lost an exquisite leather shoe, as well as a pair of North Pearl earrings, while she fled. Her silky hair was disheveled, and her short dress was torn up a lot from the tree branches, revealing parts of her thigh, looking absolutely in a mess.
Her two attendants did not fare any better, and even their energy bikes had been left behind, running all the way back to the city with what skills they had from cultivating the Law of Space.
Yu Qiqi got more and more furious the more she thought about it. She had cried in front of Xia Fei; how precious were these tears of Miss Qi? However, Xia Fei did not forgive her and even told the Four-eared Amber Cat to escort her back, which was very evidently his way of pranking her back.
Yu Qiqi very quickly came to the conclusion that Xia Fei was a devious, cunning, and hateful cad who did not how to show concern for the fairer sex!
Livid, Yu Qiqi stuck to the side paths and avoided the main road as she led her two attendants back home, afraid of letting anyone see her abject state.
Taking a turn into an alley, she happened to have bumped into a young man who was just in his twenties. He immediately stopped and asked with concern, “Forty-ninth sister, what happened to you!”
Yu Qiqi was the forty-ninth, and her name Qiqi also meant to point out how 7 and 7 made 49.
The young man speaking was called Yu Taizhou. Though they all shared the surname Yu, there was still a difference in terms of kinship; Yu Qiqi was the progenitor’s granddaughter, while Yu Taizhou was just another family member. Their status differed greatly.
Yu Qiqi was considered a top-tier beauty in the family with plenty of suitors, and Yu Taizhou could be considered to be one of them. However, Yu Qiqi had always had an unruly personality as she was the apple of the patriarch’s eye, so most of her suitors only dared to look but not get near her.
Today, Yu Qiqi looked completely haggard, and Yu Taizhou saw it as his chance. If he were to show that he was capable in front of Yu Qiqi, his future prospects might just improve tremendously!
Yu Qiqi rolled her eyes at Yu Taizhou and spat, “None of your business! Scram!”
Yu Taizhou did not relent and continued smiling as he asked, “Forty-ninth sister, tell big brother just what’s wrong. Big brother here will help you seek justice!”
Yu Qiqi hated men who wanted to play heroes in shining armor, saving pretty damsels in distress. Just as she was about to explode at him, a plan came to her.
“Big brother Taizhou.” Yu Qiqi acted all pitiful with her red eyes, her voice turning so soft that Yu Taizhou’s heart nearly melted.
“What’s the matter?”
“Someone… bullied me…” Yu Qiqi had very good acting skills, sniffling as if she were on the verge of tears.
“Who? Just who would be so bold to do that?! Big brother shall help you teach them a lesson!” Yu Taizhou angrily yelled.
Yu Qiqi softly answered, “Xia Fei, the new overseer at the Roaring Tiger Park actually set an exotic beast to bite me.”
Yu Taizhou was furious, patting his chest there and then to promise that he would decapitate Xia Fei and so on.
“I remember now! The day after will be the time when the newly promoted Law Warriors will get to choose their martial arts techniques. When that time comes, Xia Fei and all the other newly promoted Law Warriors will stay in the collection reservoir for up to three days, and that’s the perfect chance! I’ll make sure that he enters the place and never leaves!” Yu Taizhou viciously declared.
Yu Qiqi’s eyes sparkled as she said sweetly, “Then I’ll have to rely on you, Brother Taizhou. When that time comes, I’ll make my way over personally to watch the fight.”
“Don’t worry. Leave this matter to me. I’m friendly with several of the newly promoted Law Warriors, so I’ll secretly inform them what to do.”
“Xia Fei, you will never imagine that the collection reservoir is going to be your gravesite!”
Yu Qiqi knew she was actually at fault, so she got Taizhou to swear this matter to secrecy before saying her goodbyes and leaving.
…
Xia Fei did not exactly have a smooth first day as the overseer of the Roaring Tiger Park. Not only did Furball end up scaring most of their exotic beasts to death, he also became the subject of both Yu Sansui and Yuqiqi’s prank. Too bad that they had underestimated Xia Fei, ending up degrading and embarrassing themselves.
Yu Sansui knew how powerful Xia Fei was, so he admitted his mistake straight away, even swearing that he would not make the same mistake ever again.
Xia Fei did not wish to make too many enemies after joining the Yu family so soon, which was why he decided to let him off this one time.
The huge energy expenditure hung about him like a curse, pressing down on Xia Fei so he could hardly breathe. Having exchanged a hundred grade 2 Origin Crystals at Haoping’s shop, he was down to his final ton of Purple Hearts of Spirits. If he could not find any way to make money, Furball would just have to go back to simple fare, and Xia Fei had no choice but to decrease his cultivation speed as well.
His second day in the Roaring Tiger park was exceptionally peaceful. Only two out of the seventeen exotic beasts remained, and these two had become very docile and obedient after, lying on the ground in the compound and not daring to make too loud a noise.
The Roaring Tiger Park never experienced such quiet before, so the employees suddenly realized that following Xia Fei would not be a bad thing, since their day-to-day lives would at least be a lot more peaceful, no longer having to worry about being ambushed by the exotic beasts.
On the third day, Xia Fei cleaned up early, for today was the big day when the collection reservoir would be opened!
A warrior choosing what sort of martial arts technique would determine how great a combat strength they could exert in future battles to a great extent, and just how far they could go on this warrior’s path.
Xia Fei was filled with expectations, looking forward to acquiring a quality martial arts technique in these three days and adding it to his arsenal.
About two hundred or so people were gathered in that dirt field, and a good majority of them were newly minted Law Warriors like himself, as well as some who had chosen to pick their martial arts technique again because they were dissatisfied with their choices before.
Of course, it was not easy to get another chance to pick their martial arts technique from the collection reservoir again, unless they were directly related to progenitors of the Yu family or they had performed exceptionally well in the city.
Xia Fei found a quiet corner to stand, silently waiting for the reservoir to open. Not too far away, furious pairs of glaring eyes had caught his attention.
“Xia Fei, do you feel the unfriendly looks coming from the eyes of those men there?” Phantom asked with knitted eyebrows.



Chapter-516-Enemy-of-the-People
Chapter 516: Enemy of the People! 
“Xia Fei, do you feel the unfriendly looks coming from the eyes of those men there?” Phantom asked with knitted eyebrows.
Xia Fei nodded but he was somewhat nonplussed by this. All those faces there were unfamiliar to him, so why would they have such strong killing intent toward him from out of nowhere?
Seven or eight men had gathered under a big tree, whispering to one another in low voices as they threw furtive glances in Xia Fei’s direction. They looked to be about the same age as Xia Fei, most likely their second time heading into the reservoir to pick martial arts techniques, which meant that they were at least level 2 Law Warriors or higher.
Xia Fei frowned. The reservoir was a completely sealed space, so he would be in quite the pickle if he found himself surrounded by several high-level Law Warriors. Even if he could survive the attack, it would still affect his picking of a martial arts technique.
Soon, the head instructor, Yu Luxuan, arrived at the scene, sweeping his gaze across the crowd gathered. A light flick of his finger and a circle promptly appeared on the ground.
“In fifteen minutes’ time, the collection reservoir shall open, and since there are plenty of you who will be entering the place for the first time, I’ll repeat the rules for the benefit of everyone here.”
*Whoosh!*
A red glowing orb suddenly appeared in Yu Luxuan’s palm. Pointing at it with one finger, he began. “Upon entering the reservoir, you will notice many such glowing orbs. Each one of them will have a martial arts technique stored within.”
*Pa!*
The glowing orb suddenly cracked like an egg, revealing a black metal device inside.
“This will be the form in which a martial arts technique is recorded in, and you can read what’s within as long as you extend your consciousness to it.”
*Clink*
Yu Luxuan then flipped his palm over, and four different glowing orbs appeared from out of nowhere. They were red, purple, white, and yellow respectively.
“Red is rank 1, purple is rank 2, white is rank 3, and yellow… well, that’s rank 4. The system in the collection reservoir is automated recognition, so unless the system deems you as someone who has the qualifications to learn better martial arts techniques, the white and yellow orbs won’t appear. Of course, the system releasing these better martial arts techniques is one thing; whether you can acquire them is another. It will all depend on your cultivation.”
“The only rule in the reservoir is that there are no rules! Whether you snatch or steal them, as long as you’re able to obtain a martial arts technique you desire, then that is considered as you having succeeded! People may die or get injured along the way, and as a warrior, you must all understand that this is the Law Realm! Danger abounds and a warrior had better get used to the smell of blood.”
After a simple overview of the rules, Yu Luxuan called the over two hundred warriors into the circle he had drawn.
“I’ll be placing all of you into a spatial door which will transfer you inside, and upon entry, there’s no way for anyone to leave in the next seventy-two hours. All the best!”
*Swoosh!*
With that said, the warriors around Xia Fei began magically disappearing one by one.
There was suddenly nothing beneath his feet, and in the blink of an eye, Xia Fei found himself transported to the collection reservoir.
Above him was a sea of stars, and the black dirt under his feet was dry and hardened, with strange rocks and mountains all around him.
Xia Fei found it very strange. The place was called the collection reservoir, yet why was there not even a drop of water?
No one was around him, and he figured that it must be because everyone had been separated, split up in different parts of the place, after traveling through the spatial door.
Xia Fei smiled. He was not afraid of one-on-one combat. He would have had quite the headache if a crowd of warriors ganged up on him; after all, Xia Fei had made no friends here in the Yu family and had been on his own all the time. The only thing he could depend on was his own hard work.
Xia Fei made his way up a mountain and looked into the distant horizon.
Suddenly, a sea of red glowing orbs came falling from the sky like torrential rain!
In no time, the land was drowning in these red orbs!
Xia Fei suddenly realized that the reservoir was not referring to a body of water but rather these energy orbs, which held records of martial arts techniques. It was an ocean of orbs!
Sliding down the mountain, Xia Fei picked up a single red orb from the ground and activated the Law of Space with his left to shatter the orb in his palm.
The Law force he exerted easily shattered the orb, revealing the black device inside.
“Rank 1 spatial martial arts technique, Cross Cut.” Xia Fei sent his consciousness within and read out the name of the recorded technique.
“Cross Cut? Sounds tyrannical,” Phantom excitedly commented.
Just as those words left his mouth, Xia Fei tossed the black piece of metal on the ground, not sparing it a second glance.
“What are you doing?” Phantom was puzzled. He could not understand why Xia Fei had thrown it aside without even trying out the technique.
“Look at this sea of red orbs here.”Xia Fei wagged his finger. “There’re so many of them out here, clearly indicating how common rank 1 spatial martial arts techniques are. Didn’t Yu Luxuan say earlier that there’s a possibility for there to be high-rank martial arts techniques in the collection reservoir? No reason for me not to get those and settle for these low-ranking techniques instead, yeah?
Phantom nodded. “You’re right. Since you’re a speed ability user, you have a greater efficiency in searching for better martial arts techniques here than anyone else!”
*Whoosh~*
With that said, Xia Fei unleashed his speed ability and dashed into this sea of red!
…
Not long after Yu Luxuan sent the warriors off to the collection reservoir, a screen rose from the center of the dirt field. On it was a 2D map accompanied with small screens around, allowing people to observe every action of the warriors inside.
Yu Luxuan and the other instructors plus some Warriors, who had not entered the reservoir, were glued to the four rows of words on the screen.
There are fifteen rank 2 martial arts techniques this time!” An instructor nodded. “There are also two rank 3 martial arts techniques… Looks like there are a few people with great potential here in this batch of warriors.”
“There’s a rank 4 martial arts technique, too!” someone from the crowd exclaimed.
Everyone was greatly surprised. For there to have been a rank 4 martial arts technique meant that one among the over two hundred warriors sent inside had extraordinary potential! This was why the system had released such a high-ranking technique this time around!
“Who could it be?” An instructor muttered to himself as he stroked his chin meaningfully.
Yu Luxuan chuckled. “No matter who this person is, there’s bound to be an exciting show this time in the collection reservoir thanks to the appearance of such a high-ranking martial arts technique. It’s gonna get crazy!”
“Make way! Make way! I’m coming through!” The unruly Yu Qiqi pushed her way through the crowd until she got to the front of the screen.
“Miss Qi, what are you doing here?” Yu Luxuan asked.
“Why couldn’t I be here?” Yu Qiqi threw the question right back as she thrust her hip to the side.
Everyone could feel a headache setting in on them. Be it the young or the old, no one in the Yu family dared to provoke this little demoness. This girl would act like so unruly no matter where she went, and most of the people in this crowd had been pranked or mocked by her, which was why almost half of those gathered began fleeing now that Yu Qiqi had appeared. Soon, the field they were in became a lot emptier.
“Hmm? It’s really a rank 4 martial arts technique!” Yu Qiqi excitedly said. “There’s gonna be a good show today.”
With that said, Yu Qiqi pulled out a chair from her spatial ring and watched the screen with both hands placed on her cheeks, looking like she did not intend to leave any time soon.
‘A rank 4 martial arts technique? It doesn’t matter who gets it as long as it doesn’t end up in the hands of that hateful Xia Fei!’ Yu Qiqi pouted as she told herself.
“Purple! That’s a rank 2 martial arts technique!” Phantom exclaimed.
Xia Fei looked at where Phantom was pointing, and sure enough, he saw that a purple energy orb had landed between a rock crevice. No one would have noticed it if they had not been looking closely.
*Whoosh!*
His figure blurred as he dashed right up to it. Unhurriedly picking it up, he tossed the orb into his spatial ring instead of opening it.
“There seem to be abnormal energy fluctuations in that direction,” Phantom informed.
Xia Fei crouched and sprinted toward where Phantom had indicated.
Phantom, who was exceptionally sensitive to energy, sensed the purple orb the moment they got in its range. In this race against other fellow warriors, Xia Fei used his speed and Phantom’s unique ability to get a head-start over others and already collected six purple energy orbs in the span of just half an hour.
Gu Tong gave Xia Fei advice before he left, reminding him to choose a suitable martial arts technique carefully from this opportunity, and that it was better to try a few more. Xia Fei had kept this to heart, which was why he had not been in a hurry to cultivate anything but instead done all he could to obtain better martial arts techniques during the confusing start they were all given.
There were small caves by the base of a mountain, their openings manipulatable, such that they could be opened or closed as required, so no one could enter once they were sealed. Warriors who had gotten their techniques could hide in one of these caves and wait until the seventy-hour hours passed. People who were being hunted could also use it as refuge. It was Xia Fei’s plan to collect as many martial arts techniques as possible and slowly search for the best fit for himself inside.
Xia Fei had collected seven rank 2 martial arts techniques out of the eighteen higher-rank martial arts techniques, which had appeared in the collection reservoir. The more Xia Fei retrieved, the fewer for everyone else there would be; in fact, Xia Fei had practically taken around half in just thirty minutes!
“There’s another unusual energy fluctuation some eighty miles ahead. It’s different from all the other purple energy orbs we’ve collected so far. It might very well be a rank 3 or even rank 4 martial arts technique!” said Phantom in a deep voice.
Xia Fei abruptly reacted and increased his speed in the direction Phantom had pointed.
At the same time that he heard the cries of killing from afar, he spotted a white orb atop a large boulder. More than twenty warriors were fighting around the boulder, seemingly after that precious rank 3 martial arts technique!
*Kaboom!*
A warrior got sent flying by a powerful blast of Law force, sailing right past Xia Fei’s head before crumpling heavily onto the ground. The man let out a rather miserable wail, looking like he had been injured greatly.
Xia Fei then realized that the over twenty members present were actually split into two, each side having a dozen or so people. It was an actual battle and a very chaotic one at that.
Xia Fei did not even spare another thought, for opportunities were fleeting!
While both sides were busy fighting, Xia Fei joined in the fray from the sidelines, his figure bursting forth like a bolt of lightning! He headed right for that white energy orb!
“Someone’s here!”
Someone discovered Xia Fei’s presence the moment he joined the fight, yet he did not slow down. With a leap, Xia Fei cleared the several meters high boulder and reached out to grab that rank 3 martial arts technique!
“Seal!”
Right at that moment, several bright threads formed into a cube, and like transparent glass, they spatially separated that white energy orb!
“Spatial Tear!”
Xia Fei was in the air when the speed of his hand suddenly increased! He had already gathered Law force and was prepared to break that spatial obstruction and retrieve the martial arts technique by force!
*Bang!*
He formed a fist and delivered a swift but violent blow to the spatial barrier!
What happened next was beyond Xia Fei’s expectations. The warrior who had used this Spatial Tear technique turned out to be of a higher rank than him, causing Xia Fei to be sent several dozens of meters away despite having successfully shattered that sealed space. Immense pain wreaked havoc throughout his body, as burning sensation could be felt in his right fist!
Just as he managed to get a footing, however, Xia Fei heard a sinister voice.
“He’s Xia Fei! Yu Qiqi will belong to whoever manages to kill him!”
“Qiqi?” Xia Fei was puzzled hearing her name. Why would there be anything related to that girl in here?
“So that’s the guy!”
“Daring to sic exotic beasts to bite forty-ninth sister, you must be tired of living!”
Every warrior stopped fighting and turned their unfriendly gazes on Xia Fei.
Among them was a young man with a trimmed beard who said, “Qiqi said that she’ll marry whoever kills Xia Fei! What are you waiting for, brothers?!”
Fanaticism!
Agitation!
Martial arts techniques could be obtained again, but there was just one Yu Qiqi!
There was not a single person here who was not an admirer of the forty-ninth sister, and hearing this piece of news caused everyone to rub their fists, for they intended to take care of Xia Fei!
Without even realizing it, Xia Fei had turned into public enemy number one of Law Warriors!



Chapter-517-Chain-Blockade
Chapter 517: Chain Blockade! 
Strange.
Everyone looked at Yu Qiqi with a strange expression in their eyes. Yu Qiqi would marry whoever killed Xia Fei? Everyone felt puzzled. They could not understand why would Yu Qiqi harbor enmity toward someone as insignificant as Xia Fei. Was their forty-ninth sister in a rush to get married?
In any case, what all of them understood was that Xia Fei was in for a tough time now. It was no laughing matter to offend this demoness, and there was no telling when they would wake up to find several venomous snakes underneath their bed covers or find themselves falling into a pit while walking down the streets.
Without a doubt, Yu Qiqi was an expert when it came to tormenting others, and she would definitely bring great suffering to whomever she set her eyes on if she did not end up killing them!
Yu Qiqi porcelain cheeks actually turned red? This was no act; after all, she was still a young girl who barely knew about worldly matters, and when the subject turned to matters pertaining to marriage or the bed, it was only natural for her to be embarrassed.
“What are you all looking at?!” Yu Qiqi exploded. “Keep looking and I’ll gouge out your eyeballs!”
Everyone shivered as they quickly turned their attention back onto the screens, no longer daring to provoke the demoness.
‘Yu Taizhou, you b*st*rd!’ Yu Qiqi fumed mentally. ‘See how I’m going to deal with you when I get my hands on you!’
…
The collection reservoir.
Xia Fei furrowed his brows. More than twenty Law Warriors stood in front of him, and every one of them was second-time entrants and was all of a higher-rank than Xia Fei. Each of them was an opponent he would have a hard time handling!
Seeing how the whole lot of them was about to deal with him, Xia Fei suddenly shouted!
“Thousand Venerables!”
Dragonscale Hectoslasher shot out in every direction like a fragmentation grenade! It was an insane attack that struck indiscriminately!
“Block!”
Everyone hurriedly utilized their Law of Space to block this attack from Xia Fei.
It was just that none of them had thought that this would merely be a feint from him, and that his real goal was still to buy time and retrieve that rank 3 martial arts technique!
Pushing himself hard off the ground, Xia Fei appeared to be fleeing but ended up running in an arc which let him accelerate; it was a method that he was an expert in!
The speed ability could not reach its top speed in a short time, so just as Xia Fei circled one round, his speed broke 30,000ms! It was a really fast movement speed!
*Whoosh!*
His body became like a released cannonball!
Achieving his curved acceleration at max speed, Xia Fei suddenly went hurtling out in a straight path!
The wild attack from Thousand Venerables was still going on as Xia Fei pretended to retreat to greatly increase the likelihood of his enemies underestimating him, so practically nobody could react in time when Xia Fei went straight for that white energy orb, instead.
Clutching onto that rank 3 martial arts technique, Xia Fei immediately retreated.
“Shatter!”
“Rip!”
All sorts of attacks were directed at his back!
The fact that killing Xia Fei would be enough to win Yu Qiqi’s affection was tempting enough, but now that Xia Fei had managed to acquire the rank 3 martial arts technique, these warriors were all the more enraged! Each of them sent out their killer moves to deal with Xia Fei!
*Bang!*
A spatial barrier blocked Xia Fei’s path of retreat and he accidentally ran into it. When his head made direct contact, it left him dizzy and seeing stars!
“Dammit.” Xia Fei rubbed his face as blood flowed down his nose!
*Kaboom!*
The moment he was stopped in his tracks, another wave of attacks came right after him!
Xia Fei could ignore the attacks from one or two Law Warriors, but facing over twenty Warriors who had higher levels than him would be a grueling ordeal!
“Crafty Approach!”
Xia Fei did not dare to run wildly anymore after running into that spatial blockade. Using his Crafty Approach to continue and make his escape at a lower speed, he kept dodging incoming attacks as he stuck to the route he had previously established.
These Law Warriors obviously would not give up, and news of whoever managed to kill Xia Fei would acquire Yu Qiqi’s hands quickly spread, so much so that there were at least fifty warriors hot on his heels after several minutes!
*Whoosh whoosh whoosh~*
Techniques, which Xia Fei had seen and had not seen before, were all coming after him, and he knew that there was no way that he could defeat so many enemies at once, so he had no choice but to retreat.
*Bang!*
A Spatial Tear struck Xia Fei on his left arm, causing a big chunk of it to turn purple.
Xia Fei gritted his teeth and continued his escape.
This was a completely unfair fight, and Xia Fei was left haggard from everything. Blood was oozing from both his nose and mouth.
*Zoom!*
Xia Fei finally made it to one of the caves and dove right in, activating the switch inside.
*Zing!*
A spatial barrier was erected at the entrance, separating Xia Fei from the outside as he stood there with two hands on his thighs, breathing laboriously.
“That was close! You almost got surrounded by that whole pack of Law Warriors,” Phantom said, his heart still trembling.
The combat strength that Law Warriors possessed was great, and with some of those having greater cultivation than Xia Fei, it was really hard to deal with. Xia Fei ended up taking quite the beating from them and had only narrowly escaped decapitation under the protection of Crafty Approach and his speed ability.
Xia Fei gritted his teeth. It was better to offend an upright noble than an unscrupulous scoundrel. He had never imagined that Yu Qiqi would do such a thing, turning him into an enemy of the people, causing him to be hunted by dozens of men!
“Get out here!”
“Stop hiding in there if you’ve got the guts!”
A whole gang of Law Warriors had gathered outside the cave, yelling at him. Some even directly assaulted the cave entrance! Unfortunately, they did not have the strength to break that spatial barrier, so all they could do was stare at him from outside.
Wiping the blood off the corner of his mouth, Xia Fei revealed a playfully goading smile.
One.
Two.
Three.
Xia Fei slowly placed seven rank 2 martial arts techniques and one rank 3 martial arts technique on the ground. He then sat down and shattered the orbs to begin checking the contents within.
Outside, the Law Warriors all glared at him hatefully. There were only eighteen high-rank martial arts techniques, and Xia Fei had already taken eight for himself! They were all fuming mad!
Xia Fei whistled a simple tune as he studied each of the martial arts techniques. He ignored the eyes filled with jealousy outside, letting them act wildly but remaining where he was, unfazed.
“Rank 2 martial arts technique, Shock Ripple?” Xia Fei was talking to himself out loud. “It doesn’t seem to be very good.”
Shaking his head, he took the device and casually tossed it to the ground.
Everyone stared with bewildered eyes. So many of them had nearly lost their very lives fighting for the few high-rank techniques, yet Xia Fei was being picky with what he found? How incredulous was this?
Xia Fei had already made it into the safety of a cave, and it was hardly the solution for the whole lot of them to just stay here. Though they very much wanted to kill Xia Fei and obtain the martial arts techniques he had hoarded, winning Yu Qiqi’s heart at the same time, it was evident that there was no way they could achieve this goal now.
“You two, stand guard. If the rascal Xia Fei dares to take a step out, report to me immediately,” barked that Law Warrior with a trimmed beard.
The two men who were asked to keep guard were of course extremely dissatisfied. “Then what do we do about our martial arts techniques?”
“Relax. Your brothers here will help you find something suitable. At most, we’ll just go beg the family elders and give you two another shot. Besides, Xia Fei has quite a few high-rank martial arts techniques… You guys can get first picks if we manage to seize them.”
The two Law Warriors hesitantly agreed to stay behind and keep Xia Fei under surveillance after being dangled with numerous temptations. They were considered to be of lower cultivation compared to the others present, so even if they really left to compete for high-rank martial arts techniques, there was no guarantee that they would secure one for themselves. That was why staying to wait for Xia Fei was not exactly a hopeless endeavor.
The rest left, while the two men who were told to stay quietly hid themselves.
Xia Fei spat on the ground bitterly. “To think that they’d gang up on me. See if I don’t beat you all into pulp after I get out!”
“There’s no rush to take your revenge on these people. Actually, none of them are your match one on one. Too bad that there are simply too many of them. Honestly, two hands will have difficulty taking on four enemies; just endure it for now,” Phantom said.
Xia Fei had seven rank 2 martial arts techniques and one rank 3 martial arts technique in hand. The rules say that he could only choose one, and the rest needed to be left intact.
“Best to learn the rank 3 martial arts technique. It is, after all, one grade higher than the rest,” Phantom said.
Xia Fei nodded, agreeing with Phantom’s assessment.
“Rank 3 spatial technique, Chain Blockade! A derivative technique from the Spatial Tear, able to use Law force to shatter space, able to be used in attack or defense, suitable for large-scale attacks.” Xia Fei softly recited the description of the martial arts technique.
“Sounds pretty good; carry on.” Phantom urged.
“The martial arts technique has seven stages, able to create a spatial tear that moves around in every direction. Complete mastery of the martial arts technique will allow the user to form seven spatial tears simultaneously, a devastating attack to the enemy!”
Sighing lightly, Phantom said, “The Yu family sure lives up to their name as the experts of spatial tear, having such an amazing technique. Chain Blockade! Cultivating it will let the user create a spatial tear, moving at such high speed, making it impossible for anyone to even think of crossing the tear!”
Xia Fei also thought that the skill was very decent, and it even held an aura of high-handedness, able to push forth a spatial tear, usable when attacking and defending!
A physical body had to inhabit space, and when caught in such a martial arts technique, the slightest mistake could very well cause the body to tear!
Chain Blockade! This was akin to the unleashing of a natural barrier that no one would have any way of traversing, allowing one man to hold ten thousand enemies at bay!
“Alright, this shall be the one!” Xia Fei said decisively.
…
Time passed quickly, and two days went by in the blink of an eye.
The massacre in the collection reservoir had not stopped, and everyone was putting their lives at risk all for the sake of obtaining high-rank martial arts techniques! With Xia Fei having taken eight, the over two hundred others engaged in brutal fights for the remaining techniques.
Xia Fei had more than twenty empty Origin Crystals beside him. He had spent over a dozen precious crystals each day in order to cultivate Chain Blockade!
“Amazing! You’ve reached stage 2! Xia Fei, you’ve successfully reached the second stage of your spatial technique! That’s, on average, one level a day! You’re basically flying through the stages, promoting so quickly like that!” Phantom was excited.
Xia Fei opened his eyes and used his left hand to rub his somewhat stiff neck.
Though Xia Fei had been promoted rapidly, the price had been great. Each of the empty Origin Crystals beside him was money!
The longer Xia Fei spent his time here in the Law Realm, the more he knew just how precious Origin Crystals were. To a warrior, there was nothing comparable to them. If not for the fact that he had a stock of them in his spatial ring, Xia Fei would definitely be unable to promote up to stage 2 over the course of two days!
Xia Fei pushed his palm flat out.
*Boom!*
Two jagged spatial tears formed in front of him, one on top of the other!
*Kaboom!*
Two gashes instantly appeared on the thick mountain wall, no less than ten meter in length! It was carved deep into the rocks!
“The combat strength isn’t bad.” Phantom nodded.
Xia Fei shook his head, looking very dissatisfied with the combat strength of the Chain Blockade.
He pushed a single palm out again, and this time, Xia Fei added a shred of the disruptive power from the Law of Primal Chaos. With an inadvertent change in his wrist, the chaotic energy easily weaved into the Law force he unleashed!
*Kaboom!*
It was merely just a small bit of power from the Law of Primal Chaos, yet the effect of the attack saw a substantive change!
The spatial tears were now like churning tornadoes, grinding the rock upon contact!
Moreover, they continued their way forward!
The cave shook as if he were experiencing an earthquake!
“That’s overpowered! Their attack power has increased by at least three folds!” Phantom exclaimed after seeing the six-meter-deep fissure in the mountain wall.
Xia Fei let out a mirthless laugh and used the switch to take down the spatial barrier, stepping out from within the cave.
“Where are you off to?”
“To settle some debts!” Xia Fei said somberly.



Chapter-518-Spatial-Weapon
Chapter 518: Spatial Weapon 
“What? There’s a rank 4 martial arts technique out there?!”
Coincidentally, the moment Xia Fei stepped out from the cave, the two Law Warriors, who had been tasked to keep an eye on him, failed to notice him leave as they discussed something while hiding behind a huge rock.
“Yup! Right now, everyone in the collection reservoir has all gathered there, ready to fight one another over it. My cousin told me that through this signal device,” said the other warrior.
“A rank 4 martial arts technique is extraordinary, and it’s been many years since one appeared here in the collection reservoir. Whoever ends up getting hold of it is going to be rich!”
“Of course. Even if one can’t cultivate it themselves, they can always sell it to higher-level warriors. Even those people looking to promote and become Law Sovereigns may not have rank 4 martial arts techniques, and there’s no guarantee of getting one even if someone pays tens of thousands of grade 2 Origin Crystals for it.”
The other man sighed in vexation. “We’ve been ordered to keep watch over Xia Fei, so I’m afraid that we won’t have any chance of getting a crack at it. We can’t leave as long as he remains inside, after all.”
“He’s got a pile of high-rank martial arts techniques, too, so he can hide in that cave and wait it out till the reservoir closes before safely leaving. Anyone else in his shoes won’t leave so easily.”
The two men blamed Xia Fei incessantly, but in reality, neither of them would be qualified to compete for the rank 4 martial arts technique even if they were given the chance to do so. After all, they were made to stay behind precisely because of their low cultivation. The two of them were no better than fools talking in their sleep.
Xia Fei was standing on that huge rock beside them. Due to Breath Control, neither man discovered that Xia Fei had been listening intently to their conversation.
*Whoosh!*
Jumping down, his Dragonscale Hectoslasher appeared in its dual blade form. He pressed either side against the two warriors’ throats. He had closed in on them without making any sound using assassination moves found in Crafty Approach.
“What were you guys saying about a rank 4 martial arts technique?” Xia Fei asked coldly.
The two men were deeply frightened. Both exchanged glances, seemingly transmitting some sort of message between them!
*Shing!*
His sharp blade flashed past as Xia Fei took the life of one of the two. Pressing the edge ever closer on the other still alive, he left a light cut across the person’s throat.
“You’re next if you don’t speak!” Xia Fei gave a very simple order.
“A r-rank 4 martial arts technique has appeared in the collection reservoir this time. I-I have a cousin who’s in the fight for it right now,” stammered the other remaining warrior as he pulled out a signal device from his bosom, turning it on to display the coordinates
The signal device was a common communication tool in the Law Realm, the design far simpler than that of the Alliance’s microcomputer. It looked like a compass but was actually a tool that had multiple functions, in fact.
“You’re next even if you speak.”
With a swipe of his blade, Xia Fei casually slit the man’s throat as he took his device.
……
Sprinting off at high speed, Xia Fei headed to the direction the signal was indicating in search of that precious rank 4 martial arts technique.
Without a doubt, a high-ranking martial arts technique was extremely valuable, so Xia Fei had decided that he must acquire it.
As he got nearer to the sounds of slaughter, he noticed that the battlefield was located in a place that looked very much like a crater, where it was flat and hollow in the middle, and over a hundred warriors were in the center of the huge crater! Screams and death filled the surroundings.
Xia Fei looked from the outside but failed to see this rumored yellow energy orb anywhere. It had most likely been kept by someone.
“Yu Yuanguang, hand over that rank 4 martial arts technique!”
“That’s right! Hand it over and I’ll spare your life!”
The crowd of Law Warriors was in the middle of forcing a warrior with a trimmed beard to give up the orb. He did not look to be very old, though his beard was well grown for his age. Xia Fei recognized this person. He was the orchestrator of that encirclement to attack Xia Fei two days ago!
Grinding his teeth, Xia Fei could feel a slight pain on the right side of his mouth. It was an injury he sustained after being surrounded the last time.
Xia Fei had never met this Yu Yuanguang before, yet the man took the lead in launching an encirclement on him for no reason, causing him to sustain plenty of injuries, so many so that he had to flee to the safety of the caves and only managed to stay alive after much effort. This was an umbrage that Xia Fei could not take lying down!
It was evident that the man wanted him dead!
As such, Yu Yuanguang was definitely an enemy, and enemies must be eliminated!
This was an unchanging belief that Xia Fei held!
The bearded Yu Yuanguang was not alone; there were more than a dozen loyal underlings beside him. It was normal for people in the Yu family to party and form cliques, and it was rare to see people surviving by themselves like Xia Fei.
Though they were all comrades under the same family, there was ultimately a difference in kinship between people, and resources were limited and precious.The rules of the Law Realm were cruel and bloody, so in order to compete for precious resources, it was not rare to see people in the family killing one another, and relationships were very fleeting and cheap.
Yu Yuanguang burst into laughter and pointed to his spatial ring with one hand. “I’ve got the rank 4 martial arts technique here; come and snatch it if you’ve got the guts! I doubt that any of you have the skills to do so, anyway!”
“Don’t think we’re afraid to kill you just because you’re a level 5 Law Warrior. This is already your third time in the collection reservoir by relying on someone else’s support! You’ve already taken all the good stuff, so will my brothers and I be left with nothing?!”
Xia Fei was mildly surprised. That man was actually a level 5 Law Warrior? That explained how he could give orders to others. Aside from a handful of his most loyal men, the others were no longer listening to him now that their interests were concerned.
To visit the collection reservoir three times, the backing that Yu Yuanguang had might not be simple!
“Don’t be afraid, everyone! We’ve got the numbers advantage; let’s kill them all! We can split the spoils evenly after!”
The crowd yelled in unison as they moved to completely surround Yu Yuanguang and his men.
A massacre unfolded!
Two days ago, it was Xia Fei who found himself surrounded by more than fifty other Law Warriors and nearly lost his life as a result. Now, it was Yu Yuanguang and his men who were facing a force ten times theirs and were slowly becoming disadvantaged.
Yu Yuanguang could tell that the battle was not in his favor, so he suddenly bellowed before leaping out. With a brush of his spatial ring, he took out a strange metal quarterstaff.
“Lapis Killing Rain!”
“Yu Yuanguang, you actually dared to bring a spatial weapon here—something the family has expressly forbidden!”
“The elders will surely punish you!”
These warriors all revealed shocked expressions when they saw it!
Yu Yuanguang coldly harrumphed. “Punished? I’m afraid none of you will see that day pass!”
*Smack!*
Lightly slapping his palm onto that quarterstaff, a ball on the tip of it suddenly opened up and unleashed a glaring blue light!
A spatial weapon could unleash a powerful attack within a given area, and anyone found to be caught within its range would have a hard time escaping!
Normally, this sort of weapon was only made for high-ranking Law Adepts for slaughtering opponents. Though powerful, it did not have any benefits toward promoting cultivation. This was why it had been restricted from use during combat. Of course, there would be no such restrictions if it was used against external enemies.
Nobody had imagined that Yu Yuanguang would actually secretly smuggle inside a spatial weapon! Furthermore, he intended on using this vicious weapon to deal with people from his own family!
“Release!”
Yu Yuanguang shouted, then countless blue water droplets vigorously rained from the sky!
“Block!”
“Seal!”
Everyone used their Law force to defend themselves, sealing off the space around them.
Unfortunately, Lapis Killing Rain had Law force added to it!
These raindrops were like powerful corrosive acid, melting away the spatial barricades, penetrating through the warriors’ bodies!
In a matter of seconds, all the warriors with insufficient cultivation died!
Wails and howls filled the entire area as blood flowed like a river!
The scales of victory tilted in Yu Yuanguang’s favor once again. Lapis Killing Rain killed over a hundred people in one go, leaving not even a dozen men as his enemy. They no longer had the strength to contend against him!
Yu Yuanguang gleefully burst into laughter. “The fact that you survived the Lapis Killing Rain just shows that you’ve got decent cultivation. Come and join me if you don’t wish to die!”
Reality was plain for all to see. Though the handful of warriors were very unwilling, they could only stop their assault, for there was no point in them continuing the fight.
Xia Fei pursed his lips. He found Yu Yuanguang’s gleeful laughter very revolting, similar to when he had incited all the warriors from before to hunt him down.
Getting up to his feet, Xia Fei made his way to the edges of the huge crater, staring down at Yu Yuanguang and the twenty or so Law Warriors from atop. There was no doubt that the elites were the only survivors from the brutal massacre before, but Xia Fei did not seem afraid by the prospects.
“Ha! Xia Fei!” Yu Yuanguang laughed. “You’re actually presenting yourself to me? Here to hand over all your high-ranking martial arts techniques, perhaps? Otherwise—”
“Otherwise what?” Xia Fei retorted.
“Otherwise. I’ll. Take. Your. Life.” Yu Yuanguang enunciated each word harshly.
The corner of Xia Fei’s mouth arched to form a sinister smirk as he casually answered, “Sorry, I still wish to hold onto my life, and I’ll be taking yours, too!”
“Mine?” Yu Yuanguang barked with laughter as if he had just heard a great joke.
“That’s right, not just yours. I’ll be taking everyone with you as well!”
Like the grim reaper, Xia Fei wagged one finger as he somberly said, “Whoever dares to offend me shall pay the price of my ire!”
With that said, two spatial tears came tumbling out!
“Chain Blockade!”
Xia Fei had the power of the Law of Primal Chaos mixed in his spatial tears, so these attacks were like giant tornadoes!
“That’s a high-ranking martial arts technique!”
“Xia Fei actually managed to learn a high-ranking martial arts technique!”
No one would have thought that Xia Fei would turn from a noob who had no spatial technique to a Warrior who was capable of wielding a high-ranking martial arts technique in the course of two short days!
This sort of shocking transformation was not what anyone had expected!
“Block!”
“Seal!”
The speed at which the Chain Blockade advanced was simply too fast, so these warriors had no other choice but to create spatial barricades of theirs to stop the attack!
“Break!”
These men might have been able to defend themselves if it had merely been the force from using the Law of Space. After all, Xia Fei’s Chain Blockade had only been cultivated to stage 2.
However, what no one knew was that attacks enhanced with the power of Law of Primal Chaos were odd and exceedingly violent, increasing the attack power of the technique by at least three folds!
*Kaboom!*
It was as if the ground had been raked by gigantic dragon claws, leaving gouges that were dozens of meters deep! This visual alone proved just how powerful Xia Fei’s attacks had been!
More than ten warriors got torn into two! Their bloody wounds made it look like they had been torn into halves! Their internal organs and blood were strewn all over!
“Once more!” Xia Fei bellowed. “Whoever made me bleed a drip of blood, yours truly here will ensure that you lose a ton of blood in return!”
*Kaboom!*
Chain Barricade was unleashed again!
Xia Fei circled around the huge crater and attacked, not at all going anywhere near his targets but engaged from range the entire time.
Lapis Killing Rain had a very crucial flaw, and that was that the attack range was too short, and there was no way for him to deal an attack from range!
*Slap!*
An empty Origin Crystal fell. Xia Fei had been replenishing his Origin Energy even as he attacked.
The crater had long become a blender, the terrain morphing as a result of Xia Fei’s constant attacks!
…
Beyond the battle, Yu Luxuan and the others watching the fight unfold were all speechless and in shock.
Cultivating the extremely difficult rank 3 martial arts technique to stage 2 was an astounding rate of promotion!
The head instructor, of course, knew about the existence of a spatial technique like Chain Blockade, but what he could not make sense of was how Xia Fei had been able to use the rank 3 martial arts technique to produce a rank 4 or even rank 5 martial arts technique’s power!
The Xia Fei depicted on the screen located Yu Yuanguang from the pile of bodies and retrieved the spatial weapon Lapis Killing Rain as well as the yellow orb from him. It was an actual rank 4 martial arts technique!
Yu Qiqi pouted as she spat in dissatisfaction, “This Xia Fei is really like an unkillable cockroach. Not only did he survive all the fighting in the collection reservoir, he even managed to obtain a precious spatial weapon, including a rank 4 martial arts technique! This is so frustrating!”
This was when a red light flashed above the screen, followed by a loud alarm!
A single white dot of light frantically bore its way in, looking like it was about to enter the sealed collection reservoir!
“Demon Chrysalis!” Yu Luxuan was in shock. “A Demon Chrysalis has invaded the collection reservoir! Immediately call in the elite squads! Report this to the patriarch!”



Chapter-519-Demon-Chrysalis
Chapter 519: Demon Chrysalis 
“Rank 4 martial arts technique, Wildstorm. By maximizing spatial tears formed using the Law of Space, a steel fist can split the toughest stone. Law Force applied on the opponent in such a manner can achieve the effect of turning them into ash…” Xia Fei slowly read the introductory description of the technique.
“So it’s a fist technique, which lets one unleash a powerful Law force that can strike down enemies,” commented Phantom upon hearing everything. “A punch that can shatter spatial barriers and deal a fatal blow to the enemy. This fist technique seems a little overpowered.”
Xia Fei nodded. He had always been on the path of agility thus far, and while he did learn some more confrontational combat styles and techniques, he did not use them much. Meanwhile, the pros and cons of Wildstorm and Chain Blockade were still unclear, so he needed to practice and test them out first to know.
Indubitably, Wildstorm was an entire rank above Chain Blockade, and it would surely be even more powerful once he finished cultivating it.
Speaking of which, he weighed the Lapis Killing Rain in his hand and realized that it was not particularly light. Aside from the strange patterns, there were also plenty of characters carved on it, stating that a Law Emperor by the name of Swimming Bamboo had created this spatial weapon.
“A spatial weapon created by a Law Emperor! No wonder this thing has such extreme lethality, able to take down a hundred lives in seconds!” Phantom exclaimed.
A Law Emperor was still a fairly distant existence compared to Xia Fei, and only the old patriarch, Yujiang, was only at the tier of a Law Emperor in the entire Yu family, which clearly depicted the status this position held.
Xia Fei retrieved everything valuable from the corpses. Origin Crystals had always been a scarcity to Xia Fei, and if he planned to promote quickly, he would have to acquire much more energy. At the moment, he was almost on the brink of poverty, so of course he did not miss out on this chance to earn some money. Besides, there was hardly anything wrong with retrieving trophies and spoils from defeated foes.
All of a sudden, the ground shook violently!
The entire space experienced intense trembling! It was as if the heavens were about to collapse as the ground buckled!
“What’s going on?” Phantom raised his head in puzzlement and looked directly at the sea of stars above. “Could this space be collapsing?”
Xia Fei knitted his eyebrows as he looked around, easily evading the random rocks and debris that flew everywhere.
Soon, the space returned to its peaceful state.
“Was it an earthquake? That’s not right. A sealed space shouldn’t be having earthquakes, ” Xia Fei muttered.
That was when a demonic cry filled the sky!
This scream was piercing, and cracks started appearing across the land. Xia Fei painfully covered his ears.
“Is it an exotic beast?” Xia Fei’s first reaction was to think that this was a beast’s roar, but he very quickly dismissed such a guess.
Xia Fei had seen plenty of exotic beasts, but none had such a roar that could be so frightening! It was as if it was a roar from the devil himself!
“It’s time to leave!”
His keen senses were warning him of the imminent danger, and Xia Fei did not hesitate to flee at his top speed.
*Kaboom!*
The ground was asunder!
In the direction where Xia Fei was headed toward, an inky-black bug suddenly bore through the ground!
As explosive as a volcano erupting, the rocks and dusty debris were thrown dozens of kilometers in the air, blotting out the sky above!
The already dimly lit collection reservoir was now shrouded in heavy clouds of dust, and when everything dissipated, he saw a pupae right in front of him!
Black and huge in size, he could hear wails coming out from the pupae, which looked very much like a silkworm’s chrysalis, rounded on both ends as its body shone in phosphorescence!
“What is this! Could it be an insectoid?” exclaimed Phantom in his shock.
Xia Fei shook his head with a heavy look on his face. “No. It isn’t exuding the aura of an insectoid. It’s more like…”
“Like what?”
“A demon!”
As Xia Fei was devoting 100% of his attention to that black chrysalis about ten miles away, an arm suddenly dragged him behind cover.
“Don’t act recklessly! That’s a Demon Chrysalis!” Yu Luxuan tugged on Xia Fei as he warned him.
With him were the first batch of instructors who had timely arrived. Though it was said that there was no way to enter the collection reservoir, that only applied to Law Warriors. Head Instructor Yu Luxuan naturally had grasped the method of entering and leaving as required.
Yu Luxuan and the others all wore severe expressions on their faces, and the trepidation that these elites with Sovereign-tier cultivation were feeling was evident!
“Demon Chrysalis?”
“Yes. It’s one of the peculiar beasts that the Demon race nurtures in captivity. It travels between the spatial boundaries, with the power to ruin the Law of Space and is very powerful!”
“Demon race?” Xia Fei very easily recalled the Law of Primal Chaos he had on him, something the Black and White Gods had endowed him with; they were called the God race!
“The Law Realm is clearly defined in hierarchy. We, the Yu family, are a third-rate clan, and above us are the Nine Universal Clans. They are nine powerful Law families. Then the highest existences are the God race and the Demon race. They’ve mastered Law and are engaged in a bitter fight across aeons, where even normal families like us will get implicated.”
Xia Fei was utterly shocked upon learning this. It turned out that his Law of Primal Chaos originated from the top two existences of this realm!
No wonder the inclusion of some Law of Primal Chaos to the Law of Space could achieve such devastating results. After everything, the Black and White Gods were still considered mighty presences here in the Law Realm, and he had inadvertently learned a Law from these two prime races!
The Demon Chrysalis sucked air furiously, swallowing countless energy orbs into its belly before slowly crawling away, infrequently letting out that scary roar. Xia Fei realized that this Demon Chrysalis had a mouth, though it was located on its belly, which was close to the ground, making it hard to spot.
“Crap! The Demon Chrysalis is rapidly eating up all the energy in the collection reservoir. I’m afraid that this space won’t hold any longer if this continues.” An instructor worryingly fretted.
Yu Luxuan responded, “The collection reservoir was painstakingly created by our family, with over thousands of important martial arts techniques stored within. If destroyed, there’s no hope for our family to restore it given our present strength. We need to stop that Demon Chrysalis!”
“But what should we do? Perhaps the patriarch will have an idea, but with only us here…”
Yu Luxuan was deep in thought for a good while before saying, “We don’t have time. We’ll also die out here the moment the collection reservoir collapses, so we must take our shot! Do our best to delay and wait for the patriarch to arrive!”
“Yes!” cried everyone in unison.
Yu Luxuan patted Xia Fei on the shoulder and said, “Don’t be afraid. There shouldn’t be any danger if we attack at range.”
Xia Fei nodded. After all, there was no way he could stay alive if the collection reservoir collapsed, so this fight concerned his life or death, too! He had to join in the fight even if he did not wish to do so!
He had no choice!
“Follow me!”
Yu Luxuan yelled and the group of them went charging at the mountaintop as they began bombarding that huge creature with their various ultimate moves!
“Five Thunder Smash!”
“Jade Break!”
As instructors to warriors, Yu Luxuan and this group were all Law Sovereigns, and the combined effort of their assault was nothing to be scoffed at.
The explosions that ensued were startling as a series of blasts rang out!
Xia Fei held an Origin Crystal in one hand as he used Chain Blockade’s range attack to assault the Demon Chrysalis.
“GRAWWRR!”
The Demon Chrysalis was angered! It was enraged!
Everyone’s attack not only failed to take this creature down but also aroused its strong desire for revenge!
It was as if the creature had a layer of protection around it, for not one of the attacks actually caused any real damage to it!
Its body abruptly shrank, and the Demon Chrysalis curled into a ball!
*Boing!*
All of a sudden, that gigantic mass shot out like a bullet and headed straight for Xia Fei and everyone!
“Quickly run! The Demon Chrysalis’s enraged!”
No longer focused on attacking, everyone began fleeing as they scrambled to escape!
*Kaboom!*
The huge body of the Demon Chrysalis had essentially leveled the mountain that Xia Fei and the others were standing on moments ago!
This just showed how impressively powerful the Demon Chrysalis was!
Rubble and rock flew everywhere!
“Crafty Approach!”
Xia Fei relied on his lithe physique to back away fast, all the while ducking the large chunks of rocks raining down on them!
*Crash!*
A huge piece of rock, which roughly weighed over a hundred tons, crashed into somewhere about ten miles away from where Xia Fei was, creating a sizable crater on the ground.
An instructor, who was slightly slower than the rest, got caught by the Demon Chrysalis, and it had a very unique way of capturing prey; it released energy from its body to restrict the person before sending it into its mouth.
The body of that instructor was immobile, completely paralyzed by the Demon Chrysalis. Not even a spatial barrier would have any effect.
*Crunch!*
The Demon Chrysalis ate that person, his body so small that it could not even fill a gap between the Chrysalis’ teeth.
No one was allowed to bring exotic beasts in the collection reservoir, so Furball was not with Xia Fei. He observed the defenses of the Demon Chrysalis and determined that even his strongest attack using psychokinesis would not penetrate them.
Xia Fei was momentarily flustered. Evidently, he was not at a level where he could take down this creature known as the Demon Chrysalis!
The notion of revenge was deeply engraved in its big black head. Seeing how it was eating the instructors one by one, intentionally chewing slowly, seemingly torturing those people alive, it clearly was quite the cruel creature!
This was when something unexpected happened!
The Demon Chrysalis actually turned to look at Xia Fei! It actually had no eyes, but Xia Fei could very distinctly sense it directing its cold gaze on him.
“Crap! You’ve become its target!” Phantom yelped.
*Boom!*
That body, which was five miles long, suddenly leaped from the ground, looking like a battleship as it streaked through the sky!
It came pouncing on Xia Fei at high speeds!
The Demon Chrysalis only revealed the set of teeth on its stomach when it was right above Xia Fei’s head!
It was no smaller than five hundred meters! Six rows of sharp teeth could be seen inside!
Snow white and shining so terrifyingly. There were even traces of blood dripping from them!
“What are you waiting for? RUN!” Phantom shouted.
He unleashed his full speed!
Xia Fei did not have any time to spare thinking and just went dashing off!
It was a given how fast a speed Xia Fei had, but this Demon Chrysalis actually knew how to fly! Its speed was not at all slower than Xia Fei’s!
Gritting his teeth, Xia Fei accelerated more, all in an effort to be rid of this terrifying monster.
Who knew what was wrong with this Demon Chrysalis, though? It ignored everyone else and simply focused on chasing after him, its killing intent clear for all to see!
*Kaboom!*
A huge explosion rang out!
White beams seemingly came from the sky and struck the back of the Demon Chrysalis!
The creature let out a cry of despair and came crashing down from above!
Turning around, he realized that some hundred or so people had appeared beside him from out of nowhere, and the leader was Patriarch Yujiang, the only Law Emperor in the entire family!
“Beat it! Beat it up good!” Yujiang gave the order with gusto. “No matter what, we need to defend the collection reservoir!”
Patriarch Yujiang led many elites to the collection reservoir the moment he got the news, and this group of hundreds were the special forces, the most precious and high-level individuals of the Yu family!
*Kaboom!*
Xia Fei felt as if heaven and earth had both been torn apart. This was his first time witnessing so many high-level Law Warriors attacking in concert, and the explosive combat power went well beyond his imagination!
Though the Demon Chrysalis had thick skin and enormous body, it was gradually unable to withstand such an intense assault.
“Roar!”
With a powerful bellow, the space actually got torn to reveal a rip which was as wide as a mountain!
Coincidentally, Xia Fei was not too far from this rip. The Demon Chrysalis was rushing toward this spatial tear, while Xia Fei was desperately trying to get away from it!
Unfortunately, the spatial tear had the attractive force of a black hole, and it pulled Xia Fei right within!
*Whoosh~*
The Demon Chrysalis disappeared into the darkness without a trace, and so did Xia Fei!



Chapter-520-Law-of-Energy-Purification
Chapter 520: Law of Energy Purification 
Space was not as perfect in people’s eyes. Ever since the warp engine was discovered, humans had come to realize that even space could be torn, folded, and pierced through.
Darkness.
Boundless darkness with not even a single trace of light.
Xia Fei floated in this darkness, and he could also hear the intense breathing of that Demon Chrysalis from afar. It was evident that the attack from the elite warriors led by Yujiang had injured it quite extensively.
*Ka-cha!*
The night-vision function, including the air circulatory system, of his suit automatically operated. Xia Fei calmed himself down and observed his surroundings.
He soon felt disappointed. Without a doubt, he was in a dark inverse. It was a channel by which space was connected to space. He had accidentally been sucked in, and there were some fragments of rock that got sucked in, too, besides the Demon Chrysalis. It floated in the darkness without any motion whatsoever.
Regulating Breath Control, Xia Fei hid behind a fairly large piece of rock and observed the Demon Chrysalis from afar.
After a short period of self-healing, the huge Chrysalis began moving in the darkness as if it was sledding. Its body slid far out into the distance. The creature moved with great agility as if it had long since been used to living outside space.
Xia Fei furrowed his brows. He quietly followed behind the Demon Chrysalis, maintaining a good distance away from it.
Sliding in the dark inverse was no easy feat, for there was nothing in the surroundings, much like floating in space, so there was nothing to hold onto.
Xia Fei carefully examined the way the Demon Chrysalis moved, realizing how it used the strength of spatial barriers when it moved by manipulating them as points of support.
After trying this out a few times, Xia Fei gradually caught on to the trick. By adding Law force to his two legs, it was as if he were wearing a pair of sticky space boots, able to move about in this vast emptiness without any issues whatsoever.
“Why are you following the Demon Chrysalis?” Phantom was puzzled. “That creature’s supremely powerful; you can very well lose your life if it discovers you!”
Xia Fei answered, “We’re in the gaps of space now. It’s very easy to get lost without any marker of sorts. There’s a saying that goes: ‘An old horse knows its way.’ Demon Chrysalis live in this pitch darkness, so it must be familiar with the way. At the very least, I won’t lose my sense of direction following it. Facing danger’s better than forever being trapped here, right?”
Phantom had nothing to add. Though the Demon Chrysalis was fearsome, the thought of being lost here in the gaps of space was even more frightening!
Seeing the boundless expanse of darkness all around, Xia Fei was akin to a man who had been tossed out in the middle of an ocean with the Demon Chrysalis his compass.
Though following the creature seemed like an insane move, it was actually his only chance at survival!
Hoping that the Yu family would find him here in the gaps of space?
No. Xia Fei did not wish to place his hope on others. That had always been his personality!
Casually picking a piece of fragmented rock nearby, Xia Fei held it in front of him as cover before he slowly followed the Demon Chrysalis from behind.
The deep darkness all around him seemed endless.
Xia Fei realized that the gaps in space were not completely emptiness as he would come across some strange machinery from time to time, floating out in the nothingness, not at all moving or making any sound.
Thinking that these must be things that were dragged into the gaps of space like himself, Xia Fei’s heart shuddered. The thought of sharing a similar fate with these things, stuck here forever to float through the unending darkness, was definitely unideal.
Speeding up, Xia Fei kept his eyes trained on the sliding Demon Chrysalis in front of him, afraid that he would be left behind.
Moving in this limitless dark was very boring. Xia Fei suddenly had an idea, and he tried to see if he could cultivate the Law of Space while he moved.
An imprint slowly formed in his brain, gradually converging into the pattern of Law.
Two days later, the Demon Chrysalis finally came to a halt, and Xia Fei could vaguely sense that he was about to make a breakthrough to level 3!
He noticed that there were now more floating items in front of him. Plenty of junks were all suspended in the darkness; the Demon Chrysalis collapsed on a pile of junk and began sleeping soundly. This appeared to be its nest.
Xia Fei knitted his brows and silently made his way to that pile of junks in hopes of finding anything useful. He had no idea how much longer he had to stay here in the dark inverse, which was why any supply he could find would be precious. What made Xia Fei even more uneasy was the fact that the Origin Crystals he had were dwindling.
Origin Crystals were precious, and he needed them both for fighting and cultivation.
There were only two ways Xia Fei could escape from being trapped here in the gaps of space: One, keep an eye on the Demon Chrysalis until it attacked humans again, following through the spatial tear it made so he could return to the Law Realm. Two, await rescue.
Xia Fei had already rejected the second option, so all he could do was promote himself as best as he could, taking the risk of following the Demon Chrysalis the next time it ventured into the Law Realm.
This was undoubtedly very dangerous, for Xia Fei would be exposing himself when he passed through the spatial tear with the Demon Chrysalis. There was a high likelihood that it would attack him at the first chance it got, and that meant that he could only engage in a grueling deathmatch with such a huge and powerful creature!
Moving softly and quietly, Xia Fei used the suspended junk everywhere as cover as he edged nearer, going from pile to pile, quietly sifting through for anything valuable.
Several hours passed, and Xia Fei had found nothing. He could not help but feel somewhat anxious.
All of a sudden, some junks in the distance caught his attention. It was because something among the pile looked very much like a spaceship!
Xia Fei was stunned, kicking his two legs as he drifted over.
As he got closer, Xia Fei could finally make out what it was.
Compared to the Yu family’s ship that could take every kin to travel the stars, this ship was pitifully small and seemed to fit only a single person. The ship’s hull had already been badly damaged, and the engine system was strewn out, no longer usable.
Xia Fei entered the ship through the breach and began searching for anything valuable inside.
The ship was small, and it was even more cramped than Xia Fei’s Vampire.
Several minutes later, Xia Fei sat on the sofa in the lounge, feeling disappointed. In fact, he was floating rather than sitting, since there was no gravity to speak of, and half his butt was hanging suspended in the air.
With nothing to show for, Xia Fei buried his head in his two hands dejectedly.
Across the sofa was a towering metal carving, which Xia Fei felt like he had seen someplace else before.
“Oh, I remember now! Isn’t that the same pattern engraved in Energy Master Duba’s courtyard? It’s the level 1 Law of Energy Purification!” Phantom gasped.
Xia Fei nodded. “No wonder I found it familiar, so it’s the Law of Energy Purification pattern. The original owner of this ship must be an Energy Master—hence, the presence of this carved metal painting in the lounge.”
Approaching the painting, Xia Fei used his finger to trace the pattern carved onto the metal.
Slightly using force, the pattern actually moved several centimeters to the left!
“Hmm? This painting looks to be manipulatable. There seems to be something behind it!” Phantom exclaimed.
Xia Fei used a bit more strength, and the entire pattern shifted to the right!
It turned out that this painting could slide from behind; the mechanism for it had already been badly damaged from the incident, so Xia Fei was able to shift the painting without much effort, revealing a safe installed to the wall!
Xia Fei hurriedly reached out to probe it, hoping to unlock the safe.
His finger came into contact with a solid metal surface some two centimeters off which prevented him from touching the safe directly.
Xia Fei rubbed the lingering pain on his fingertip and said, “This is a barrier! A spatial barrier!”
He finally found a potentially valuable safe, but there was a barrier around it. Xia Fei could not help but feel vexed about this.
Nonetheless, Xia Fei knew of a method that could break such a spatial barrier—
The Law of Primal Chaos!
Reality had proven, time and again, that the Law of Primal Chaos, originating from the God Race, had great disruptive power, and any Law that came into contact with it would inadvertently be distorted and twisted before ultimately breaking!
Xia Fei leaned close to the wall and pressed that spatial barrier around the safe with a single palm.
Breath Control could dampen the air and sound around him, so Xia Fei leaned in an effort to include the safe into the coverage of his Breath Control. With this, even if he caused a loud explosion, it would not propagate.
*Bang!*
When he mixed the Law of Space and Law of Primal Chaos and struck the safe, a loud sound did in fact ring about, but it had been muffled by Xia Fei’s proximity, so it did not travel out.
“What a powerful barrier!” Xia Fei gritted his teeth. “Again! I refuse to believe that I can’t shatter it!”
…
Half an hour and six grade 2 Origin Crystals later, the barrier finally shattered!
Xia Fei first looked through the ship’s porthole to see if the Demon Chrysalis was still asleep, and upon confirmation that its slumber had not been disturbed, he opened the safe and retrieved the two items inside.
The first was a yellow Origin Crystal, while the other was an information storage device.
“A grade 4 Origin Crystal! That’s a great find!” said Phantom with bewildered eyes. “If a single grade 3 Origin Crystal is equivalent to one hundred grade 2 Origin Crystals, a yellow grade 4 crystal is then equivalent to ten thousand grade 2 Origin Crystals!”
Xia Fei was also stunned as well. Finding something equivalent to ten thousand grade 2 Origin Crystals was a great windfall! More importantly, he only had thirty-seven grade 2 Origin Crystals left right now and would soon be used up. This grade 4 Origin Crystal had appeared just at the right time!
“We’re rich!” Phantom burst into gleeful laughter. “This much energy should last you a good while!”
Xia Fei slightly composed himself. He took the information storage device in hand and noted that it was not much different from the devices used to store martial arts techniques, though it did look a lot more exquisite and weighed slightly heavier.
Reaching his consciousness in, one to three patterns formed in his mind.
Xia Fei looked at these strange images and was dazed.
“What is it?” Phantom asked anxiously.
“Xia Fei gulped audibly as he replied soberly, “L-Law… of Energy Purification!”
….
Xia Fei held the yellow grade 4 Origin Crystal. He then sat cross-legged and began tracing the pattern of the Law of Space in his mind.
The complex lines rapidly formed, and a mystical and profound pattern came to be.
The fact was that, not only did this grade 4 Origin Crystal provide him with a near endless source of energy, more importantly, the energy it contained was much purer and richer!
Every increase in grade, the energy from an Origin Crystal would be purer, so if the purple grade 2 Origin Crystals Xia Fei used before were like sorghum, and the white grade 3 Origin Crystal was like rice, this grade 4 Origin Crystal would be the more nutritious milk protein.
The seventh brain region using a purer energy source meant that the effect of cultivation would be greatly increased.
Xia Fei sat there motionlessly for two whole days while Xia Fei waited by his side. Meanwhile, the Demon Chrysalis equally remained unmoving in its slumber.
Slowly opening his eyes, Xia Fei let out a sigh. An indescribable joy flooded him.
“Congratulations on finally becoming a level 3 Law Warrior,” Phantom chuckled.
Xia Fei shook his head and softly replied, “Not three, four!”
“Level 4! You took merely two days to level up consecutively!” Phantom was extremely surprised. He eyed Xia Fei strangely. “Sometimes, I even suspect if you’re really human!”



Chapter-521-A-Battle-between-Demon-and-Man
Chapter 521: A Battle between Demon and Man! 
It was as if the Demon Chrysalis did not wish to wake up. It lay there lazily, its wounds healing fast, and seemed not to need food as all it took was sleep to mend its deep injuries.
Xia Fei looked through the porthole of this ship. The time he spent with this monstrous creature had been unpleasant. As its wounds were gradually healing, Xia Fei knew that it would not be long until it went out in search of food again.
Before this happened, Xia Fei needed to prepare. The danger of venturing through a spatial tear together with the Demon Chrysalis was great, and who knew what its goal might be with the next attack? Would it lead him into the vast expanse of space? If so, Xia Fei would really be helpless and would likely be unable to muster any tears to cry about it.
No matter the case, he knew that he had to take his chances. Xia Fei simply refused to forever be trapped in this unending darkness.
In the blink of an eye, three days had passed, and during this period of time, Xia Fei had successfully cultivated his rank 4 martial arts technique, Wildstorm.
This fist technique was very interesting, giving up the advantage of range to devote entirely in furious close combat.
Attaining an even greater attack power by bearing a greater risk, Xia Fei was not at all irked by this fist technique and, instead, loved it greatly. The idea of fighting desperately in the face of mortal danger went well with Xia Fei’s life philosophy of price.
“Level 4 Law of Space and stage 3 Chain Blockade as well as Wildstorm.” Phantom listed off Xia Fei’s present progress. “In just seven days! If those people from the Yu family were to learn that, not even getting thrown into a spatial tear stopped your promotion, their eyes would most likely fall out in surprise.”
Phantom appeared to be very delighted, though Xia Fei remained calm as ever. “The level doesn’t matter. What matters is if it’s enough to deal with the vicious Demon Chrysalis.”
With that, Xia Fei resumed his cultivation. He was like a lunatic who did not spend a moment of his time resting or sleeping, devoting 200% of his energy into the task. He had made leaps and bounds in his cultivation these past seven days, so plenty of sweat was hidden behind his wondrous advancement.
This was how cultivation worked. Talent without hard work would just be futile, and reality only cared for the results. No one knew how much sweat and tears were behind a genius’s success!
Suddenly!
The Demon Chrysalis let out a huge roar! After enough rest, this monstrosity was on the move once more!
“Let’s go!”
Xia Fei dashed out of the warship and picked up a piece of armor plating as cover from amid the refuse and followed after the wake of the Demon Chrysalis.
The Demon Chrysalis roared as it glided, sounding like it was thirsting for vengeance.
It was hard to determine direction in the middle of all consuming darkness. Xia Fei had no idea where it was headed to, but his keen senses told him that this seemed to be the way back to the Yu family.
A strange feeling came over him. If it was heading back to the Yu family, they would surely be lying in wait for its return. Could this Demon Chrysalis not want to like or was it so confident that it would win this time?
“No! That’s not right!” Phantom said somberly. “The energy in the Demon Chrysalis is much stronger than days before, and it is even more unstable with great volatility!”
Xia Fei was abruptly stunned. He suddenly realized an issue and came to a different explanation beyond it going crazy after losing the last fight.
Perhaps the Demon Chrysalis was on the verge of evolution! That was why it was not at all afraid of the heavy defense Yu family had likely had in place; it was on the cusp of evolving!
A numbing sensation was felt on his scalp, and this dangerous conjecture left Xia Fei feeling unsettled. If this Demon Chrysalis evolved, the chances of his survival would be lowered even more. Perhaps even the entire Yu family could be facing ruin!
…
Xia Fei guess was slowly being confirmed as the energy within the Demon Chrysalis was constantly changing. The strong fluctuations were precursor indicators of its coming evolution.
All of a sudden, the Demon Chrysalis came to a halt, and its body shuddered violently, as if it were experiencing a stroke.
Its energy levels kept leaking, crashing out like waves in an ocean!
*Boom!*
Xia Fei was sent hurtling by the immense energy output, spinning for hundreds of meters before coming to stop in the suspended space.
“Crap! The Demon Chrysalis has discovered your presence!” Phantom exclaimed.
Due to the immense surge of energy, Xia Fei did not manage to hold onto that armor plating which he had been using as cover, so when he went flying out, he was completely exposed to the Demon Chrysalis.
Xia Fei froze in place. An icy stare appeared once more, sweeping over his entire body like an X-ray scan. Indubitably, this was the gaze from the Demon Chrysalis!
Not even sparing a moment of thought, Xia Fei began retreating as fast as he could!
In this dark emptiness between the gaps of space, Xia Fei could hardly demonstrate the prowess of his speed ability. Even if he devoted 100% of his strength to escape, he could only at best reach about one fifth of his maximum speed.
When the eyes of enemies meet, only an all-consuming rage followed. The Demon Chrysalis recognized Xia Fei. In its eyes, he was a comrade of Yujiang, the one who had grievously injured it before, making him an enemy as well!
ROAR!
The Demon Chrysalis let out a crazed bellow. It then shrank its body backward before springing out with its mountain-size mass, heading right for Xia Fei!
“Chain Blockade!”
Given how events had transpired, Xia Fei made the decision to go all out against it!
Three tornado-like spatial tears blasted off, looking like they could shred any enemy in their path!
Though Xia Fei’s Chain Blockade had only risen by one stage, their might was many times that from before.
The reason was very simple: Xia Fei was now a level 4 Law Warrior! His grasp of Law and his comprehension of martial arts techniques had doubled!
*Boom boom boom!*
The Demon Chrysalis’s body curled. Xia Fei’s attack had actually caused it to falter!
It let out a mournful wail. It simply could not understand just how a small human, the size of an ant, could actually have such power that made it convulse thusly.
It must be said that, several days ago, Xia Fei had actually been made haggard by it chasing him; had it not been for Yujiang’s timely intervention, Xia Fei would have lost his life to the Demon Chrysalis then!
Beasts were the most sensitive to the changes in power, and this Demon Chrysalis realized that Xia Fei already had the strength to fight on par with it!
“Wildstorm!”
After unleashing Chain Blockade, Xia Fei did not even pause and went charging right toward the Demon Chrysalis like a maniac!
His superhuman analytical abilities had let him come to the conclusion that getting out of the Demon Chrysalis’s domain was an insurmountable task!
There were some people who would demonstrate an explosive combat power well beyond their strength when faced with a desperate situation; Xia Fei was one such person!
Xia Fei had never been one to sit and wait, so the moment he realized that there was no escape, his fighting spirit surged ferociously!
“Put everything on the line!”
The Demon Chrysalis was ultimately an intelligent organism, and it simply could not understand just how this puny human had managed to increase his cultivation by a lot in this little time, nor why he was staking everything and risking his life like this. Logically speaking, should he not be fleeing?
The creature had yet to recover, and with how it was distracted by everything, Xia Fei successfully got into close quarters with the Demon Chrysalis.
*Kaboom*
An explosive strike!
Then another!
His two fists wildly rained blows on the Demon Chrysalis’s body!
After adding the Law of Primal Chaos to his punches, every hit with the fist technique Wildstorm truly exploded like a storm of blows!
Adding Xia Fei’s wild attacks which threw caution to the wind, this fist technique truly lived up to its name!
In combat, it was not just a contest of technique, it was even more so about momentum!
Without a doubt, when the naturally gifted warrior, Xia Fei, decided to go all out, even the god of death would have to back down!
*Boom!*
The thick spatial barrier around the Demon Chrysalis had come under the forceful and repeated attacks of Xia Fei, so much so that his fists were now making direct contact with its flesh!
Wildstorm was not about technical skill; in fact, the punches were plain and uninspired.
However, this simple and unflashy martial arts technique allowed its user to unleash their greatest combat strength incisively and brilliantly!
The Demon Chrysalis let out a miserable cry!
A human smaller than a speck of dust in its eyes had managed to inflict great pain to it, so its pride was severely injured.
Skin broke and flesh was exposed!
Very soon, a wound appeared where Xia Fei had let loose his fists, and black blood came flowing freely!
Xia Fei clutched onto the grade 4 Origin Crystal, recovering his energy and strength even as he continued his attacks.
Xia Fei was like a merciless butcher, not letting up even after getting through the Demon Chrysalis’s skin. His attacks were even penetrating its body deeply!
This was not a fight. It was practically a miner commandeering an excavator digging deeper into the enemy’s internal organs! It was as if Xia Fei wanted to find out whether the heart of the Demon Chrysalis was red or black!
*Bang!*
Xia Fei thrust Lapis Killing Rain right into the Demon Chrysalis’ body, and in that instant, a rain of blue fell! Every droplet was like fatal acid, corroding its flesh constantly when it came into contact with its body!
The creature was ultimately still superior to Xia Fei, so after recovering from its brief shock, the pain it was feeling made it so that it could not help but concentrate and earnestly deal with this unremarkable foe.
*Swish~*
An invisible thread of energy bound Xia Fei; the Demon Chrysalis used the same technique from before in an attempt to drag Xia Fei into its body!
“Change!”
Dragonscale Hectoslasher transformed into its dual blade form, and Xia Fei stabbed the two sabers dead center to the Demon Chrysalis, making use of the creature’s large suctioning force.
Being swallowed by the Demon Chrysalis would be a disastrous outcome!
The Demon Chrysalis pulled at Xia Fei, but he clung onto its body, so the more force it exerted only caused greater pain to itself.
However, the Demon Chrysalis had already been tortured to its breaking point by Xia Fei, so it completely ignored the tremendous pain. This creature had never in its life been faced with such an embarrassing situation, having been so badly injured by an insignificant lifeform. It would become a laughingstock if word got out! It was part of the Demon race—an existence that sat at the apex of the Law Realm!
*Roar!*
The Demon Chrysalis used even more strength, pulling Xia Fei’s entire being into the air, and as a result, his hand tore a large piece of fleshy Chrysalis meat!
*GROWL!*
The Demon Chrysalis let out a wail of agony from the pain. It proceeded to send Xia Fei swiftly straight through its opened maw, ready to eat him whole!
The six rows of white teeth appeared right before Xia Fei, and each one was enough to shred him into pieces!
The situation was dire! Phantom already had his eyes closed, not daring to look.
‘Is this still a loss?
‘Even after such a mad struggle, is death still the outcome here?’
At that moment, plenty of thoughts swirled in Xia Fei’s mind, and among them was a very bizarre, very insane, and absolutely eccentric idea.
‘No, I’m not going to concede defeat till the very last second!
‘Crafty Approach!’
Xia Fei’s entire body was about to be shredded when he suddenly began twisting in an extreme manner.
*Whoosh!*
A sharpened white tooth brushed past Xia Fei’s body, but dodging just this one tooth did not mean that he was out of the woods. There were still five rows of them waiting to tear him into pieces!
Xia Fei was now holding onto the Blood Crystal.
It was a very grotesque dagger, which looked no different from a club that had been haphazardly tossed aside.
Xia Fei had once been very dissatisfied with it due to its ugly looks and its bluntness.
However, today, Xia Fei’s plan was to use this dagger and attempt something insane!
Xia Fei used every bit of strength in his body to stab the Demon Chrysalis’s gums with the Blood Crystal.
“Law of Primal Chaos!”
*Zing~*
Xia Fei sent a stream of Law force into the dagger.
“Change it!
“With disruptive power!”



Chapter-522-Drain-this-demon-dry
Chapter 522: Drain this demon dry! 
No matter how much Xia Fei struggled and risked himself, he was now already in the Demon Chrysalis’s gaping maw. With his life nearing its end, being able to curb whatever fear he felt at this critical juncture was also a victory in itself!
“Change it! With disruptive power!” The veins on Xia Fei’s forehead bulged! He had stabbed the bloodsucking dagger, Blood Crystal, right into the creature’s cavity!
Xia Fei had superhuman senses, complex analytical thinking, and an insane combat awareness!
These were well-known to all.
However, what nobody understood was that Xia Fei also had a fantastical imagination!
At the last moment, with his final attack, Xia Fei had chosen the Blood Crystal. Phantom was very curious. Just what was he attempting to change?!
Crafty Approach!
Xia Fei suddenly curled his body into a ball, and he managed to evade the Demon Chrysalis’s second row of teeth.
The Demon Chrysalis had a total of six rows of teeth. Those in front were to tear while the back were for chewing. The deeper he went, the greater the mess of teeth and packed they were. Xia Fei knew very well that by the time he reached the small jagged teeth of that six row, not even Crafty Approach could keep him safe!
There were basically mere seconds of life left for him!
The yellow Origin Crystal suddenly turned bright. The pure Origin Energy was rushing madly toward Xia Fei’s seventh brain region before turning into the Primal Chaos force that entered the Blood Crystal.
His innate control of Origin Energy surfaced once more and showed its unparalleled advantage. Xia Fei was like a bloodsucking bat, drawing as much energy stored within that Origin Crystal as he efficiently could.
Most people would have fainted from having such a huge surge of energy rushing toward them; Xia Fei, instead, became even more energetic, his entire being radiating with power as he brimmed with fighting spirit!
“Distort and twist!”
The disruptive nature of the Law of Primal Chaos entered the Blood Crystal, causing the bloodsucking dagger’s properties to change noiselessly!
No one had told Xia Fei how to use the Law of Primal Chaos. The Black and White Gods had only given him the design of the pattern, not at all mentioning a word about how to cultivate it. Xia Fei had completely depended on his instinct to comprehend the nature of the Law of Primal Chaos, and what he discovered was this disruptive power!
Everything in the universe was definite.
Just like how the moon orbited earth, and how the earth orbited the sun, there were rules being followed.
Meanwhile, the Law of Primal Chaos sought to break these rules, making everything impossible possible!
Xia Fei was borrowing this disruptive power to change the Blood Crystal’s properties completely!
Originally, the Blood Crystal would only absorb the blood and essence of humans, but Xia Fei was now attempting to make it absorb ALL blood!
Be it the God race or the Demon race, it would drain everything dry!
Using the Law of Primal Chaos to change an object’s properties? If such an idea was not considered fantastical, what else could it be called?!
Xia Fei had always been someone with a very rebellious nature. He strongly believed that nothing could not be changed!
‘Law? To hell with laws!
‘Yours truly want you, the Blood Crystal which sucks human blood, to drain the blood of a Demon!’ Xia Fei bellowed in his heart.
*Whoosh~*
Xia Fei’s Crafty Approach avoided the third row of teeth, and at the same time, the color of Blood Crystal turned from red to black!
The Law of Primal Chaos really worked! It was changing and distorting the very properties of this bloodsucking dagger!
His mind was blank.
The extensive use of Origin Energy and the Law of Primal Chaos was excruciating, and Xia Fei pushed himself into a state of absolute concentration!
There was just a single thought in his mind: ‘Change it! Change it!’
A bright glow appeared!
The Blood Crystal turned from red to black before rapidly beginning to drain the blood of the Demon Chrysalis!
The speed of this increased swiftly!
The Blood Crystal was as wild as its owner, Xia Fei. In fact, it could even be considered insane!
How much blood would a pet of the Demon race, which grew up to five miles long and weighed tens of thousands of tons, have? The answer might be an astronomical number.
However, that small dagger in his palm actually intended to drain this sea of blood completely dry!
Xia Fei desperately tried to survive, and his struggle actually managed to affect something which he had originally forgotten.
That Peacock Blue on his right arm got restless and began moving.
As the most unyielding and with the strongest desire to survive out of the Thirty Immemorial Mystical Armaments, Peacock Blue seemed to have sensed that Xia Fei’s innermost thoughts and traits aligned with its own.
An insignificant being who came from Earth and a weed that grew out from crevices; in essence, they were both trivial existences, yet they both equally refused to surrender or give up, just tenaciously working hard to survive in the face of adversity.
Could this be the reason why Peacock Blue had chosen Xia Fei as its owner?
*Whoosh~*
By this point, Xia Fei had already passed the Demon Chrysalis’s fourth row of teeth. The sharp teeth scratched past Xia Fei’s combat suit, and a visible wound opened on his left leg.
The situation became even more dire with each passing second. The final two rows of teeth was a jagged mess perfect for grinding and chewing whatever the creature ate, and they were the hardest to evade. Perhaps it would be even more accurate to say that no one had managed to survive them!
The Demon Chrysalis let out a pained growl. Its blood essence was being drained rapidly, and it was experiencing a level of pain that it had never felt before. It simply had never not imagined that, what would deal the killing blow to it was not those powerful Law Adepts but rather an insignificant young upstart, the newly minted Law Warrior, Xia Fei!
In the blink of an eye, the fifth row of teeth was already upon Xia Fei, and countless thin and pointed teeth were aimed right at him!
This was when Peacock Blue, which had been watching the entire time, hesitated and then finally acted!
The blue leaf extended, instantly wrapping around Xia Fei’s entire body!
*Ping!*
The sharp teeth bit down, but Peacock Blue held on!
It was an imaginable scene; a single small plant blocked the attack of such a humongous monstrosity!
It was just a seemingly weak blade of grass!
The teeth penetrated past Peacock Blue’s leaf, and there were countless holes perforating it, yet Peacock Blue continued to hang on, toughly withstanding the teeth of the Demon Chrysalis, wrestling every second possible for Xia Fei!
Completely unleashed!
The energy within that grade 4 Origin Crystal was like a dam that had burst open, rushing into Xia Fei’s body in order to replenish the energy he had lost while supplementing the Law of Primal Chaos. As for Xia Fei, he was still holding that Blood Crystal tightly as he instigated its complete transformation!
It was unknown just where Xia Fei got such a preposterous and insane idea, but what mattered was the fact that he did it!
Black. It was a murky black sans a glow at all!
After absorbing a large amount of the Demon Chrysalis’s blood essence, the Blood Crystal turned into something completely different from how it originally looked.
It had become sharp and extremely ferocious. It now looked utterly demonic!
The Demon Chrysalis instinctively sensed mortal danger!
“GRAWWR!”
Its biting force increased again, and Peacock Blue had no choice but to withstand this increased ferocity!
Living up to its name as the most tenacious weed, Peacock Blue actually managed to hold fast against this round of insane attack!
The leaf became more and more curled, and the teeth of the Demon Chrysalis practically touched Xia Fei’s body!
All of a sudden!
Peacock Blue started evolving again!
A second blade of leaf grew out of Xia Fei’s right arm!
It was small and frail at first, no different from the bluegrass he could see anywhere.
However, as the biting force of the Demon Chrysalis increased, the leaf grew faster and faster, almost as if it had a characteristic of meeting great force with more force. The more the Demon Chrysalis tried to overpower it, the more resilient Peacock Blue became!
When the second leaf fully grew, the tables turned!
It was the teeth of the Demon Chrysalis that were being shaved off, inch by inch!
As a weed that grew out from a broken rock, the two-leaf Peacock Blue no longer felt wary of the Demon Chrysalis and, instead, mounted its own attack!
At the same time, the Blood Crystal, which Xia Fei had been mentally manipulating, had drained much of the creature’s blood essence and was way stronger!
*Roar!*
It was yet another mournful wail.
The Demon Chrysalis had already lost its viciousness from before; it even suspected that it was about to die.
Fear!
The Demon Chrysalis was now feeling abject fear!
It realized that this unassuming small human was capable of ending its life!
*Kaboom!*
The Demon Chrysalis wildly thrashed about within the gaps of space. It no longer tried to bite Xia Fei to death but focused, instead, on escaping to survive!
Unfortunately, Xia Fei was not about to let it go!
That grade 4 Origin Crystal slowly dimmed as the ocean of energy contained within it had all been used up by Xia Fei to distort the Blood Crystal, and he had really succeeded!
He had forced a dagger, which could only initially drain the blood essence of humans, into becoming a demonic dagger which could absorb the blood essence of anything!
*Boom!*
Amid the Demon Chrysalis’s panic, it opened a tear in the dark inverse and wriggled out!
“Drain this monster of everything!” Xia Fei held onto the Blood Crystal tightly, his two eyes turning bloodshot!
……
*Boom!*
As the Demon Chrysalis tunneled out from the gaps in space, Xia Fei remained clueless on where it had brought him this time, but the light from beyond its open mouth reminded him of the sun’s existence and the humidity of air which was rich in oxygen.
Xia Fei was not tempted, however. The only thought he had in mind was to kill this enemy!
Losing plenty of blood, the Demon Chrysalis struggled like fish which had been tossed onto dry land. It convulsed, wracked with pain all over, and twisted around.
Blood Crystal was still draining its blood, showing no signs of stopping soon.
As the body of the Demon Chrysalis began to dry up, it was no longer consumed with anger; its thrashing also became feeble over time.
After Peacock Blue sensed that the Demon Chrysalis was on the verge of dying, it retracted a single blade. Following the time it spent fighting the hardest, though Peacock Blue did manage to withstand the creature’s attack, it suffered substantial injuries. Its blade had been riddled with holes by the teeth, and that vivid blue color became slightly dull.
“Thank you.”
When Peacock Blue retracted its final leaf, Xia Fei very earnestly offered his gratitude.
The way he saw it, Peacock Blue was no mere plant or weapon.
It lent him a helping hand when he needed it the most, and by that thought alone, it meant that Peacock Blue was sentient and sapient.
Peacock Blue did not give any sort of response and just quietly returned to Xia Fei’s arm.
It must be mentioned that Peacock Blue was a plant that had a total of thirteen grass blades. With its demonstration of such powerful combat capabilities moments ago using just two grass blades, he could not imagine how indomitable it would be in its final form!
The Demon Chrysalis was no longer moving, allowing the Blood Crystal to suck dry what remained of its life.
This dagger, which Xia Fei had deemed unsightly, was now a weapon no one could underestimate!
Xia Fei was looking forward to seeing just how the Blood Crystal would become after sucking the Demon Chrysalis dry.
…
*Squelch!*
Xia Fei pulled out the Blood Crystal and walked right out from the Demon Chrysalis’s open maw.
Sunlight and fresh air had never felt so good before.
Lighting a cigarette, Xia Fei sat down on the grass.
He looked at that grade 4 Origin Crystal in his hand. It was now white, indicating that all the energy within had been consumed by Xia Fei.
The battle just then left Xia Fei’s heart shivering, but it was also a completely brand-new experience.
Warriors would always grow from the fights they got caught up in, and behind the dangling danger on a thread between life and death was epiphanies.
“Someone’s coming,” Phantom said severely. “Plenty of men!”
*Whoosh whoosh whoosh!*
Figures appeared all around Xia Fei.
This was a group of Law Adepts whom he was unfamiliar with. Each looked at him with their mouth agape, greatly astonished.
“Did you kill this Demon Chrysalis?” A voice suddenly broke the silence.
Xia Fei calmly nodded.
“May I ask how we should address you?”
Their attitude was very respectful. Being able to slay a Demon Chrysalis single-handedly, the entire group had thought him to be some great figure.
Just as he swept his gaze among those gathered, a very familiar figure caught Xia Fei’s eyes. He had immaculate features and seemed well-bred, with that same slight smile still plastered across his face.
‘Clean Knife?’ Xia Fei was stunned.



Chapter-523-The-Blackwater-Mu-Family
Chapter 523: The Blackwater Mu Family 
This group of unfamiliar Law Adepts actually had Clean Knife counted among them. Xia Fei could not help but be perplexed.
Logically speaking, this killer, who always had this smile on his face, was Xia Fei’s enemy, and his attitude toward enemies was simple: kill!
However, Clean Knife was an exception. He had been his enemy twice and had managed to flee with his life at both times. Xia Fei even suspected that the man was protected by Lady Luck, for not many of his enemies had managed to slip past his grasp, let alone do so twice.
Clean Knife flashed a slight smile at Xia Fei—a smile that held no killing intent. Instead, it was like they were old friends who had crossed paths once again.
Xia Fei slightly nodded and did not say a word.
At the moment, there were plenty of experts around him. Even if Xia Fei wanted to kill him, there was no rush for him to do so. Xia Fei was not foolish enough to become an enemy to this bunch of unfamiliar Law Adepts. He was very weak after that battle with the Demon Chrysalis mere moments ago, so it was best if he kept himself alive first.
“Were you the one who killed this Demon Chrysalis?” asked an old man with a bushy black beard.
Xia Fei nodded.
“May I ask which family you belong to, warrior?”
Xia Fei answered, “I’m with the Yu family.”
“The Yu family that specializes in the Law of Space?” asked an old man with white wispy goatee.
“That’s right.”
The two old men nodded in unison as both conversed. “Ah, so you’re a warrior from Old Yu’s family. Looks like they’re not in decline like what the rumors claimed but, instead, found themselves a decent young champion.”
The black-bearded old man furrowed his brows. “Young man, may I ask what’s your cultivation level?”
He was very skeptical. Xia Fei did not look like some expert, and this drained corpse of the Demon Chrysalis before him was very much a huge eyesore. There was no way anyone would be able to slay it without a sufficient cultivation, and this was something even a child here in the Law Realm understood clearly.
“Level 4,” Xia Fei answered lightly.
“Oh, so you’ve already been promoted to a Law Sovereign at such a young age. We’re sorry for the disrespect we extended,” said the two old men with mild surprise.
Xia Fei shrugged and somewhat awkwardly corrected them. “You two elders are mistaken. I’m only a level 4 Law Warrior.”
Shock!
Extreme shock!
Everyone nearly forgot to breathe when they heard this. A mere level 4 Law Warrior had actually killed a Demon Chrysalis all by himself!
That was practically a fairytale!
No one would believe this claim. No one would dare believe it!
“Did I hear him correctly? Did he say he’s merely a level 4 Law Warrior?”
“Could he be lying?”
A discussion broke out, and the eyes looking at Xia Fei were that of shock but more were filled with disbelief.
The white goatee and black-bearded old men exchanged looks, their expression spoke volumes of the incredulity they were feeling.
“Are you really just a level 4 Law Warrior?”
“Yes.”
The black-bearded old man laughed bitterly. “Well, even a Law Warrior from the Yu family is capable of soloing a Demon Chrysalis. This world sure is filled with strange oddities.”
Clean Knife furtively flashed a thumbs-up at Xia Fei along with that smile of his.
Xia Fei pursed his lips. He always had this indescribable feeling toward Clean Knife; for some reason, Clean Knife had fought with Xia Fei twice, and so the latter did not have too deep a distaste toward the former. Perhaps it was because of his brooding aura or that strange half-smirk he always did. Xia Fei just felt Clean Knife was an exception.
The shock and curiosity toward Xia Fei had not lessened. This group of Law Adepts had their backs turned toward Xia Fei as they quietly discussed this with one another, but no one could come to a conclusion. All of them felt that Xia Fei was definitely a very odd entity.
“May I ask where I am right now and how I can return to the Yu family?” Xia Fei asked. He could not be bothered to go into depth about how he had managed to kill the Demon Chrysalis, much less divulge about the Blood Crystal, Peacock Blue, or the Law of Primal Chaos. These were all his secrets, and the fewer people who knew, the better.
The man with white goatee spoke. “We are of the Blackwater’s Mu family; I go by the name Mu Tielin, and this is my older brother, Mu Tiehai. We are both elders in our clan.”
“Every clan can travel freely from each other’s spatial doors. This is hardly an issue, so we ask that you wait a while. My fellow brothers and I have some things to discuss.”
With that, both Mu Tielin and Mu Tiehai promptly disappeared into thin air.
“We can’t let that young man live!” said the black-bearded Mu Tiehai somberly.
“Why is that?”
“Think about it; he’s merely a level 4 Law Warrior, yet he can already take down and kill a Demon Chrysalis all by himself. He’ll surely become a core pillar of the Yu family, and if we eliminate him right now, we’ll be able to avoid the resurgence of the Yu family!” Mu Tiehai said viciously.
Mu Tielin burst into laughter. “Big brother, do you really believe his words? I can tell that his cultivation is definitely not as simple as Law Warrior. He’s able to speak so freely and easily in front of the two of us; just this attitude alone means he’s not one to be underestimated.”
“I carefully observed him, though; it really appears that the young man’s cultivation is as terrible as he claimed,” Mu Tiehai said suspiciously.
Mu Tielin replied, “Experts love hiding their cultivation the most. Besides, we can’t touch him even if he is really just a level 4 Law Warrior; you can probably count in one hand the number of young men with that much potential in our entire circle. The Yu family surely cares about his well-being immensely. If we provoke this man unnecessarily, the Yu family may not be nice enough to leave the matter lying down. You killing such a wonderful sproutling of theirs, isn’t that as good as killing the Yu family’s future lifeline?”
“Though rumors about the Yu family’s decline have been spreading these last few years, their Patriarch Yu Jiang is still alive, and surely you’ve heard of the saying: ‘A skinny camel is still bigger than a horse.’ Besides, they have another weirdo, Yu Hua, in their family, and he’s a Great Law Emperor. Though he has faded from familial affairs, do you dare to guarantee that he won’t make a comeback?”
Mu Tiehai nodded his head repeatedly. “There’s great merit in your analysis. A family with two Great Law Emperors is indeed frightening. In retrospect, Yu Hua was once among the best young elites in our circle years back, someone with a 100% open brain region. Best to be on our guard.”
They were all Law Emperors, but the word ‘great’ would be added to them after getting to level 5. The two were talking a good distance away, and Xia Fei had not caught a word spoken. He would never in his wildest dreams have thought that the shrewd merchant, Yu Hua, the man who brought him into the Law Realm, was actually a Great Law Emperor!
For someone of such caliber to become a merchant, it was truly a peculiar matter.
“So what do we do?” Mu Tiehai asked.
“Inform the Yu family to send someone over and pick him up, thereby doing them a favor in the process. The Yu family has two Great Law Emperors, and another elite with great potential has appeared among their juniors; looks like the rumors about the Yu family fading into obscurity aren’t true, so it’s best if we don’t fall foul with them for now.”
Mu Tiehai sighed. “I guess that’s for the best. Though the Yu family has few experts, they have quite a few elites. Otherwise… Hmph!”
….
Xia Fei had no idea just how ruthless the Law Realm was when he first got here. He was no stranger to backstabbing and such, but he had underestimated the people of the Law Realm; here, everyone was constantly plotting and calculating how they could smash their opponents.
Friends?
There was no such thing as friendship in the Law Realm!
While Mu Tielin and Mu Tiehai were discussing if they should take out Xia Fei, Clean Knife took this time to make his way over quietly, that light smile of his ever present.
“You’re a level 4 Law Warrior?” Clean Knife asked with a smile. “I really did not think I would get to meet you here.”
“If you could make it here, why couldn’t I?” Xia Fei retorted.
“That’s not what I mean. Others make it here in the Law Realm after being secretly chosen by the families and, afterward, go through any Heritage Planets’ tests, but you haven’t been chosen, nor have you made it through the Heritage route. You actually skipped through the stages and got here.”
Xia Fei was mildly stunned. “Does that mean you managed to make it past the fourth stage of your Heritage Planet?”
Xia Fei of course knew just how dangerous Heritage Planets were. If Clean Knife had truly made it past the fourth stage, then he would most likely be many times stronger than Xia Fei in terms of strength!
Clean Knife let out a bitter chuckle. “Nope. It’s been hundreds of years since anyone made it past the fourth stage, which is why the Law Realm changed the rules, such that even people who did not pass it but have the potential can end up here as well. These families ultimately have to inject new blood into their ranks, right? If they had stubbornly stuck to the rules of old, they would’ve probably met extinction already. I heard there are even those who personally make a trip to the Alliance just to pick saplings for nurturing.”
Xia Fei nodded. He had only cleared the test of Heritage Planet once. Unfortunately, the one he visited was a Heritage Planet which had long been abandoned, and there was no way for him to get to the second stage, so any hopes of clearing the fourth stage was basically impossible.
Heritage Planets were how the Law families chose their successors through the inheritance methods. Any family with the strength would establish a similar system in the Alliance, and the one that Xia Fei visited had long been left in disuse. It was likely because the family in question had long gone extinct from the Law Realm, which was why no one was left to take care of that inheritance system.
That was when the two elders of the Mu family returned to Xia Fei.
Mu Tielin intentionally coughed twice. “Xia Fei, we’ve sent someone over to the Yu family. Once we confirm your identity, we’ll have them send someone to pick you up. The major families in the Law Realm are of the same roots, so it’s only natural for us to look out for one another.”
Several minutes ago, the black-bearded and white goateed men were actually discussing if they should silence Xia Fei; now, they had had a complete 180 and were acting virtuous and upright. This change in attitude was so quick that anyone would have been left tongue-tied had they witnessed it!
“I wonder how you plan to deal with the carcass of the Demon Chrysalis…” Mu Tiehai suddenly asked.
Xia Fei was slightly surprised. Since this issue was raised, it must mean that this carcass had some value.
“Sell it off, of course,” replied Xia Fei casually.
Mu Tiehai was the impatient sort, which was why he immediately stated. “I’ll give you a hundred grade 3 Origin Crystals, and you can leave this carcass with us.”
A hundred grade 3 Origin Crystals would be a huge windfall to Xia Fei! Right now, Origin Crystals were precisely what he needed the most and lacked. Not only were they useful for his cultivation, they were Furball’s food as well. Here in the Law Realm, owning Origin Crystals meant owning everything!
However, Xia Fei was clueless about the true value of the carcass, so he had no idea just how much it was worth.
Frowning ever so slightly, Xia Fei probed. “Isn’t that price a little low?”
Mu Tiehai harrumphed, seeming somewhat dissatisfied. Beside him, Mu Tielin chuckled. “My brother was merely having a laugh. A Demon Chrysalis’s carcass will at least be worth a thousand grade 3 Origin Crystals, but your fight with the creature has ruined quite a bit of buildings here in the Mu family, so you should compensate us accordingly for them…
“Besides, the carcass of this Demon Chrysalis is very strange and desiccated as if its essence has been drained. That’s why four hundred grade 3 Origin Crystals should be a reasonable price.”
Xia Fei laughed. “Don’t forget; though this carcass was desiccated, it’s also one about to evolve.”
“About to evolve?!”
Mu Tiehai suddenly appeared beside the carcass, and after a careful examination, he nodded deeply toward Mu Tielin. “He’s right! This Demon Chrysalis was on the verge of evolving when it got killed!”



Chapter-524-The-First-Bucket-of-Gold
Chapter 524: The First Bucket of Gold 
Xia Fei had no idea just how much the carcass of a Demon Chrysalis was worth, and he had only been bargaining in accordance with his business acumen. Four hundred grade 3 Origin Crystals were quite a lot, and Xia Fei was actually elated at the offer, but he did not show a trace of his emotions outwardly.
“He’s right! This Demon Chrysalis was on the verge of evolving when it got killed!”
A series of gasps could be heard, and the expression on everyone’s faces changed greatly!
Xia Fei killing a Demon Chrysalis had been a shocking admission by itself, and it was even more so after it had been revealed that the Demon Chrysalis had been on the cusp of evolution!
Once a Demon Chrysalis evolved, the four wings on its back would promptly shrink, and six sharp claws would sprout, increasing its lethality by threefolds!
Xia Fei had struck at the perfect moment; had he allowed the Demon Chrysalis to finish its evolution, even if he had plenty of moves under his belt, he would have a tough time emerging victorious!
The teeth of the Demon Chrysalis could be used as material for weapons, and the thick chitin was material to create armor. The value was astronomical.
The value of an evolved Demon Chrysalis was of course even higher. If someone were to pull apart its abdomen, they would be able to retrieve a second form, which had not yet broken through. It must be mentioned that this was a completely intact body! It was very rare to come across something like this regularly, for there were not many of these evil Demon Chrysalides in the first place. There was only occasionally one or two that the Demon race would lose when they ventured into the wilds.
Unfortunately, the Blood Crystal had already drained the essence of the creature, only leaving behind an intact carcass, so the practical value plummeted as a result.
Mu Tielin gave this matter some thought before offering in a deep voice, “Since this Demon Chrysalis was on the cusp of evolving, it can be considered as a valuable material. After measuring its value, we of the Mu family are willing to pay eight hundred grade 3 Origin Crystals for it. What do you think?”
Xia Fei had a difficult expression etched on his face, muttering to himself, “Perhaps bringing this carcass back to the Yu family won’t be a bad idea, either…”
The Mu brothers were slightly stunned. The black-bearded Mu Tiehai appeared to be quite vexed. Eight hundred grade 3 Origin Crystals already seemed quite a high price for it. After all, this was a carcass devoid of even a drop of blood essence, and in terms of value, it was no more than a third of what it could have been with it.
“A thousand!” Mu Tielin raised his voice and offered. “This is already the best that the Mu family can offer.”
Xia Fei had been secretly observing the two old men’s reaction, so he knew that Mu Tielin was telling the truth, and a thousand grade 3 Origin Crystals were already their maximum limit.
“Done!” Xia Fei nodded.
“Oh, heavens! A thousand grade 3 Origin Crystals!” Phantom’s two eyes sparkled. “You’re rich now!”
…
The Mu family appeared to be in no hurry to inform the Yu family about Xia Fei and they had him stay around for two days, instead.
This was his first time out in the Law Realm, and he did not understand much about this part of space where these powerhouses gathered, so being able to move about here was not a bad thing. This was why he stayed around earnestly, following the disciples of the Mu family every day for cultivation and training while also looking around when he had the free time.
The Mu family stayed on a planet, unlike how the Yu family had everyone aboard a spacecraft, ferrying their million kinsmen through space.
It seemed like owning a super-size spacecraft was a privilege that only prominent families had. Though the Yu family was now in decline, they still had their golden days from before, which was why they owned such a huge spacecraft as their base.
Unlike the Yu family, the Mu family mainly cultivated the Law of Matter among the three Great Laws. Xia Fei saw the warriors engage in combat here, and it was a lot more direct and effective compared to the Law of Space. Even their level 1 Law Warriors were capable of demonstrating a decent combat power.
The Mu family specialized in trap setups, and their Law force allowed them to shape their terrain rapidly, burying some contraption amid the undisturbed land, awaiting specifically when their enemies would show up.
Such a fighting style was hardly considered direct, but it was very devious. Law Warriors familiar with the Law of Matter would be able to set up hundreds of contraptions and traps in the time it took to raise a hand, one after another, the next tighter than the last. Anyone who was unfamiliar with traps would have an extremely hard time escaping.
Clean Knife and Xia Fei had barely spoken ever since that time they met each other again. At most, they would exchange small talks, explaining to Xia Fei the profundity of the Law of Matter and such. In the two to three days there, Xia Fei’s desire to kill him slowly lessened.
It was as if the latter were a completely different person. Once Clean Knife no longer had to kill Xia Fei, he demonstrated his humorous side and was a lot more humble.
Xia Fei was careful to remain vigilant, though. In this foreign territory, no amount of precautions would be too much.
Three days later, someone from the Yu family came to the Mu family, and unexpectedly, it was Yu Hua.
Xia Fei was very curious about this. By right, Yu Hua had already sworn off familial matters, so why would Patriarch Yu Jiang rely on Yu Hua on so many things?
After meeting the two elders of the Mu family, Yu Hua exchanged some pleasantries and handed over some gifts before he took Xia Fei with him to a spatial door.
“Look, this spatial door is actually an enlarged version of the spatial compass. Not only can humans pass through it, plenty of goods can be transported across, too. Practically any family with strength to speak of will build one, just in case they need it from time to time. This time, we won’t be using the compass, and I’ll be taking you across the spatial gate.” Yu Hua pointed to the huge structure in front of him as he spoke.
Actually, even if Yu Hua did not use the spatial compass or the spatial gate, he could pass through space, for his cultivation was as high as a level 7 Law Emperor! He was only second to the family patriarch, Yu Jiang.
He had intentionally hidden the truth about his profound cultivation to Xia Fei, though the reason for doing so was still unknown as of now.
Xia Fei nodded. There was also a similar semicircular gate in the Yu family. Unfortunately, it cost money to travel through the gate and even required the family’s permission. Thus, he had yet the chance to try it.
The spatial gate was big, allowing even an entire contingent to pass through. There were strange patterns carved all over it, looking like they were derivations of the Law of Space.
This semicircular gate was a platform entirely made of metal, and Yu Hua stood right on top of it with Xia Fei.
“If you please.” Smiling, Yu Hua addressed the warrior who was operating the spatial gate to their side.
All of a sudden, the patterns on the gate began spinning clockwise!
It eventually picked up speed, and after several seconds, a glowing mass of light appeared within the confines of the gate.
Something began to take form before Xia Fei, and after the light stabilized, a mirror could be seen; both Yu Hua and he could see their reflections clearly on its surface.
“Okay, you two may pass,” announced the operator.
Yu Hua laughed politely, striding right into the gate. Like walking past a bead of water, the mirror surface rippled after he passed through before it regained stillness after a brief moment.
Xia Fei first tried to stick his leg in, only to discover that the spatial gate gave off no sensation. Beyond was also land, and where his foot landed had solid ground.
Curious, Xia Fei crossed the gate.
Like a thin sheet of paper, behind the mirror was actually the Yu family’s compound! That city he was so familiar with was not too far away in front of him!
Recalling that period of distance he needed to travel when using the spatial compass last time, the spatial gate was a lot more convenient. A single step was all it took no matter how great the distance between the two points.
“Spatial gates sure are amazing! It’s even faster than warp engines!” Phantom exclaimed in genuine surprise. “You can head to the ends of the universe with this thing!”
Xia Fei nodded, wondering if he could perhaps buy himself a similar gate. As such, he would be able to return to the Alliance freely, and seeing Avril would take no more than a few steps!
“Hmph! To think a cockroach like you would actually make your way back alive!” said Yu Qiqi irately with her arms folded. Beside her were the two female attendants whom Xia Fei had met before as well as a few middle-aged men with cold attitudes and seemed to be in the middle of heading out.
Xia Fei smiled slightly as he answered, “Sorry to have disappointed you.”
With that said, he made his way down with Yu Hua and did not even spare Yu Qiqi a second glance. These middle-aged men greeted Yu Hua as if they were already acquainted.
Such an attitude of sheer disregard pierced Yu Qiqi, and she soon pouted and jeered, “You’re nothing more than a little level 2 Law Warrior, so what’s there to be so smug about?”
Xia Fei turned around and extended four fingers, softly saying, “Not level 2, though I am a lowly level 4 Law Warrior.”
“Level 4!” Yu Qiqi and that group of middle-aged men were greatly surprised. It had merely been ten days since that battle in the collection reservoir. To have promoted two whole levels in such time, it was practically godspeed!
Xia Fei walked off without turning his head behind, and that infuriated Miss Yu Qiqi once again. She had never in her life been treated in such a dismissive manner, always ending up on the losing side of things every time she met Xia Fei. How preposterous was that?
“Miss, actually, Xia Fei is pretty amazing, and his promotion speed rivals that of Brother Xiaobei,” one of the female attendants whispered into Yu Qiqi’s ear.
“Tsk! How can Xia Fei compare to Brother Xiaobei? What’s the use of promoting so fast, anyway? The gap to make it to level 6 isn’t easy. The higher he jumps now, the greater his fall!” Yu Qiqi said through clenched teeth.
…
It was still the same pier by the river, and Xia Fei had once more come to meet with the family patriarch, Yu Jiang.
This time, Yu Jiang’s attitude had changed a lot after all that happened, and his eyes were even more eager than before.
“Xia Fei, oh Xia Fei, I looked up information in the Alliance about you and learned that you were never out of trouble, yet I never imagined that it would turn out like this.” Yu Jiang chuckled, his tone not at all sounding like he was reprimanding him.
As Xia Fei was confused, Yu Jiang continued. “You killed plenty of descendants in the collection reservoir, and those people all have parents and brothers. Being merciless when you act is a good thing, as this Law Realm doesn’t allow pity. Unfortunately, your foundation is shallow, making it easy for you to become a target to the masses”
Xia Fei softly replied, “They’re all enemies.”
“Does that mean enemies must all die?”
Xia Fei nodded firmly.
Yu Jiang burst out into laughter. “Able to be so decisive when it comes to murder means you’ll be a force to be reckoned with. Forget it. I’ve already suppressed all those who seek to bring you harm, so they won’t be causing any problem for now. Still, remember that this is just temporary.”
The topic then shifted, and Yu Jiang asked with a smile, “I heard that you had killed that Demon Chrysalis?”
“That’s right.”
“I’m very intrigued. Even if you do have a level 4 Law Warrior cultivation, that isn’t enough for you to slay a vicious adult Demon Chrysalis. Just how did you do it?” Yu Jiang asked with a twinkle in his eye.
Xia Fei had already guessed that he would have to field such a question, which was why he told them the story he had long crafted in his mind to explain what had happened.
He claimed that he had met an expert while in the gaps in space, and this person beat the Demon Chrysalis until it was close to death, so he was coincidentally given an opportunity to benefit off it. The point was that there was no way for anyone to verify what had really happened in the gaps in space, so Xia Fei could make up anything he wanted.
Yu Jiang and Yu Hua were of course unconvinced, but they could only laugh. They were helpless if Xia Fei did not wish to share with them what had truly happened. After all, Xia Fei was now no longer a cripple but rather a talented genius of the family who could be counted in one hand! It was easy to tell that he would be pivotal to the revitalization of the Yu family in the future, so there was no need for them to pry after Xia Fei’s affairs unless absolutely necessary.
Who in this realm did not have a secret or two of theirs living in the depths of their heart? It would be strange if Xia Fei had told them the truth plainly as tragedy would only befall anyone who lacked a scheming mind in this realm, which was fraught with danger in every corner.
After exchanging a few more words, Yu Jiang sent Xia Fei back, throwing out a line before his departure.
“Quickly return to your Roaring Tiger Park and take a look. It’s gotten very lively there now!”



Chapter-525-Roaring-Tiger-Parks-Business
Chapter 525: Roaring Tiger Park’s Business 
Once Xia Fei was gone, Yu Hua took his fishing rod and sat down with Yu Jiang.
“The Mu Family let Xia Fei come back just like that, and they even bought that corpse of the Demon Chrysalis at such a high price. Do you not find this unusual? Struggles in both the open and in the shadows have always been common in our circle. Rarely will someone give up on a chance to hit someone while they’re down,” Yu Hua said.
Yu Jiang coldly snorted. “They’re putting on a good face to us because they noticed that the Yu Clan isn’t in as bad of a state as rumored.
“In truth, it’s a good thing that Xia Fei accidentally intruded into the Mu Clan. Regardless of how he managed to kill that Demon Chrysalis, this is still an incredible matter to them. There’s no level 4 Law Warriors out there that are capable of such a feat.”
Yu Hua picked up where he left off. “So the Mus feels that our family still has some strength, and they bought the Demon Chrysalis’s corpse at a high price because they saw Xia Fei’s future potential?”
“Precisely. Xia Fei is very special! Even I can’t see through him.” Yu Jiang sighed. “It’s good to have secrets. As long as he serves us, we don’t need to ask him too many questions. The truth will come out in the future.”
Yu Hua nodded. “I suppose it’s for the best.”
…
Yu Jiang said that Roaring Tiger Park was very lively, but Xia Fei did not believe him. The park only had two exotic beasts, and each day was spent in idleness.
“Master!” Pod saw Xia Fei and rushed at him. “Master, you’re finally back! I’ve missed you these last few days!”
Xia Fei patted him on the head. “I missed you too. I had no other choice except to leave you with Furball because that place, collection reservoir, doesn’t permit exotic beasts inside.”
“Master came back at just the right time. Following your orders, I gave Furball one Origin Crystal each day, but Furball has eaten all ten of the crystals you left behind. It’s been hungry since yesterday,” Pod said.
Furball stayed in its cage and ignored Xia Fei, apparently sulking.
Xia Fei raised the blanket and threw three grade 2 Origin Crystals under it. “Here, I’ll give you triple the food today.”
Furball was the classic example of the saying: ‘Whoever provides milk is your mother’. The moment it saw the Origin Crystals, its eyes turned green, and it stopped being angry with Xia Fei and started feasting on those crystals, instead.
The Demon Chrysalis’s corpse had been exchanged for one thousand grade 3 Origin Crystals, so Xia Fei was not lacking in them, but he did not give any of these higher-grade crystals to Furball.
The future was long, and Xia Fei did not have a fixed revenue; letting his pet sit by and eat while idle, it would eventually run out of things to eat.
Furball had a wicked appetite, and once he tasted a grade 3 crystal, he would be unable to eat a crystal of a lower grade.
Best to prepare for a rainy day. In all things, it was better to plan for the long term.
After being fed, Furball coat of fur regained its luster. Xia Fei grabbed it and said to Pod, “Pack up this room. We’ll be moving to a new place tomorrow.”
Pod was cheering with joy. He had been like a chattering housemaid, always grumbling about how this room was too small and too dark, unhealthy for his body. Now that Xia Fei was a level 4 Law Warrior, his privileges had naturally increased. It was no longer proper for him to live in the disciples’ quarters, and the Yu family had assigned him his house in the city. He could get the keys tomorrow and move there.
As Xia Fei arrived with Furball at Roaring Tiger Park, he was greeted with a puzzling scene.
There were more than a dozen exotic beasts penned in cages here, and several people were waiting in the courtyard.
Upon seeing Xia Fei return, a woman of twenty-some years stood up and walked up to him.
“Are you the manager entrusted with Roaring Tiger Park?”
Xia Fei nodded. “Do you need me for something, Miss?”
“It’s not a big deal. I have a grade 7 Greenhorn Python that I’d like you to help me tame,” the woman forthrightly said.
Xia Fei frowned. Taming exotic beasts was naturally a small matter to him. He simply needed to use the Beast Spirit Codex and transfer information directly into their minds, and if that did not work, he could have Furball scare them a little. Even a high-grade Beast King would succumb, but how did so many people come to know that he could tame exotic beasts? Had it become known that he cultivated the Beast Spirit Codex?
“Miss, please wait a moment.”
Xia Fei waved a hand and called Yu Sansui over.
“What’s going on here?” Xia Fei asked.
Yu Sansui smiled. “In our Yu family, there are many people who raise exotic beasts. They are all Law Adepts who are troubled by exotic beasts which won’t listen to orders. They heard that you had tamed the two Beast Kings at Roaring Tiger Park, so they came to seek your aid.”
Xia Fei nodded. It seemed that the matter of the Beast Spirit Codex had not gotten out yet. If it was just helping them with training their exotic beasts, it was no big deal, a moment’s effort.
“That’s fine. I’ll wait in my room. Tell them to lead in their exotic beasts one by one,” Xia Fei said.
Yu Sansui pulled on Xia Fei. “How do you want to take your fee?”
“Fee?”
“Of course. It’s not like they can inconvenience you without a good cause. They have to at least pay you something.”
After seeing Xia Fei tame two Beast Kings with his two eyes and then seeing the frightening Yu Qiqi being beaten down, Yu Sansui decided that he would stop being enemies with Xia Fei, so his attitude was extremely respectful.
Besides, Xia Fei had risen four levels in a month! His genius reputation had spread both in and out of the Yu family, making Yu Sansui even less likely to mess around. On the contrary, he focused entirely on helping Xia Fei put Roaring Tiger Park in order.
He could make money from helping others tame exotic beasts? Xia Fei rejoiced internally.
If Xia Fei focused entirely on cultivation, he could use up ten grade 2 Origin Crystals a day, and this would only increase as he got stronger. There was also Furball. This fellow was still in his juvenile years, and for him to grow up faster required a significant amount of energy.
Besides that pitiful salary that Xia Fei received every month, he had no income. Even though he had one thousand grade 3 crystals in his spatial ring, he did not dare spend them recklessly. After all, he had a lot of places to spend this money. If he wanted to go back to the Alliance and see Avril frequently, he needed to buy the expensive spatial compass, and he needed to pay the fee for the spatial trip, too.
When he saw that miraculous Liquid War Armor, he wanted to buy a set, but the basic version of it cost one hundred grade 3 crystals. While this did not seem like a lot, it was not an amount Xia Fei could just squander away.
Thus, getting money in exchange for helping others tame their exotic beasts was a decent business. While there was little chance of getting filthy rich in one night, he could at least cover Furball’s eating expenses. There would even be a slight profit, which could serve as some sort of income.
Xia Fei nodded. “I truly should take a fee. What sort of price do you think they will accept?”
After all, Yu Sansui had grown up in the circle and was familiar with the wealth distribution in the clan. Thus, Xia Fei chose to ask his opinion first.
After considering the question for a bit, Yu Sansui said, “There’s a wealth disparity within the family, and those who raise exotic beasts are mostly not wealthy people. If you charge a high price, they won’t be able to pay. Why don’t you charge ten crystals as a base price, with one additional crystal for each rank. A rank 1 exotic beast will be eleven grade 2 crystals, rank 2 will be twelve, and so on. In this way, everyone will be able to pay.
“As for Beast Kings, we can’t do this. Those who raise Beast Kings are not ordinary individuals, nor will they care about spending some money to tame their beasts. I think that one hundred grade 2 crystals can be the starting price, with an additional ten crystals for each rank.”
Xia Fei felt that these prices made sense, so he nodded in agreement.
Once in the room, Xia Fei sat down while Furball rested on his shoulder. One controlled the Beast Spirit Codex while the other was a Holy beast who dominated the sea of stars. This sort of show of force could scare any exotic beast half to death.
Learning from how Furball’s roar of anger had almost wiped out Roaring Tiger Park last time, Xia Fei told Furball to remain silent for fear of him causing a homicide case.
In not much time at all, Xia Fei had an additional 137 second-grade Origin Crystals in his ring. With the sixteen he had before, he now had 153 second-grade Origin Crystals and one thousand third-grade crystals.
It was just over a hundred crystals in income, but it had to be understood that Xia Fei’s monthly salary was a measly fourteen, with an additional thirty for managing Roaring Tiger Park. Today, less than an hour’s work had gotten him three months of salary!
More importantly, this was not a one-time business. The Yu family had more than a million people, and the number of exotic beasts was beyond counting. Even if only one-tenth of them needed Xia Fei’s help to tame their beasts, it was still an impressive number.
Xia Fei gave two crystals each to Yu Sansui and the other assistants. All six of them benefitted, so they naturally had nothing to complain about, and all of them thanked Xia Fei.
The next day, two other people came to Xia Fei with their exotic beasts, and his reputation for taming exotic beasts began to spread.
…
Xia Fei’s residence was in the suburbs of the city. It was three single-story houses in a row, and the yard had a fiery-red crabapple tree and a white pear tree which formed a complimentary pair. It was small, but it did not lack for elegance.
Pod once more got to work. This diligent little fellow loved housework and cleaned up both the inside and the outside of the house. Perhaps because Avril was not at his side, Xia Fei felt like something was missing.
Xia Fei had a room on the left side cleaned up and made into a training chamber. He placed a black dagger on the ground and examined it, stroking his chin.
“The Blood Crystal seems to be getting colder and colder, a little different from before,” Phantom frowned and said, “Sharp, savage, and giving offan extraordinary aura!”
As this bloodthirsty dagger came from the Assassin Sect, Phantom was full of praise for it. He seemed to have forgotten that the one who assigned the Blood Crystal a new function was Xia Fei.
There was a faint red mark on the side of the blade which seemed to indicate the level of the Blood Crystal’s growth.
“About one-tenth,” Phantom muttered. “So you’ll have to kill nine more Demon Chrysalides to revive the Blood Crystal?”
Xia Fei replied, “Maybe, but I’m certainly not going to try and mess with those monsters. Last time, it was purely luck that Peacock Blue lent a helping hand, but there’s no guarantee about next time. I have yet to find a way to control Peacock Blue. Let’s put the matter of reviving the Blood Crystal to the side for now.”
He took out the three data storage devices from his spatial ring, and then a grade 3 Origin Crystal. Xia Fei took a deep breath.
These devices contained the Law of Energy Purification!
Energy Masters were the wealthiest and most brilliant existences in the Law Realm!
‘With energy in hand, the world is mine!’
Controlling energy meant a limitless future. After all, anything done here required the support of energy!
A mysterious pattern began taking form in his seventh brain region.
He had no guidance from anyone, so all he could do was feel his way forward.
Xia Fei was preparing for a brand-new experience, to challenge himself and become an Energy Master!
Of the more than one million people in the Yu family, Duba was the sole Energy Master.
This was proof enough of how difficult it was to become one!



Chapter-526-Plentiful-Peace-Hall
Chapter 526: Plentiful Peace Hall 
Drenched in sweat!
Xia Fei had known that learning the Law of Energy Purification would not be easy, but he had not expected it to be this difficult!
As the pattern took form in his seventh brain region, silver threads of energy began to weave to and fro like a butterfly dancing amid flowers, drawing out a profound and complex design.
At the start, none of this was too different from cultivating the Law of Space. Although the energy expenditure was high, this was no obstacle to Xia Fei.
When this pattern reached about one-fifth completion, the situation suddenly changed!
Those threads of energy began breaking free of Xia Fei’s control! It was as if some invisible power was preventing Xia Fei from forming the pattern.
This was not even the most difficult part. What was most difficult was that his body had become scalding hot, his body temperature rapidly rising. Xia Fei felt like he was in the middle of lava and his organs were burning!
His cells began to work faster, and sweat started seeping out of his forehead and from his armpits.
An immense pain caused Xia Fei to almost lose his mind!
Incredible endurance pushed Xia Fei forward, but just because he endured the pain did not mean that there was no pain. Excessively suppressing one wave of intense pain would only mean that the next wave was stronger!
His face went ghastly pale!
Xia Fei had no other choice except to stop cultivating.
Lighting a cigarette, Xia Fei undid his clothes to let himself cool down.
“This isn’t a question of endurance. I’m confident that no one in the path of cultivation has a tougher resolve than you. It feels like your method has been wrong from the very beginning,” Phantom said.
Xia Fei replied, “I understand that too. Using the wrong method to cultivate will often have one stray from the path, that’s why I stopped. It seems that it’s not for naught that Energy Masters are the most brilliant existences in the Law Realm. The Law of Energy Purification is clearly much more difficult to cultivate than the Law of Space or Law of Primal Chaos.
The Law of Space, the Law of Time, and the Law of Matter were known as the Three Great Laws!
There were several dozen levels to them. One started at a level 1 Law Warrior, and when one cultivated to level 9, one could advance to a Law Sovereign; after which, one had to work from level 1 Law Sovereign again until they became a Law Emperor.
The Law of Primal Chaos and Law of Energy Purification were considered special laws. There were nine levels in all, and at level 9, one’s cultivation was complete.
Not even the Law of Primal Chaos that Xia Fei had received from the Gods of Black and White had caused him this much pain when cultivating; the first Primal Chaos pattern had very naturally formed in his brain.
Of course, his attempts to cultivate to level 2 after had been at least ten times more difficult! Therefore, his speed had plunged.
Any law that was infused with primal chaos energy would be twisted, and one’s fighting power would be multiplied by two or three times. One might even be able to change the nature of matter itself!
Given how powerful the Law of Primal Chaos was, Xia Fei could accept the slow progress he was making with it. While he could at least make out the way ahead with the Law of Primal Chaos, he had actually made zero progress with the Law of Energy Purification at all. There was this fundamental difference between the two.
Phantom frowned. “I know of one method that can greatly lower the pain caused by the burning in your body, but the forming of the Law pattern will depend on your efforts.”
Xia Fei was stunned. That burning sensation alone had almost burned his body to ash. If there really was a way to lower his body temperature rapidly, that was a good thing. Currently, he had to deal with the two problems of managing his internal body temperature and the fine control of drawing the pattern. If he could resolve one, he had a chance—a chance to become a supreme Energy Master!
Without the heat worrying him, Xia Fei could entirely focus on forming the Law.
“Can you really control my body temperature?” Xia Fei hastily asked.
Phantom smugly smiled. “Why would I lie? I learned a drug-concocting method ten thousand times better than the one from my previous life from Sentinel Goddess Sophie’s databanks. Controlling body temperature is a minor matter for me.
“My method can be considered fine and delicate. If you can find an extremely cold place to cultivate, while the external temperature is very low, your insides will still be burning up. You won’t be able to resolve the problem of the heat produced from your cells working too quickly.
“If you take the drug I prescribe, your body’s temperature will remain identical to the external temperature without a problem.”
Xia Fei firmly nodded. He did not easily believe others, but he trusted Phantom entirely. After all, this unfortunate assassin had already become a part of him.
“Alright, we’ll go out shopping for the ingredients tomorrow!” Xia Fei declared.
…
The city Xia Fei resided in was built for basic Law Warriors to cultivate in. It was a small city with few stores. If he wanted to buy something actually, he would need to go to the Yu family’s main city.
The main city was home to six to seven hundred thousand people and congregated the vast majority of the clan’s resources. It was a modernized city in the truest sense, home to stores, amusement parks, libraries, theaters… It could even compare to the bustling cities found in the Alliance.
Still, the buildings here were rather interesting. Skyscrapers could be next to elegant old-fashion parks, and next to the parks could be a modern seven-story overpass.
The fusion of ancient and modern gave off an indescribably bizarre feeling.
Xia Fei had felt the same way when he had gone to the Mu family’s main city. It was as if the Law Realm was a place where the ancient and modern day were brought together.
The people of the Law Realm normally used energy bikes to get around. These bikes had smooth outer appearance like that of a beetle, and they came in different sizes. They relied on Origin Crystals for power, with a basic red stone able to power a bike for several months.
Xia Fei was a speed ability user, so he naturally did not need some method of transportation. To him, several hundred kilometers was the distance of a leisurely stroll, done in an instant. This was why so many people envied speed ability users. Distance essentially did not exist for them.
Apothecaries were an extremely ancient profession which also existed in the Law Realm, though there were few of them, and they were rather unremarkable existences.
But being unremarkable did not mean that apothecaries had a low status. After all, in the Law Realm, energy was in the mainstream. Making a living as an apothecary was extremely difficult, and one had to be extremely skilled to survive in the middle of energy masters and high-tech treatment centers.
Every apothecary of the Law Realm had their specialty, special skills that Origin Energy or modern medicine could not replace. Apothecaries were either complete unknowns, who spent their entire lives treating coughs and colds for the common folk, or heaven ascendants and masters of particular fields, who enjoyed both wealth and fame!
Xia Fei came to a small shabby four-story building in the city. This was the only medicinal ingredient store in the Yu family, and it was where several apothecaries saw patients.
The front courtyard was rather desolate. A golden signboard partially obscured by ivy declared that this place was called ‘Plentiful Peace Hall’.
Phantom pursed his lips. “To think that the apothecary profession had fallen so low in the Law Realm. My master Moonshadow is the most respected person in the sect precisely because his understanding of herbs is far more than an ordinary person can achieve.”
Xia Fei smiled and nonchalantly said, “This place isn’t the Alliance, and adepts rarely rely on drugs to advance. Instead, they use Origin Energy. Apothecaries can only serve as a support, so it’s understandable that their status is lower.”
Walking through the empty courtyard into the main lobby, he saw two old men chatting on a sofa. At the counter was a woman in her twenties, the only employee of Plentiful Peace Hall.
The old men glanced at Xia Fei as he came in. Few adepts in the Law Realm sought the aid of apothecaries, so Xia Fei’s appearance piqued their curiosity.
Xia Fei went up to the counter, and the woman behind it put down the magazine in her hand and calmly said, “Good sir, are you here to buy medicinal ingredients or seek consultation from an apothecary?”
Xia Fei replied, “Buying ingredients; I have a list.”
He took out his prepared list and handed it over. “If the names aren’t right, I’ve also added notes. Thank you for the trouble.”
Lightly stroking his spatial ring, Xia Fei took out a few fruits from Earth. “A small gift from my hometown. If you don’t want them, then please treat it as a mere jest.”
There was no problem with giving too many gifts. Xia Fei kept this principle no matter where he went, even when it came to buying medicinal ingredients.
The woman smiled sweetly. The candied fruits from Beijing’s Daoxiangcun had a tempting color, and all women liked eating snacks, this one being no exception. She naturally felt much friendlier to Xia Fei.
“Please wait a moment there. I will go to the storehouse to get the items you need.”
Xia Fei nodded and walked over to the sofa to wait.
There was a tea set and hot water on the coffee table. With nothing to do, Xia Fei brewed himself a pot of tieguanyin, sipping on it as he waited for his order to be filled.
Tieguanyin had a very thick aroma, and the two old men sitting on the side quickly sniffed it.
“What an alluring fragrance, strong and rich while not losing out on freshness. Kid, what tea is this?” A hawk-nosed old man peered over and asked.
“Tieguanyin, from my hometown. Would you two like to try some?”
“Oh, so you’re an Adept from the Alliance. Since it’s a product of your hometown, then we won’t stand on ceremony.”
The two elders invited Xia Fei to sit with them, and when Xia Fei heard that they were talking about pharmacology, he became very interested. He came over with the teapot and served the tea to them.
Tieguanyin had a very unique aroma, and the two elders were full of praise for it. Through their conversation, Xia Fei learned that these two men were called Zhuo Sen and Yu Kaixuan. They were both apothecaries, and because they did not have any business, they decided to sit and chat about a certain prescription.
After idly chatting for a while, the two apothecaries continued to discuss the problem that they had just been talking about, with Xia Fei listening on the side.
Let alone Phantom, even Xia Fei, a beginner when it came to pharmacology, could not stand to listen to them talk about this problem. If the method they were discussing were to be used to treat someone with a damaged seventh brain region, it was more likely to result in a kill than cure.
Xia Fei’s brain region had once been damaged, so he had a rather deep understanding of this field. In the field of medicine, it was not unheard of to use medicine that hurt as much as it helped, but it should not be used in such a haphazard and fantastical manner as they proposed, or else chaos would ensue.
“Gentlemen, the medicinal properties of the Hundred Pace Red is too fierce, and it’s not proper to mix it with the Sultan Grass. Why not exchange the Hundred Pace Red for seventy percent purity Small Net Red?”
Xia Fei spoke very politely, and the two elders were startled and began to ponder Xia Fei’s proposal.
Suddenly, an icy-cold voice came from behind them. “Hundred Pace Red switched out for Small Net Red extract? Are you trying to save someone or kill someone?”



Chapter-527-Do-you-have-a-license
Chapter 527: Do you have a license? 
“Hundred Pace Red switched out for Small Net Red extract? Are you trying to save someone or kill someone?” A cold and sinister voice sounded.
Xia Fei frowned and turned his head. He saw that the one who had spoken was a fatty with a rather fierce face. He appeared sixty-some years old and was squinting at him with a pair of triangular eyes.
“Switching out Hundred Pace Red for Small Net Red is naturally to save someone,” Xia Fei sternly replied.
“Hmph!” The fat old man swaggered his body over and sat across from Xia Fei. Zhuo Sen and Yu Kaixuan hastily bowed and then explained to Xia Fei, “This is the owner of Plentiful Peace Hall, Master Yu Youdu.”
Xia Fei gave a slight nod. He sincerely disliked this fatty and kept an aloof and cold attitude.
“Small Net Red is also known as ‘Ten Step Rapture,’ an indicator of just how strong its medicinal effects are. If you take 70% purity extract and mix it with the gentle Sultan Grass, the ferocity of the medicinal effect will be reduced by 70%, and what adept doesn’t have a tough body? This degree of medicinal strength is perfect.
“While Hundred Pace Red doesn’t seem to be as fierce as Small Net Red, there is no way of neutralizing it. Mixing it with Sultan Grass only strengthens the effect! Making it lethal medicine!”
Xia Fei ignored Yu Youdu, focusing on Zhuo Sen and Yu Kaixuan as he explained why the seemingly fiercer Small Net Red was a better choice than Hundred Pace Red.
His theory was practically sound, and it was in line with the style he learned from the Assassin Sect, which focused on maximizing the uses of ingredients to their limit. Phantom listened and repeatedly nodded his head in praise.
In truth, Xia Fei had a lot of talent in pharmacology. If he was not so focused on cultivation, he would have been able to become a rather excellent Apothecary. Phantom was absolutely certain of this.
Zhuo Sen and Yu Kaixuan found this explanation very reasonable and pensively lowered their heads. As for Yu Youdu, he coldly snorted and appeared very impatient.
“You there. Are you an Apothecary or something?” demanded Yu Youdu disdainfully.
Xia Fei raised an eyebrow and sternly said, “My name isn’t ‘You’. I’m Xia Fei, an adept, not an Apothecary.”
Yu Youdu seemed not to care, saying, “You there, since you’re not an Apothecary, what are you blabbering on about? This one is an experienced Apothecary. What are your credentials to participate in a discussion between apothecaries?”
“Credentials?” Xia Fei felt very indignant, coldly speaking. “An Apothecary is nothing more than a license. If you pass a test, you get the license, but that doesn’t mean that you actually meet the standards.”
Yu Youdu coldly laughed. “Why don’t I tell you what it means? If you can’t even pass the test for the Apothecary license, that just goes to show how pathetic you are. It means that you still don’t have the right to join discussions between apothecaries and that you still haven’t reached that level!
“Hundred Pace Red switched out for Small Net Red? Ridiculous! With so little knowledge, you dare to try and mess around in Plentiful Peace Hall? I feel embarrassed for you!”
Xia Fei felt like he had eaten a fly, and he could not stand the look on Yu Youdu’s accursed face. Phantom was even angrier. After all, Xia Fei had learned everything about pharmacology from him, and he scowled after hearing Yu Youdu demean all of his knowledge.
“Kill him!” Phantom gruffly said. “This arrogant scoundrel with all his nonsense dares to call himself an Apothecary? He brings shame on this hallowed profession!”
Phantom normally did not curse, but Yu Youdu had so provoked him that he no longer cared about being polite.
Xia Fei clenched his fists, but he then unclenched them.
“Forget it. If I kill someone like him, I’ll essentially have to wipe out a third of the world. He’ll understand the bitter consequences once he actually does use the Hundred Pace Red in his medicines.” Xia Fei felt that there was no meaning in arguing with Yu Youdu. Though he was angry, he had no plans of taking the man’s life.
Phantom stomped his foot and returned to his little home, presumably too angry for words.
At this time, the woman at the counter returned with the ingredients Xia Fei required, packed in a small box. Xia Fei went up to the counter to inspect the goods.
This was the Law Realm, and though Xia Fei some of the ingredients required that would be extremely rare in the Alliance, the little old Plentiful Peace Hall barely needed any effort to get them. This was a sign of just how abundant this place’s ingredient stockpile was.
“The quality of these goods are rather high, and as you are a major client, the price will be one hundred and sixty-five Tier 3 crystals. I’ve gotten rid of the remainder for you,” the woman smilingly said.
Xia Fei shrugged. While they had all the ingredients he wanted, the price was a bit on the expensive side.
He took out the crystals from his spatial ring and paid the bill. The woman’s eyes lit up. The sum she had quoted was not small, but Xia Fei had casually taken it out, and it was in hard cash. She wondered if Xia Fei was not one of those legendary wealthy scions.
“In truth, you can open an account at the union bank. The crystals can be stored there and will even generate interest. It also makes payment much easier,” the woman whispered. Perhaps because she had received snacks from Xia Fei, she treated him rather generously.
In truth, Xia Fei was no wealthy scion. It had taken him a great deal of effort to get these crystals. He had used three on cultivation, and he had now spent another 165 to buy these medicinal ingredients. He now had only 832 crystals left. As for the smattering of Tier 2 crystals, those were all Furball’s food.
“Mm, these ingredients aren’t bad. They should be enough to last you one week.” Just when Xia Fei was in pain over how many crystals he had just spent, Phantom suddenly spoke.
Truly, the one who did not manage the household had no idea how much firewood and rice cost. The medicinal ingredients he had bought for 165 Tier 3 crystals was only good for a week? There was no need to mention the depression in Xia Fei’s heart.
There was nothing to be done. Cultivating the Law of Energy Purification had to come at a price. If it was that easy to become an Energy Master, the streets would be full of them, and it would not have been such a revered profession in the Law Realm.
Putting away the package, Xia Fei prepared to leave.
At this moment, Yu Youdu suddenly smiled. He took out a card and placed it on the coffee table. Pointing at it, he said, “Go on, then. Get out of here. When you’re worthy enough to get the title of Apothecary, you can come back. If I’m happy, I may even teach you a thing or two.
“For now, you’re still not at a high enough level to talk to me.”
Xia Fei furrowed his brows. As the saying went, once or twice was fine, but thrice was once too much. Xia Fei was not planning to quarrel with him, but Yu Youdu’s repeated provocations were simply too much! It had exceeded Xia Fei’s patience!
Even saints had their breaking points, and when Xia Fei’s line was crossed, he would erupt without reservation!
Xia Fei sat down across from Yu Youdu, a smile on his face.
Yu Youdu continued to casually smile, refusing to look Xia Fei in the eye.
*Whoosh~*
Xia Fei grabbed the card on the table.
“Yu Youdu, level 3 Intermediate Apothecary,” Xia Fei coldly read out the words on the card.
Yu Youdu frowned. “Are you allowed to put your grungy hands on? Put it down already!”
*Pa!*
With a slight exertion of strength, that Apothecary license that Yu Youdu was so proud of, his precious treasure, was torn in two!
Three people, six eyes, stared at Xia Fei in shock.
Destroying an Apothecary’s license! This was an immense humiliation!
It was like smashing the sign of a dojo. This was undoubtedly a challenge from Xia Fei! A blatant one! Not even killing Yu Youdu was as bad!
A smirk on his lips, Xia Fei nonchalantly said, “Today, the license of level 3 Intermediate Apothecary Yu Youdu has been shredded.”
*Clack!*
Xia Fei threw the remnants of the metal card onto the table, and Yu Youdu frantically picked them up and tried to piece them back together.
Alas, the remnants of the license were not that easy to join together.
“Brat! You did that on purpose!” roared Yu Youdu, his complexion ashen.
“Yes, it’s on purpose.”
Messing with Xia Fei was futile. He had grown up on the streets and had seen every sort of hoodlum. The moment Xia Fei became unreasonable, no one could hope to take advantage of him.
“You, you, you stay right there! I’m going to settle this score with you!”
Xia Fei cracked his wrists, his finger joints clicking.
“Excellent. That’s exactly what I wanted.”
Yu Youdu paled. He was an Apothecary and knew no martial arts. When it came to brute strength, the three of them together were no match for Xia Fei.
Gritting his teeth, Yu Youdu spat, “Since you’ve destroyed my license, I presume that you want to compete with me in pharmacology. I’m going to find an elder in the Family to act as a referee!”
Xia Fei chuckled. “Whatever you say. Though you call yourself an Apothecary, do you have a license?”
Xia Fei was clearly the one who had snapped apart his Apothecary license, and now he was asking if Yu Youdu had one! Xia Fei was the lowliest of scoundrels, pouring salt on the wound!
Phantom laughed. “Alright! Compete with him! With me here, you can rest easy! Today, we’re going to mess up this ball of fat!”
…
Yu Youdu really did find an elder of the Family. This old fellow was called Yu Changgeng, and he appeared to be a relative of Yu Youdu.
In the Yu Family, the number of people running around with the Yu surname stood at one million at least, and anyone could be considered a relative to another in some sense. It was very normal for Yu Youdu to be able to invite an elder as a referee.
Two tables were laid out. Yu Youdu seemed intent on competing with Xia Fei.
Quite a few people came to see the show. In the Law Realm, Apothecary was an unpopular profession. A scene like this had never happened at Plentiful Peace Hall before, and so many people had never paid so much attention to an Apothecary. Many of the spectators did not even know what an Apothecary did.
Rather than saying that they had come to see an Apothecary, it was better to say that they had come to see Xia Fei. After all, it was already known throughout the family that Xia Fei had killed a Demon Chrysalis all by himself, leaving everyone shocked.
Besides that, Xia Fei had also tamed those two savage Beast Kings of Roaring Tiger Park, and he also had a seventh brain region that was 100% open. These various rumors made everyone curious.
Xia Fei acted like nothing was going on as he puffed on a cigarette. Suddenly, a smiling Yu Hua walked toward the crowd.
The moment people saw Yu Hua, they immediately greeted him and opened a path. They all appeared to respect and fear him.
Sitting down next to Xia Fei, Yu Hua asked, “You truly cause a lot of trouble. A Warrior quarreling with an Apothecary? What am I supposed to say about this?”
“He challenged me first,” said Xia Fei coolly.
Yu Hua’s eyes brightened. “Then Yu Youdu is your enemy, yes? Rather than killing him, you compete with him in drug concoction? This doesn’t match your style, does it?”
“Relax. He won’t survive,” Xia Fei casually said. “and it will be even more miserable than death.”



Chapter-528-Only-134-Seconds
Chapter 528: Only 134 Seconds 
“Relax, he won’t survive,” Xia Fei casually said.
Yu Hua was startled. He did not know where Xia Fei’s confidence was coming from, but he could not help but be amazed by his self-assured demeanor.
‘Could Xia Fei also be an Apothecary?’ Yu Hua wondered.
Apothecaries were in the minority at the Law Realm, but everyone knew that there were some things that only Apothecaries could do. For example, if an Adept damaged their seventh brain region while cultivating a Law, while the surrounding brain cells would not all die like in Xia Fei’s case, even a bit of damage would affect the adept’s cultivation progress and level.
After all, injuries to the seventh brain region were not like ordinary injuries and were very difficult to heal.
Those Apothecaries who could treat injuries of the seventh brain region were incredibly popular people in the Law Realm, comparable to the revered energy masters!
At this time, elder Yu Changgeng and Apothecary Yu Youdu walked over.
The Yu family had an Elder Court which consisted of nine elders. The head elder was Patriarch Yu Jiang, and Yu Changgeng was one of the elders possessing a high position in the Family.
Yu Hua and Yu Changgeng greeted each other, with the latter being very polite to the former. It seemed like all the members of the clan were on particularly good terms with this unscrupulous businessman.
“The rules of the contest will be like this: Over there is an Adept called Yu Lian. His seventh brain region is somewhat damaged. You and Youdu will give him medicines according to your prescribed methods. The one who can treat him will be the victor.
“Your quarrel arose from a prescription for a drug which can heal the seventh brain region, so I presume that there’s no problem with using this to determine the victor, yes?” Yu Changgeng asked.
Yu Youdu expressed his agreement. He had discussed these rules with Yu Changgeng already, so he naturally had no objection.
Xia Fei shook his head. “When an Apothecary gives medicine, they first have to guarantee that it has no side effects. If you’re giving a sick person medicine, you have to take it yourself first to show that it’s not poisonous.
“Make two servings. The first one we will drink ourselves to prove that it is not poisonous, and only then will we give it to someone else,” Xia Fei sternly said.
Everyone was shocked. Xia Fei was proposing that the two of them serve as test subjects for their concoctions!
If there was a problem with the medicine, the first to die would be the one who made it!
Yu Youdu laughed heartily. “As long as you stick with putting Small Net Red in your medicine, I guarantee that you won’t live to see tonight’s moon!”
Yu Youdu was incredibly confident in his prescription. Xia Fei’s proposal to test the medicine on themselves was exactly what he wanted.
Xia Fei indifferently retorted, “The moon? I can guarantee that you won’t live three minutes.”
Neither side was backing down, so it was best to let their medicines do the talking!
The two of them were both using lethal medicines in their prescriptions!
This testing of medicines on themselves would be a mortal confrontation!
…
Yu Changgeng announced the rules of the contest, and everyone thought that they were right. It made sense for Apothecaries to test their medicines on themselves, and no one could give a good argument against it.
However, from the tense looks on the faces of Xia Fei and Yu Youdu, the crowd speculated that there might be some hidden danger to this contest!
Xia Fei and Yu Youdu first inspected the patient, Yu Lian, and his damaged seventh brain region. The damage to the adept’s brain region was not serious and came from cultivating too much. It was much better compared to the former state of Xia Fei’s seventh brain region, and there was hope of healing it.
The signal was given for the Apothecaries to get to work.
Xia Fei was to the left, Yu Youdu to the right. Each with their tools, they began mixing their medicines.
Xia Fei did everything methodically: sorting, purifying, mixing, and stirring… Moreover, Xia Fei had an excellent grasp of time and was able to mix in new ingredients at any moment, his accuracy down to the microsecond.
Yu Youdu began to panic a little. It appeared that the licenseless Xia Fei was even more skilled than a licensed Apothecary. Was he really an Apothecary? Was he also skilled in the art of mixing medicines?
Yu Youdu did not have the skill to make a high-difficulty medicine which could completely repair the seventh brain region. If he had been this capable, he would have already been rich. The so-called prescription was really just a topic of idle conversation. None of them had actually succeeded with it.
However, Xia Fei was different. In order to repair his brain region, Xia Fei had tried all sorts of concoctions and was familiar with every sort of ingredient, so he was bursting with confidence! His attitude was relaxed and determined!
To those who did not know the truth, Xia Fei appeared to be the real Apothecary while Yu Youdu appeared somewhat fearful.
“I didn’t think that this cockroach knew how to make medicines!” said Yu Qiqi as she stood in the crowd with folded arms.
Yu Hua pointed to a sit next to him, indicating that she should sit down.
Yu Qiqi happily ran through the crowd and sat down next to Yu Hua. She sweetly smiled as she called him her uncle.
“Qiqi, you seem to have gotten prettier since we last met,” Yu Hua said.
Yu Qiqi proudly replied, “Haha, of course! Do you think that Xia Fei will die from his own medicine?”
“Do you very much hope for Xia Fei to die?”
Yu Qiqi firmly nodded. “Of course I do. I hate that cockroach. I’d like nothing more than to tear him apart myself!”
Yu Hua smiled and muttered to himself, “He probably won’t die that easily.”
“Why?” Yu Qiqi did not get it. “It’s not like he’s an Apothecary. Isn’t competing with a real Apothecary in terms of making medicine suicidal?”
Yu Hua replied, “You can’t just look at things on the surface. While Yu Youdu is a legitimate Apothecary, look at how nervous he is. He clearly isn’t confident in himself. As for Xia Fei, he looks confident and relaxed.
“If an Apothecary isn’t confident in his medicine, how can he convince others of it?”
Yu Qiqi frowned and spoke in disgust. “I hate how Xia Fei always looks like he doesn’t care. He doesn’t even look me straight in the eyes!”
As they were talking, Xia Fei finished mixing his medicine before Yu Youdu, and two bottles of faint yellow liquid were placed on the table.
Without even one second of hesitation, Xia Fei downed one of the bottles!
This was self-confidence!
Xia Fei was confident that there was no problem with his medicine!
Lighting a cigarette, Xia Fei sat down and waited.
This placed all the pressure on Yu Youdu’s shoulders. Xia Fei had already proven that there was nothing wrong with his mixture. Everyone was now looking at Yu Youdu in hopes of seeing the final result.
Pouring the liquid in the mixing vessel into two glass bottles, Yu Youdu was disconcerted. He just could not understand. Small Net Red had the fiercer medicinal effect, so why was Xia Fei fine? Was he really wrong?
His medicine was done mixing, but Yu Youdu was reluctant to drink it.
The spectators did not like this. Most of them had come to see a show, and Yu Youdu’s unwillingness to drink his medicine drew their ire.
“Are you good or not?”
“He’s already drunk his medicine; why haven’t you?”
“Is your mixture really lethal?” Various piercing cries rang out in the lobby. Yu Youdu turned pale, and sweat began to drip down his face.
“Why don’t we just end it there?” Elder Yu Changgeng was a distant relative of his, and even a fool could see that Yu Youdu was not confident in his mixture. Thus, he tried to persuade Yu Youdu into giving up.
Xia Fei snorted, muttering, “This is a licensed Apothecary? Very impressive.”
*Gulp!*
Provoked by Xia Fei, Yu Youdu drank the contents of one of his bottles.
Xia Fei did not wait for the result. Standing up, he began walking out.
“Where are you going?” asked Yu Hua with a smile. “How can you leave when the result isn’t even out yet?”
A smile on his lips, Xia Fei nonchalantly replied, “You best prepare his funeral. He still have 134 seconds left.”
The crowd hurriedly opened a path for him, and Xia Fei coolly walked out of Plentiful Peace Hall, leaving behind the gobsmacked crowd and a pale-faced Apothecary.
Some busybody had a timer, and the place was silent as everyone stared at level 3 Apothecary Yu Youdu.
10, 9, 8… 3, 2, 1.
As the counter ticked down, Yu Youdu’s eyes suddenly rolled over, and he collapsed to the ground, with froth coming out of his mouth while his entire body convulsed!
“Dead! He’s really dead!”
“It really was exactly as Xia Fei said!”
“Between Xia Fei and Yu Youdu, just who is the real Apothecary?”
The crowd chattered. The society of the Law Realm did not have much sentimentality. No one came up to worry over Yu Youdu. All they saw was a loser, and a loser’s death won no sympathy.
Yu Qiqi looked at Yu Hua with her mouth agape. She mumbled in shock, “He said that the man would die, and he really died? Xia Fei’s really maazing!”
Yu Hua furrowed his brows as he played around with a pill in his hand. He had intended to give it to Xia Fei, but since the loser was Yu Youdu, he naturally had no intention of wasting this precious pill.
“A brain region that is 100% open, Skywing Bloodline, and even an Apothecary?” Yu Hua softly mumbled. “Xia Fei is truly a rather interesting character.”
Everyone was focused on how Yu Youdu had died and in exactly the same way Xia Fei had said he would, down to the very second.
No one noticed a hand reaching out of the crowd and snatching away the bottle of light yellow medicine that Xia Fei had left on the table and then vanishing without a trace.
…
To Xia Fei, the medicine mixing was just a minor interlude that he paid little attention to.
With an expert like Phantom at his side, Xia Fei did not waste time actually studying pharmacology. He left this task to Phantom. In any case, Phantom had plenty of time, and their lives were linked to each other. Xia Fei would benefit if Phantom could meet with success in pharmacology.
His primary task was to resolve the problem with the Law of Energy Purification and get ever closer to the revered profession of Energy Master quickly!
Energy was money, cultivation, and power!
All of it required the support of a massive amount of energy!
Success in the Law Realm required passing through the trial of energy!
He had gone to great lengths to get the Law of Energy Purification. Xia Fei had no intention of giving up on this chance to become an Energy Master.
A silver bathtub was placed in the training room, and Xia Fei poured in the medical concoction.
“165 third-tier Origin Crystals! You could buy a system with that in the Alliance, but now I’m using it for a bath! Spending money? This is burning money!” Xia Fei said, mocking himself.
Phantom casually replied, “Once you become an Energy Master, won’t you have as many Origin Crystals as you want? Once you experience this medicine, you’ll change your opinion.”
Once water was poured in, the medicinal concoction became as blue as the sky.
Xia Fei thrust a hand in and found that the water was not cold. Actually, it was rather warm.
Taking off his clothes, he entered the bathtub. The temperature was just right, and he felt incredibly comfortable.
The warmth penetrated right into the marrow of his bones.
“You can start now. You’ll soon realize that this money isn’t wasted, and it’s more than worth it!” Phantom proudly proclaimed.
Xia Fei nodded and began, once more, forming the pattern of the Law of Energy Purification in his seventh brain region!



Chapter-529-Dark-Ghost
Chapter 529: Dark Ghost 
When the pattern for the Law of Energy Purification had reached one-fifth completion, that burning sensation emerged once more!
That lava-like temperature instantly set Xia Fei’s body aflame!
Phantom’s medical concoction began taking effect, and the gentle medicine swiftly neutralized the heat!
“Such a powerful medicinal effect!” Xia Fei murmured in shock.
His body maintained the appropriate temperature, neither too hot nor too cold. It was like taking a bath in the spring sunlight, so comfortable that Xia Fei wanted to shout.
Focusing his mind, Xia Fei began charging at the first level of the Law of Energy Purification!
His body no longer felt like it was burning, but the energy threads in his brain region were still difficult to control. They seemed to be rejecting him, refusing to follow his orders.
Xia Fei gritted his teeth and patiently tried again and again to control them.
…
As Xia Fei was trying to become an Energy Master, something that he could have never expected was quietly taking place.
A middle-aged man of forty-some years left Plentiful Peace Hall, with a slight panic on his face. This was because he had stored the brain region healing medicine that Xia Fei had mixed in his spatial ring.
As Law Adepts pursued power, they also accepted enormous risk. Excessive cultivation would damage their brains, with light injuries resulting in a massive drop in level, while serious injuries would take their lives.
For this reason, the brain-healing medicines mixed by Apothecaries became necessary and precious medicines that could easily fetch a price in the hundreds of Origin Crystals, allowing Apothecaries to reap a rich profit.
Even though they were expensive, Law Adepts still had to buy them, regardless of the costs. After all, the cost in money was nothing compared to damage to the brain.
In short, while brain-healing medicine was something very trivial to Xia Fei, it was extremely precious in the Law Realm.
What was the middle-aged man going to do with the medicine he had stolen?
After making several turns, he arrived at a rather extravagant residence. In the many cities of the Yu family, there were few residences like this one, and having one was a sign of illustrious status. This middle-aged man pushed open the door and went into the living room.
“Guhe, for what reason have you come to find me?” Another middle-aged man smiled as he walked into the living room.
Yu Guhe waved his hand, indicating that the man should close the door.
“Acting all mysterious, what are you trying to sell?”
“Brother Qinghe, this is a precious treasure for you!” said Yu Guhe proudly, though he kept his voice low and spoke in a mysterious tone.
Yu Qinghe and Yu Guhe were cousins, and they were famous local tyrants of the Yu Family.
Wherever people were, an underworld would exist. This Family had more than one million people, so there were naturally some involved in crime. The two brothers made a living off of selling banned drugs. Whether they were psychedelics or banned hormones used by Adepts, these two would be involved, and they were rather wealthy in the Family.
Relying on their uncle, who was a ranking elder in the Elder Court, Yu Qinghe and Yu Guhe prospered and were quite domineering.
“Do you know about medicines that can heal the brain?” Yu Guhe whispered.
Yu Qinghe was startled. “Who doesn’t know about such a thing? Hurry and talk! What are you on about?”
Yu Guhe smiled and recounted what had happened this morning at Plentiful Peace Hall.
Yu Qinghe sighed. “There’s something like that? A nameless little soldier compelled Yu Youdu to death?”
“He’s not exactly nameless. Xia Fei has some reputation in our family. Apparently, he killed a Demon Chrysalis all by himself, and his brain region is 100% open. He’s a rather promising seedling.
“It’s just that this kid is too incautious. When mixing this brain-healing medicine, he didn’t add in a blocker.”
Yu Qinghe asked in shock, “He didn’t add a blocker? Does he not know that if he doesn’t add a blocker, he’s essentially exposed the prescription, and others can just copy the process and make imitations. Isn’t this just a little too dumb?”
The Apothecaries always kept their recipes under wraps. Normally, in these circumstances, an Apothecary would add in a neutralizer to prevent others from obtaining the recipe to their medicines by analyzing the ingredients. This was normally called a blocker.
Xia Fei had not added a blocker in his medicine, meaning that anyone could analyze the contents of the medicine for its composition!
“Did you manage to get that brain-healing medicine without a blocker?” Yu Qinghe nervously asked.
An outstanding recipe meant business opportunity which translated to money!
As people frequently worked with hormones, Yu Qinghe and Yu Guhe were familiar with this line of business. If they could grasp the recipe to a brain-healing medicine, they would be able to make loads of money!
Yu Guhe smiled as he removed a glass bottle from his bosom and wagged it in front of Yu Qinghe. He smugly said, “This is the brain-healing liquid without a blocker. I was just in time for the show when I went to Plentiful Peace Hall to get some goods today, so I managed to steal it.”
On the surface, Plentiful Peace Hall was a pharmacy, but in reality, it was doing some illicit things in the shadows. After all, Apothecaries did not make that much in the Law Realm, so there were plenty of them who made their money through other means.
The Yu family regulated banned drugs very strictly, and not even drug pushers like Yu Qinghe and Yu Guhe were bold enough to import banned drugs through the spatial gate. Thus, they stashed their goods in the middle of Yu Youdu’s products. Today, as usual, Yu Guhe had gone over to get the goods, just in time to see Xia Fei and Yu Youdu competing against each other. His sharp intuition and his modicum of pharmacology knowledge allowed Yu Guhe to spot a business opportunity, so he had stolen the bottle and came back with it.
“There’s no time to lose. Let’s immediately go and find Dark Ghost. If this bottle of medicine is the real deal, we’ll be rich!” Yu Qinghe sternly said.
Dark Ghost was an illustrious Apothecary of the Law Realm, but his fame was not in his exquisite grasp of pharmacology. Rather, it was because he created hormones!
There were countless Adepts who died every year after taking too many hormones, and Dark Ghost was the one who gave them that push. Many Law Adepts had taken it upon themselves to eliminate this scum, but alas, Dark Ghost was too vigilant. He never stayed in any one place for too long, so no one had ever been able to catch him.
Yu Guhe and Yu Qinghe got their goods from Dark Ghost, so they had worked with him before.
Yu Guhe frowned. “Dark Ghost has a strange temperament, and he is actually Yu Youdu’s lover. If he learned that his love had been killed by Xia Fei, he might charge into the Yu family out of anger.”
Yu Qinghe patted him on the shoulder and casually said, “What’s the point in worrying about that? Xia Fei’s life has got nothing to do with us. We just need to have him analyze the medicine and start making money. He can do whatever he wants after that!”
Yu Guhe slapped his thigh. “That makes sense. A man will die for riches like a bird will die for food! As long as we have the brain-healing medicine recipe, at worst, we can just leave the Yu family. Brain-healing medicine is profitable no matter where we go. It’s decided then!”
…
A shabby and old-fashioned transport barge floated in space. The warship belonging to Yu Qinghe and Yu Guhe approached and quickly docked, and the two of them entered.
Whether it was the spatial gate or the Spatial Compass, they could carry passengers, but this would leave a trail. The two brothers had wandered randomly about before finally taking a ship here. If they directly used a compass, Dark Ghost would immediately kill the two of them without even batting an eye.
A bald man led the Yu brothers into a breakroom. On the way here, they could see many bottles of unrefined ingredients, many of Dark Ghost’s subordinates working away at them. There was an acrid stench in the air.
The bald man opened a door and roughly pushed the Yu brothers inside. In the center was an old man, his bare upper body covered in tattoos. Even his forehead and face had tattoos.
This was the infamous Dark Ghost, a black Apothecary who specialized in the production of hormones.
Dark Ghost was seated cross-legged, and upon seeing the Yu brothers, he unhappily sat up straight and said, “Didn’t I already say not to find me unless you had something for me? You could’ve just gone to Youdu.”
This love was somewhat blushworthy. Yu Youdu and Dark Ghost were both rather old, yet they were lovers. The thought of these two old men whispering sweet nothings into each other’s ears would truly be something else.
Yu Qinghe did not tell Dark Ghost about Yu Youdu’s death. He respectfully said, “Master Ghost, I have something to request of you.”
“What? Talk.”
Dark Ghost, who had a rather effeminate voice, was as savage and fierce as the rumors said. In truth, when together with Yu Youdu, he would often play the role of the bottom.
“I have here a bottle of brain-healing liquid without a blocker. We’d like you to see if it’s the real thing, and if it is real, can you extract the recipe?”
Dark Ghost chuckled. “Which Apothecary was it that carelessly forgot to add a blocker? Let me take a look.”
Yu Qinghe removed that bottle of light yellow liquid from the spatial ring and said, “The person is called Xia Fei. He’s a newly promoted Law Warrior of the Yu Clan, not an Apothecary.”
“Not an Apothecary, but he can concoct a brain-healing medicine!” Dark Ghost exclaimed. “Are you two pulling a fast one over on me?”
The Yu brothers smiled. “That is why we asked Master Ghost to take a look. We also doubt that this medicine is the real deal.”
Dark Ghost opened the bottle and sniffed it. “What a strange aroma! He used Crestmist Fruit and Small Net Red? Someone who dared concoct this is either a fool or madman! Someone even crazier than this old man? Interesting, interesting.”
The Yu brothers grimaced. “So you’re saying that it’s fake?”
Dark Ghost chuckled. “We would have to test it to know, but on these two sets of aroma alone, I can tell you that the one who made this is the maddest of madmen! Even I wouldn’t dare to drink such a vicious medicine.
“How old is that Xia Fei whom you speak of?”
“Age?” Yu Guhe pursed his lips. “He’s apparently twenty-two this year.”
“What?!” Dark Ghost’s eyes became extremely sharp and filled with surprise!
“Only twenty-two yet he dared to make such a crazy medicine? Regardless of what this medicine is, the liquid is full, the purity just right, and the color the proper shade. This is clearly the level of a master!”
Dark Ghost became excited, and he led the Yu brothers out of the room. “I’d like to see what sort of medicine such a young Apothecary could make, and why he would use such intense ingredients!”
They went to a room in which a strange and intricate machine was placed. It cost tens of thousands of grade 3 Origin Crystals!
Dark Ghost took out a reagent tube and dripped a few drops from the bottle into it; after which, he placed the tube in the high-speed centrifuge.
Several minutes later, a line of text appeared on the screen.
“A mild and gentle medicinal effect! It’s really a brain-healing medicine!” Dark Ghost excitedly said.
“A restoration strength of seventeen! It actually has 0.0017 restoration strength!” Dark Ghost exclaimed. “That kid’s a real genius! This medicine is comparable to high-level restoration medicines!”
The Yu brothers were over the moon with excitement. This was pure money!
Even a fool knew the value of high-level restoration medicines!
“Hurry and look at the recipe!” Yu Qinghe frantically said.
Dark Ghost nodded and activated the ingredient analysis system.
Plush!
No one expected what would happen next!
Smoke rose from this analysis machine worth tens of thousands of grade 3 Origin Crystals.
Destroyed!



Chapter-530-Dark-Ghosts-Fury
Chapter 530: Dark Ghost’s Fury 
Stupefied!
The room was so quiet one could hear a pin drop!
“It couldn’t be!” Dark Ghost finally managed to mumble in shock. “This is an NJ47 pharmacological analysis machine! A high-class intricate machine that cost sixty-five thousand grade 3 Origin Crystals for a single one! Just like that… it broke?!”
Yu Qinghe and Yu Guhe were also flabbergasted. They did not know a thing about pharmacological analysis, but Dark Ghost seemed to be implying that this machine was very formidable.
The profit for producing banned drugs was high, but sixty-five thousand grade 3 Origin Crystals was no small sum for Dark Ghost, and it would leave them in pain for a very long time.
Dark Ghost frowned as he messed around with the machine for some time. Ultimately, he sighed. “Ah! It’s really broken. The computation chip has completely burned out, and even the testing data has been completely wiped out. What sort of brain-healing liquid is in this bottle?!”
The loss of the machine hurt, but the loss of the data was what truly incensed Dark Ghost. After all, databanks were not built in a day. This was all experimental data! Even money could not buy it!
The Yu brothers cautiously asked, “Master Ghost, can the machine be repaired?”
Dark Ghost coldly glanced at them. “Replacing the chip is so expensive that it will be better to just buy a new one.”
The Yu brothers clicked their tongues. Sixty-five thousand grade 3 Origin Crystals! It was the entirety of the two brothers’ wealth! Even for the wealthy Yu family, it would still be a significant loss.
It just broke immediately? Was it a flaw with the machine or did it have something to do with Xia Fei’s recipe?
Dark Ghost grabbed Xia Fei’s bottle of light yellow fluid again and began examining it as well as smelling it.
“There’s no problem here! It’s definitely a bottle of brain-healing liquid. At most, the recipe should be strange and wild. Could it really be a problem with the machine?” Dark Ghost muttered to himself, his brows furrowing.
Yu Guhe was somewhat more cowardly, so upon seeing how dejected Dark Ghost was, he became uneasy and asked, “Master Ghost, it seems like Xia Fei’s medicine is too strange. Why don’t we forget about it?”
“Forget about it!?” Dark Ghost shrilly yelled. “Never! I’ve never seen medicine like this in my life! Daring to mix together several harmful ingredients, not even the maddest of madmen would do such a thing!
“You’re certain that this medicine didn’t have a blocker put in?” Dark Ghost asked.
Yu Guhe frantically replied, “I began watching him from the very first step. There truly was no blocker.”
Dark Ghost nodded. “Very well. Follow me!”
Dark Ghost led the Yu brothers to another room in the ship. This place was much quieter than the bustling upper floor and was more luxuriously decorated.
There were two large machines in the room, both extremely intricate and cleaned until they were shining. There were even three employees who were tasked with protecting and cleaning these machines. This was a sign of just how valuable they were.
“I spent all my life’s wealth on these hyper-accurate analysis machines. These are the best models in the circuit! There is no other competitor!” Dark Ghost proudly said.
Yu Qinghe asked in shock, “Master Ghost, these two machines seem extremely sharp. I presume that they are very expensive?”
“Naturally,” Dark Ghost proudly said, “they’re a hundred times more so than the previous machine. Even top-class families may be unable to buy such! They are my precious babies—the most important part of my private laboratory!”
The Yu brothers were alarmed. A hundred times more expensive? That would mean that these two machines both cost six million grade 3 Origin Crystals or more! Together, they cost at least ten million crystals. In terms of the grade 2 Origin Crystals, the most commonly used currency in the Law Realm, the price broke one billion!
Dark Ghost looked smugly at the shocked expressions on the Yu brothers’ faces. “I’ve nearly spent my entire life building this top-class laboratory. It can even compare to the facilities of the Apothecary Association. This is my way of proving to the world that even an underground Apothecary can be professional!”
The light yellow liquid was placed in the centrifuge.
The screen displayed the initial analysis the machine had on the medicine. The number was much more precise than the other machine. For example, the restoration value was placed at 17.859613, accurate down to six decimal places!
Using a machine to assess a medicine was extremely difficult, yet this machine was able to so accurately assess the medicinal effect. This was a clear sign of its precision!
“This is a product of the Fig Corporation,” Dark Ghost added, folding his arms.
The Yu brothers were stunned once more!
Fig’s headquarters was established in the God race, and it was known as the most advanced corporations in the Law Realm!
Be it Spatial Compasses, Liquid War Armor, or pharmacological analysis machines, that company always produced the most advanced models.
The most defining trait of the Fig Corporation’s product was that they were expensive!
Very, very expensive!
When comparing the same machine, an ordinary corporation might sell its product for one hundred crystals, but Fig Corporation would sell it for ten thousand, and it would not add a single extra function. If they did add a function, the price would be that much higher!
Though they were pricey, Fig Corporation’s products were still all the rage in the Law Realm. This was because the high price they commanded was a reflection of the fact that they were the most intricate and most advanced products on the market!
The Law Realm had clear class divisions, and a clan like the Yu Family did not have the money to buy Fig Corporation’s products. Only hegemonic existences like the Nine Great Families of Mankind had the ability to do so.
Dark Ghost probably had to use a lot of his connections to buy this pharmacological analysis machine.
Just when Dark Ghost was acting smug, a scene that would make one shatter their eyeglasses occurred!
After the machine started automatically analyzing the various components of the medicine, it suddenly let out a piercing wail!
It was like the cry of a beast being choked, low and shrill!
“Hurry and shut it off!”
Dark Ghost was so scared that his face turned white. If this machine was broken, it would be an extremely heavy blow to him!
An employee frantically cut off the power source; alas, it was too late.
The shrill sound slowly died away, and acrid smoke began pouring out of the machine.
The most advanced pharmacological analysis machine in the Law Realm.
Also destroyed!
…
Dark Ghost did not dare to believe his eyes. Even his precious baby had been destroyed? This was clearly not a problem with the machine but rather with Xia Fei’s medicine!
Appearing on the verge of tears, Dark Ghost collapsed onto the machine, so wracked by pain that it was a surprise that he did not fall unconscious. Veins bulged on his forehead.
“Which madman made this murderous medicine? It destroyed my baby! I’ll kill him! Kill him!” Dark Ghost raised his arm and madly raved.
The employees and the Yu brothers did not dare to make a noise, afraid that the unreasonable Dark Ghost would demand compensation.
In all honesty, if they had known that this was going to happen, the Yu brothers would not have given Dark Ghost Xia Fei’s medicine even if they died because of it.
Compensation? Not even if one took everything they had could they pay! This was the result of a lifetime of effort from Dark Ghost!
“I’ll kill him!” Dark Ghost’s eyes exploded with savage light. He pounded on an office table!
“I don’t believe it! Such a puny Law Warrior has made a medicine that could destroy machines!”
Dark Ghost was so angry that he was somewhat deranged. As a top-class underground Apothecary who produced hormones, Dark Ghost had talents that could not be doubted.
If he had not been so obsessed with the drugs that the Law Realm specifically banned, Dark Ghost would probably be the next candidate for president of the Apothecary Association.
He had analyzed countless recipes before, and this was precisely why so many Apothecaries considered him a mortal foe!
Making forbidden drugs was naturally illegal, but Dark Ghost’s original sin was offending all his peers, thus making it so that no place in the Law Realm was safe for him. Manufacturing hormones? That was just an excuse! Hatred was the real reason!
When a man went mad, he could do anything. Dark Ghost grabbed Xia Fei’s concoction and went to the other machine, also a Fig product, a top-class pharmacological analysis machine. This one was even newer and more expensive!
“Start it up! Analyze this medicine for me! I want to see what’s so weird about this medicine! Accursed Xia Fei, I’ll show you!”
Dark Ghost’s eyes had gone red! He madly yelled at the machine.
A machine was still a machine. It could not understand Dark Ghost’s words and dutifully executed its orders. At the same time, when the most intricate machine encountered a situation it could not understand, it would break!
*Rumble!*
This machine’s reaction made even less sense. It did not start smoking, nor did it let out a screeching howl. It simply exploded!
Fortunately, due to its thick alloy shell, the internal explosion of the machine did not hurt anyone, but this could not prevent the earth-shaking shockwave!
Thick black smoke plumed!
The room’s fire suppression systems detected smoke and automatically activated.
White foam poured in from the ceiling, drenching Dark Ghost, the Yu brothers, and the three employees, leaving them in miserable states!
“I won’t accept this! I won’t!”
Dark Ghost yelled out with a mouthful of foam. His body and head were covered in white foam, making him look like Santa Claus.
The Yu brothers trembled, not daring to even breathe, and they simply stood in the foam.
Dark Ghost was an illustrious underground apothecary of the Law Realm.
It wasn’t because he himself was so terrifying and powerful, but because of the powerful soldiers under his command!
Apothecaries, just like energy masters, could get a lot of human capital once they were at a high enough rank. Without needing to do anything themselves besides send a letter, they could recruit many elite warriors. After all, these warriors relied on them for the most part. It was a mutually beneficial relationship.
Dark Ghost had gone insane! He was furious! It was clear that someone was going to die for this, and he had the men and power to make anyone die!
Xia Fei was no fool. The reason Dark Ghost had been given such a heavy blow was that he had treated Xia Fei like a fool.
A brain-healing liquid without a blocker? Xia Fei would never do something so unprofessional!
As had been proved countless times, anyone who treated Xia Fei like a fool would end up being the true fool!
*Bang!*
Dark Ghost kicked open the door as he howled Xia Fei’s name. He had put all the blame on Xia Fei.
At this moment, a bald man came to the door. Seeing Dark Ghost covered in foam, the man frowned. He wanted to laugh, but he did not dare to do so.
“Master Ghost, our spies have reported that Yu Youdu is dead,” the man sternly reported.
“Dead? How did he die?!” Dark Ghost paled. Today seemed to be an extremely bad one for him. His machines had broken, and his lover was dead! What was there to say?
“Apparently, he was compelled to death by an Adept of the Yu family called Xia Fei.”
“Xia Fei? Xia Fei!
“How is it him again?!”



Chapter-531-Battle-at-the-Summit
Chapter 531: Battle at the Summit! 
In the training room, the fragrance gradually receded, and the blue medicinal liquid in the bathtub lost its luster, becoming a little different from regular water.
Xia Fei sighed and rose from the bathtub. He dried his body and put on his clothes.
“It’s still far away. Although the medicinal liquid can stop the heat waves in my body, it can’t make those restless energy threads in the seventh brain region listen. Let’s change medicines and try again,” Phantom helplessly said.
It had been three days, but Xia Fei had still not made any progress in cultivating the Law of Energy Purification.
The medicine worth 165 grade 3 Origin Crystals had not lasted the week Phantom said. After three days, it had been all used up.
This was adding insult to injury. Xia Fei had no other choice except to consider where he might have gone wrong.
“It seems that becoming an Energy Master isn’t as easy as I thought.”
Phantom comforted Xia Fei. “You don’t have a master, and even when doing things on your own, you managed to get to 50% completion in the first level of the Law of Energy Purification. This is already very surprising. There’s no need to blame yourself.”
“I’m still lacking some sort of insight,” Xia Fei muttered to himself. “The Law of Energy Purification is different from the Law of Space or the Law of Primal Chaos. It doesn’t seem to belong to the same system at all, so my past experience won’t be of any help. I’ll have to re-experience the profundities of this law.”
His efforts were truly admirable, but Xia Fei had noticed that something was not right. In order to cultivate the Law of Energy Purification, one had to experience and comprehend it!
In the living room, Pod saw Xia Fei and hastily went to make his favorite fried paste noodles, but Xia Fei was not in the mood to eat. After feeding Furball two Origin Crystals, Xia Fei decided to take a midnight stroll.
Furball immediately jumped onto his shoulder. Now that he was full, Furball felt like it was the perfect time to curry some favor with his owner, so he began to nuzzle Xia Fei’s neck.
Xia Fei smiled and left the city with Furball for the wilderness.
In truth, while the Yu family resided on a warship, this warship was the size of a planet and played host to all kinds of gorgeous sceneries. Xia Fei had not been to many of these places, so he decided to go on some sightseeing and alleviate his bad mood.
Distance presented no problem for a speed ability user, and by the time Xia Fei came back to his senses, he was very far from the city atop a verdant mountain.
The sides of the mountain were steep, and the summit was a rock like a giant millstone. With nothing else to do, Xia Fei climbed the summit and looked up at the stars.
Xia Fei had been very curious ever since he was a child, and he liked looking up at the stars and wondering what was out there. This was a habit that he still had.
Xia Fei always found this artificial moon strange, inferior to the natural river of stars behind it.
Suddenly, he felt strong gales on all sides!
“Someone’s here!” Phantom sternly said.
“I know.”
Xia Fei did not care too much. There were around a million people in the Yu family, so there might have been a few people like him who had found it hard to sleep and decided to take a nighttime stroll.
The Yu family had a public safety division, and it had always kept the place very safe.
*Whoosh~*
A black figure swiftly moved up behind Xia Fei.
“You are Xia Fei? The new Law Adept?” that man sternly said.
Xia Fei turned his head and saw a big bald man wearing a dark combat uniform, coldly staring at him. His head was tattooed, and his bald head gleamed under the starlight.
“I am,” Xia Fei casually replied.
“Master Ghost seeks your presence. He has some matters that he wishes to discuss with you,” the baldy sternly said.
Xia Fei softly laughed. “Master Ghost? I know of a ghost, but nothing of this Master Ghost.”
The baldy slightly creased his brows. The ghost Xia Fei spoke of was naturally Phantom, but the man simply took this as disrespect to Dark Ghost.
“Once you go, you will naturally know of Master Ghost.”
“And if I don’t want to go?” Xia Fei asked.
“Then I will have to invite you to go.”
The baldy emphasized the word ‘invite’, seemingly threatening Xia Fei.
Threat?
Xia Fei had a bellyful of anger with nowhere to vent it. He wanted someone to threaten, and this baldy was threatening him?
“Anyone who wants to see me should come himself. If not, they can scram,” Xia Fei rudely said.
The baldy snorted. He had already learned from the Yu brothers that this Xia Fei was only a level 4 Law Warrior. A puny level 4 warrior dared to act so domineering? If not for Dark Ghost’s orders to capture him alive, he would already beat this fellow up.
However, Furball on Xia Fei’s shoulder left the man alarmed. Although he did not know what sort of creature Furball was, that sharp gaze could only belong to a high-grade exotic beast. Moreover, it was so arrogant that it did not even bother glancing at him.
“It seems like the exotic beast and the master are the same,” the bald man said to himself.
He waved his hand, and six more men in black appeared, surrounding Xia Fei.
Furball suddenly let out an untimely laugh. It was obvious that these people intended to encircle Xia Fei, but Furball clearly did not care.
Frowning, the baldy grunted. “Take him away! Hurry up already!”
“Yes!”
The six men charged up, and at the same time, Xia Fei lunged at them!
It was clear that these six planned to close in on Xia Fei like a net!
Xia Fei sought to break out of the net!
He would not permit himself to be placed in a passive position!
Perhaps because he was a new Law Adept, so he was not particularly well regarded in the Law Realm, but a newly promoted Law Warrior did not mean a lack of experience!
It had to be understood that Xia Fei had been killing since he was in his teens! He had experienced far too many battles!
The moment his enemies began to move out, Xia Fei had already predicted what their next move would be!
“Counterattack!” the baldy exclaimed.
In these circumstances, an inexperienced fighter who was outnumbered would choose to stay in place rather than charging in, but that would ensure that they lost the upper hand.
The six Law Warriors he had brought were not very powerful, with an average strength of level 7. They were experts in encirclement, using the Laws of Space and Matter together, such that even a Law Elder would find it hard to break out.
While Xia Fei’s choice to attack rather than defend seemed impulsive, it was actually the best way to break out!
It appeared that his decision-making ability was not weak. It could even be very strong!
Wildstorm!
His first attack was a violent and brutal technique!
Xia Fei used his speed to rush up to his first foe and swung his fist at him!
Xia Fei cared little for why these people wanted to catch him.
What was important was that he was angry and wanted to fight someone!
These people had delivered themselves to him!
Encirclement required every member to be in sync. Xia Fei did not wait for his foes to attack, going on a frenzied offense from the very start to upset his enemies’ plans!
*Bang!*
The fist infused with the power of Law of Primal Chaos was abnormally violent, and before this Law Warrior knew what was going on, he had already sent flying.
*Crack!*
Bones broke and muscles snapped!
No mercy!
One strike to take a life!
Xia Fei busted a hole through the encirclement!
Xia Fei moved again. He was very skilled in combining his speed ability with his Law energy. He knew that the Laws were his weapon, and when combined with his bizarre movement techniques, he could produce surprising results!
He walked out horizontally, a truly bizarre and flabbergasting way to move. At this moment, these warriors came to know that one could actually walk horizontally!
“Chain Blockade!”
Xia Fei was moving in an unreasonable fashion, and the move he used was even more unreasonable!
“Iron Wall!”
The Law Adept in front of him reacted rather quickly, using the Law of Matter to instantly construct a metal wall!
The metal in the soil instantly gathered together into a steel wall to stop Xia Fei!
*Rumble!*
The Chain Blockade technique Xia Fei had just used, which was designed to tear away at space, was different in that it carried warping power!
Three frenzied tornadoes tore apart the metal wall! As easily as a monster’s claws tore at the corpse of an enemy!
The metal wall had not been able to stop the tearing force, but it dropped its speed and weakened its power.
Another Law Adept rejoiced and set up a spatial wall, telling himself, “A single attack shouldn’t be able to break through both Laws of Matter and Space defenses, right?”
Rumble!
When Xia Fei’s spatial fissure collided against the spatial wall, it created a massive boom!
Because of the wall created from the Law of Matter, the tornadoes had no choice except to stop.
The Adept became slightly smug.
Alas, while the spatial tear had stopped, Xia Fei had not!
“Break for me!”
Xia Fei roared! Holding October Flying Snow in his hand, he punched at the spatial wall!
His fist blasted through the wall and struck the man right in the forehead!
*Bang!*
The person’s brain cracked open!
White and red flesh splattered across the summit!
The punch did not stop there. There was another Adept behind him who used the Law of Matter, but before he could react, a silver dagger swept across his neck!
Fast! Sharp! Not even leaving behind a single wound!
*Crack!*
Xia Fei flicked his fingers, sending the man’s head flying off like a ball!
All of this took mere seconds. The encirclement of six had halved its number in the blink of an eye!
“Feels good!”
Once Xia Fei got going, he would not stop, not until all his enemies were dead!
The six-man encirclement had been broken, and there was no way the remaining three would be any match for Xia Fei!
*Bang!*
The last Law Adept took a Wildstorm punch straight to the chest!
His depression had been completely swept away. Xia Fei stared at the bald man several dozen meters away. Furball felt tired, and all he had done throughout was simply watch Xia Fei. In his view, these foes were not worthy of his power.
“Such a violent fist technique,” the baldy said with a hearty laugh. “It seems like I’ve underestimated you. Although you’re only level 4, you have first-class combat strength among your peers. Of course, your speed ability also plays a big role in allowing you to make surprise attacks.
“However, what I’m most interested in is those spatial tears of yours. It seems to contain some unique energy. Can you tell me what it is?”
He was naturally referring to the Law of Primal Chaos. The special reversal properties of this law had been developed by the God race, and humans had no understanding of it.
Xia Fei was not so foolish to reveal the secret of the Law of Primal Chaos.
Suddenly, there was a flash of lightning in the distance. Xia Fei smiled. “The Yu family guards have already noticed your intrusion. It seems to me that you need to think about how to get out of here in one piece.”
The baldy coldly laughed. “The Yu family? I can go wherever I want. Nobody should even think about trying to stop me.
“Come on. Let me see what sort of power you’re using!”
He suddenly disappeared, and when he next appeared, he was right in front of Xia Fei!
His right hand crackled with lightning! Blue sparks of electricity leaked out from between his fingers!
“Instant movement!” Xia Fei mentally exclaimed.
The baldy’s hand thrust like a knife at Xia Fei’s heart!



Chapter-532-Law-Emperor-Yu-Hua
Chapter 532: Law Emperor Yu Hua 
Instant movement was no simple technique. It required a precise grasp of the Law of Space; it also required the fastest control of constructing and collapsing a spatial barrier. Without the cultivation of a Law Sovereign, even with the best of talents, one would find it very hard to pull off this technique successfully.
Given that this man could instantly appear at Xia Fei’s side so easily, he clearly had a high level of cultivation. It must be understood that the distance between him and Xia Fei was less than one hundred meters, and the closer the distance, the harder it was to use instant movement!
The bald man’s hand thrust like a knife at Xia Fei’s heart!
The fingers crackled with blue lightning. This was not the power of any law, but the man’s ability: lightning!
“Shift!”
The Dragonscale Hectoslasher suddenly transformed into a giant saber which swung out horizontally to block the path of the man’s thrusting hand!
*Bang!*
As the bald man’s hand struck Xia Fei’s saber, there was a massive explosion!
Electricity coursed through Xia Fei’s body as if he had been struck by lightning, and the hair on his head stood on end! Every inch of his muscles ached!
Xia Fei’s body was forced back one hundred steps. His feet were buried into the rocks, leaving two deep furrows in the ground!
“Your reaction’s rather fast. A pity you didn’t use a spatial screen; otherwise, the electricity would’ve found it difficult to wound you!” the bald man coldly said. He was implying that he had not used his full strength and had just attacked to test Xia Fei’s cultivation.
Xia Fei did not answer. He bent his body, appearing like a tree being battered by the wind. He leaned his body toward the ground while his legs began to bend slightly as he built up power.
The bald man was startled. In this state, Xia Fei was clearly building up power for a counterattack. He had gone easy on Xia Fei moments ago, but he had not imagined that Xia Fei would still refuse to concede.
“Furball!”
*Bang bang bang!*
Furball had already been waiting, and as soon as Xia Fei gave the order, it spat out more than a dozen energy balls. Like a cannon installed on Xia Fei’s shoulder, it unleashed a continuous salvo!
Furball’s attacks could convert matter into energy. The bald man realized that something was strange about it, so it did not dare to take the attack directly and, instead, dodged quickly.
“Chain Blockade!”
His movements had some order to them, and Xia Fei spotted a break between his dodges and unleashed his spatial tears!
This was not the end of his attack yet. Xia Fei unleashed the accumulated power in his body and charged forward!
Three layers of attacks!
The first layer was Furball’s white cannonball fire, the second layer was the spatial tears, and the third layer was Xia Fei’s Sly Thrust!
It was like the waves beating on the shore!
Even if he dodged the first layer, there was still a second and a third!
Each one was fatal!
This was the style Xia Fei had developed after far too many battles: wave attacking!
The bald man assumed a fighting stance, and a round shield suddenly appeared in his right hand!
“A Law weapon!”
Many of the weapons used in the Law Realm had Law force attached to them. A true master simply needed to add Law force to ordinary weapons when creating Law weapons and they could sell for astronomical prices! This was one of the paths to prosperity.
After all, the most numerous in this realm were the low-ranking Law Warriors. They could go their entire lives without reaching a higher rank. Once they had a Law weapon created by a high-ranking warrior, they could greatly increase their fighting power!
Of course, granting a weapon Law force was not easy but rather required a specific technique. Thus, they were few in number and extremely expensive.
*Rumble!*
A multicolored light flew through the air.
A bronze wall appeared around the round shield, dispersing Xia Fei’s attack!
*Bang!*
There was another boom!
Xia Fei’s iron fist arrived!
There was clearly a metal shield in front of him, and Xia Fei knew that he could not hit his foe’s body, but he still punched without hesitation!
The bald man’s entire body was forced back one hundred meters! Such was the power of this punch!
The spatial barrier around the round shield instantly shuddered!
The Law of Primal Chaos’s energy infused in Wildstorm was just that powerful!
The two once more assumed fighting positions. Using his lightning ability, the bald man could push back Xia Fei one hundred meters; upon which, Xia Fei would use his Law of Primal Chaos to return the blow in kind and send his opponent flying!
The bald man’s eyes were brimming with shock. He found it hard to believe that Xia Fei’s counterattack would be this powerful!
“So strong!” the bald man sternly said. “This can’t merely be the Law of Space!”
Xia Fei did not answer. He took out a grade 3 Origin Crystal to replenish his energy. While his combination attack was very strong, it consumed a lot of energy.
He slowly unclenched his fist, and a fiery pain spread across his body.
The defense was very strong. Xia Fei could break the defenses of a Demon Chrysalis, but even his full strength could not break this shield!
This Law weapon was clearly a much higher rank than the Lapis Killing Rain.
The sounds of fighting from below gradually grew louder. It was clear that the baldy had not come alone. His subordinates were already fighting the Yu family’s guards.
Glancing down the mountain, Xia Fei saw that there were over fifty black-clothed men battling with the first squad of guards, and both sides were evenly matched.
“Yuan Dian, Master Ghost is getting impatient. Hurry up a little.”
A voice came from the sky, and Xia Fei looked up and saw a man wearing a white cloak standing several hundred meters above him, coldly looking down at them.
“Mu Linbai, don’t go interfering in this old man’s business! I’ll do what I want!” the baldy, Yuan Dian, coldly grunted. The two of them did not seem to like each other.
The white-clothed Mu Linbai shrugged. “Whatever. In any case, you’re the one who will have to take the punishment from Master Ghost.”
With these words, Mu Linbai waved his sleeve and vanished.
Xia Fei frowned as he mentally grumbled. What sort of god had he offended that so many experts wanted to capture him?
Yuan Dian furiously said, “The time is up! Come with me!”
Xia Fei’s full-strength attack had caught Yuan Dian by surprise. His eyes now turned sharp and vicious, his patience completely spent!
*Whoosh~*
Yuan Dian instantly appeared at Xia Fei’s side, his hands pinching Xia Fei from the sides like steel tongs!
“Crafty Approach!”
Xia Fei suddenly crouched, avoiding Yuan Dian by moving under his armpit!
*Bang!*
An invisible wall locked down on Xia Fei’s current location. Yuan Dian had used the power of the Law of Space to block off the surroundings! Xia Fei could no longer use his speed ability!
With his lips curving into a savage smile, Yuan Dian turned his hand around and made a grab of him again!
*Smack!*
His hand seized Xia Fei’s left arm, and a powerful electric current instantly flowed to every cell in his body.
During moments of danger, a man would instinctively make a conditioned reflex.
Xia Fei’s instinctive reaction was to use the Law of Primal Chaos to protect his body.
That strange and abstruse pattern immediately formed within his seventh brain region, and then something shocking took place!
The powerful electric current, which was in the middle of flowing through Xia Fei, following the Law energy’s emergence, suddenly reversed and attacked the one who had unleashed it!
*Bang!*
The summit shuddered!
Yuan Dian was injured by his own electric current, and he was sent flying, his eyes brimming with shock!
The one who had released the ability not only failed to injure his foe, but he had been hurt by the backlash, too!
There was no reasoning that could explain this. It was far too bizarre!
“A chance!” Invigorated, Xia Fei took out a bloodthirsty dagger, the Blood Crystal.
Xia Fei stepped forward and floated forward like a ghost, his dagger stabbing at Yuan Dian.
“Sly Thrust!”
The Blood Crystal would suck away at his foe’s essence blood, crazily devouring it!
Yuan Dian, who was suffering from the backlash of his special ability, had been deprived of his defenses, so the Blood Crystal could stab him without resistance.
Once this bloodthirsty dagger was in, Yuan Dian would have no other choice but to die!
*Whoosh~*
Yuan Dian, who had been thrown back horizontally, suddenly flew upward as if someone was carrying him.
The Blood Crystal swept past his body and only left a wound on his leg. It was unable to devour his blood.
Looking up, Xia Fei saw that Mu Linbai had appeared, and the injured Yuan Dian was held under his armpit.
After shooting Xia Fei a confused glance, Mu Linbai disappeared into the darkness of the night with Yuan Dian.
Less than one-thousandth of a second after he had left, a dazzling red light swept past which almost tore apart the sky!
Such a powerful attack! If Mu Linbai had been just a bit slower, he would have met a gruesome fate!
A smiling figure appeared next to Xia Fei, glancing up at the sky.
“What a pity. I still let him get away,” Yu Hua breezily said.
Xia Fei gave Yu Hua a strange look. That red light, which had torn across the sky moments ago, was clearly some sort of spatial fissure technique, and it had been unleashed by Yu Hua!
“You’re this powerful!” Xia Fei remarked.
Yu Hua nonchalantly looked below. Dark Ghost’s men were rapidly retreating, and the battle was over.
“Though I’m a merchant, that doesn’t mean a merchant can’t know Laws,” Yu Hua said with a smile.
Xia Fei shook his head. “You’re a very formidable merchant. I’ve seen Chief Instructor Yu Luxuan’s attack, and yours was much stronger than his. If my guess is right, you should be a Law Emperor.”
Yu Hua nodded. “Your guess is right, but is there any rule that says a Law Emperor can’t do business?”
Xia Fei did not keep questioning him. Yu Hua was clearly not as harmless as he put on, and he had secrets of his own. For a powerful warrior with Law Emperor cultivation to become an unscrupulous businessman was something that anyone would find strange. That attack he had unleashed earlier was enough to make gods and ghosts weep! It was powerful to an absurd level.
“Who were those people? Why did they want to kill you?” Yu Hua asked.
Xia Fei had not even been in the Law Realm for a month, yet he was being pursued by so many experts. Yu Hua did not know whether to laugh or cry. Was Xia Fei really as the tales from the Alliance made him out to be—someone whom trouble sought even if he did absolutely nothing?
“They didn’t come to kill me but to capture me.”
“Capture you? Who would want to capture you?”
“Some fellow they call Master Ghost.”
“Master Ghost?” Yu Hua smiled. “In this day and age, even cats and dogs like to call themselves ghosts or gods. You can catch someone on the street and find that they call themselves Ghost-something. This name alone won’t be enough to find anything.”
After some thought, Xia Fei added, “Two of his subordinates have the names of Yuan Dian and Mu Linbai.”
Yu Hua nodded, softly saying, “Oh, so they’re Dark Ghost’s men. It seems like someone in the family is working with Dark Ghost. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have gotten in so easily. This drugseller is getting a little too bold.”
Xia Fei suddenly seemed to have a concern and sternly said, “If there’s nothing else, I’ll go first.”
Yu Hua found this rather funny. “Go where? Someone wants to kill you, but you don’t want to know who they are.”
Xia Fei did not turn his head. “I’ll go and find you tomorrow, but I have something urgent to attend to right now.”
Yu Hua did not know why Xia Fei was in such a hurry that he even did not wait to find out who his enemy was.
Phantom curiously asked, “What are you doing? It would be fine to hear him talk about that Ghost fellow.”
Xia Fei whispered, “When I used the Law of Primal Chaos to reverse Yuan Dian’s attack, it seemed to have set off a chain reaction. I’m about to break into the second level of the Law of Primal Chaos.”
“Level 2 of the Law of Primal Chaos!” Phantom exclaimed in shock. “You’ll be making a breakthrough tonight?”
“Tonight!” replied Xia Fei with a firm nod.



Chapter-533--Level-2-of-the-Law-of-Primal-Chaos
Chapter 533: Level 2 of the Law of Primal Chaos 
As the saying went, success came serendipitously, not through plans or schemes. Xia Fei had been trying all he could to comprehend the Law of Energy Purification; alas, he was unable to comprehend it, and his progress had been slow.
However, after a battle, he was on the brink of advancing in the Law of Primal Chaos. Before, Xia Fei would always pour all this disruptive force into all his fighting techniques, but this time, he had used his body as the medium to circulate his power. This had resulted in his comprehension of the Law of Primal Chaos massively increasing, allowing him to achieve level 2 successfully!
Once more examining his seventh brain region, where two mysterious patterns were aligned next to each other, Xia Fei let out a long sigh. He exited his cultivation state and walked out of his room into the yard.
It was already bright, the artificial sun hanging high in the sky.
The Yu family was still, seemingly unaffected by the battle from last night.
“Congratulations. You’ve successfully grasped the second level of the Law of Primal Chaos,” Phantom said with a smile. “Your attack power should have at least doubled, should it not?”
Xia Fei lit a cigarette. “Perhaps. In truth, the greatest boost I’ve received from getting to level 2 is in its control. Look.”
Xia Fei reached out with his right hand as Phantom watched.
“There’s some mysterious power circulating through your palm. Is it the Law of Primal Chaos?”
Xia Fei firmly nodded. “I find it much easier to control the Law of Primal Chaos now. Without using much effort, I can pour this disruptive force into wherever I please. I don’t know how much my fighting power has increased, but this sort of unrestrained control is far more exciting.”
Phantom heartily laughed. “Everyone else thinks that your fighting power originates from your unique understanding of the Law of Space. They have no idea that your true trump card is the Law of Primal Chaos!
“This subversive and disruptive force you have is truly too heaven-defying. Last night, you made a mess of that fellow Yuan Dian. Backlash from an ability? He’s probably going to his grave confused.”
Xia Fei replied, “The Law of Primal Chaos truly does take people by surprise. Over the month or so I’ve been here, I’ve never heard of anyone else cultivating the Law of Primal Chaos. Is such a powerful law not known even in the Law Realm?”
The Law of Primal Chaos was truly very heaven-defying. Otherwise, the Gods of Black and White would not have been hunted down for researching it, but Xia Fei did not know of such a thing, nor did he know that only three people in the universe could use the Law of Primal Chaos. Besides the Gods of Black and White, there was just Xia Fei.
The Gods of Black and White had been forced to flee far away from their home. Xia Fei alone walked the path of primal chaos and reversal. Was it a blessing or a curse? Xia Fei did not know yet.
“The Gods of Black and White were the ones who gave you the Law of Primal Chaos, and they’re members of the God Race, which is one of the two supreme races in the Law Realm. You’re still very far away from their level. The same is true for the people of the Yu family. It’s very normal for them not to know of the Law of Primal Chaos,” Phantom said.
After eating breakfast, Xia Fei took Furball to see Yu Hua so as to learn who this Dark Ghost person was.
Last night, he had been in such a rush to leave because he sensed that his Law of Primal Chaos was on the verge of reaching level 2. That desire to break through had been so intense that Xia Fei could not even stay for fifteen minutes.
The Yu family’s main city.
Yu Hua’s home was an ordinary twelve-story building in the suburbs. He lived alone on the top floor.
Xia Fei knocked on the door and was welcomed with the sight of Yu Hua’s bloodshot eyes.
“Come inside and sit.” Yu Hua let Xia Fei into his home.
As an unscrupulous and rather big-time businessman, Yu Hua did not have a single servant, and his home was almost absurdly simple and clean. This left Xia Fei rather surprised.
It was utterly spotless—a sign that Yu Hua was a very meticulous person.
“After an entire night of work, I managed to find out what Dark Ghost’s men were after,” Yu Hua said as he threw Xia Fei a bottle of mineral water.
Xia Fei was taken aback. “What does that guy want? I don’t remember ever provoking him.”
Yu Hua replied, “Dark Ghost is an Apothecary. In his early days, he was called Bai Yingxia, and he was actually rather famous in the circle, but because he began to research forbidden hormones, he was banished.
“Since then, he changed his name to Dark Ghost and has amassed quite a number of excellent people under him. He focuses specifically on producing psychedelics and hormones.”
Xia Fei was confused. “Let him manufacture his hormones. What does that have to do with me?”
Yu Hua smiled and turned on his terminal so that he could show Xia Fei a video. The video depicted the scene of Yu Guhe stealing his brain-healing medicine from Plentiful Peace Hall.
“This man is a drug seller in the clan, who has a small connection with Dark Ghost. He stole the brain-healing liquid you concocted and probably took it to Dark Ghost for him to research. Dark Ghost must’ve discovered that your medicine is pretty good, so he sent his men to grab you so that he could question you on the recipe.”
Xia Fei replied, “It’s a tenable hypothesis, but it’s just some brain-healing medicine. Is it really worth a bunch of drug sellers sending such a large force into the Yu family to capture me?”
Yu Hua rolled his eyes at Xia Fei. In the past, Xia Fei’s brain region had been severely damaged, and he and Phantom had researched many recipes which had failed to heal it. Thus, the two of them had not regarded these medicines as being anything much, but in the Law Realm, any medicine that could heal the seventh brain region was extremely valuable!
“So you’re saying that the medicine works?” Yu Hua asked.
“It works, but the effects are very poor. It can only repair a little bit, and if it encounters any severe damage, it will immediately lose effect,” Xia Fei nonchalantly said.
“A bit?” Yu Hua laughed. “This is the Law Realm. Even healing a bit is already incredible. The circle has so many Law Adepts, and not everyone has the ability to buy high-level medicines. Plus, because of cultivation, most Law Adepts have brain region damage to some level. Even if it’s not that useful, there’s still a market for it.
“Dark Ghost is a master of pharmacology. He wouldn’t try to capture you if he didn’t think that there’s any value in it.”
Xia Fei felt that Yu Hua’s words made sense. The thought that the medicine he looked down on would be so valuable left him feeling rather surprised.
Suddenly, Yu Hua thought of something and stretched out a hand as he beamed at Xia Fei. “I heard that your financial situation is pretty good as of late. Isn’t it time you return the money I loaned you?”
“What money?”
“Remember? When you first got here, I gave you ten grade 2 Origin Crystals, and I even brought you through the Spatial Gate. That costs money! Are you not going to recognize your debt?”
Xia Fei pursed his lips. Yu Hua truly was an unscrupulous businessman. He was even after a little money like this! So stingy!
“How much?”
“Adding on the interest, I’ll take two grade 3 crystals from you.”
“There’s interest too?!”
“Why not? It’s only natural for loaned money to have interest.”
Xia Fei was speechless. He took out two grade 3 crystals and handed them over.
After carefully putting them away in his ring, Yu Hua said, “Not bad, not bad. Making a little money in the morning means that the rest of the day will go splendidly.
“In short, the cause of all this is your brain-healing medicine, but there’s one thing I don’t get. Since you know pharmacology, how could you not put a blocker in your concoction, and since you didn’t add a blocker, why does Dark Ghost still want to catch you?”
Xia Fei smiled. “I did add a blocker.”
“Impossible. I watched the video from start to finish, but I didn’t see you adding in any substance of the sort.”
Xia Fei replied, “My blocker doesn’t require adding a neutralizer. It comes from another method.”
“What method?” Yu Hua curiously asked.
Of course, Xia Fei would not tell Yu Hua this secret. In truth, even if he wanted to, he would find it very hard to describe. When it came to purification, Xia Fei’s medicine had no secret about it. The key was in how it was mixed.
What to put in first, what to put in last, what time to put it in, stirring clockwise or anticlockwise, the temperature of the liquid, the speed at which the liquid was poured… All of which was carefully selected, joining together into a complicated pharmacological process. It stood apart from what was commonly understood as pharmacology and formed its own school.
It was for this reason that Dark Ghost had suffered such a great loss. He had no understanding of its secrets.
Yu Hua saw that Xia Fei was unwilling to talk, so he changed the subject.
“Since you have the recipe, we can produce it on a large scale and sell it. The most valuable thing in the Law Realm is money. Only with money can you have everything.”
Xia Fei smiled but did not answer. He opened a bottle of mineral water and took a sip.
“I have the capital. If you’re willing to provide the recipe, we can split the money evenly. When the time comes, you won’t have to worry about lacking crystals for cultivation.”
Yu Hua’s proposal was truly tempting. Alas, even if Xia Fei wanted to agree, he could not.
Phantom’s methods were all about using everything to their maximum, and it was unimaginably demanding when it came to the mixing process. Only someone who had gone through a long period of training could properly mix the medicine.
This sort of rigorous mixing method was unsuitable for mass production, and not even machines could do it. It was a unique existence.
“I said before, that medicine is basically ineffective and is hardly worth anything. Even if we mass-produce it, we won’t be able to make much money, so just forget about it.” Xia Fei refused.
Yu Hua sighed. Seeing that Xia Fei was not going to agree, he gave up.
“Dark Ghost’s drug sellers and our Yu family have always minded each other’s business. Now that they’ve crossed the line, we must counterattack, or else everyone in the circle will take us as a bunch of softies.”
Xia Fei frowned. “So you’re going to strike back?”
“Not strike back, but wipe them out.”
“When are we making our move?”
“What? You’re interested?” Yu Hua asked with a smile.
Xia Fei firmly nodded. “One has to watch their enemy die with their eyes in order to rest easy.”
Yu Hua’s eyes flashed, seemingly moved by Xia Fei’s words. It appeared that a ruthless decisiveness permeated every cell of Xia Fei’s body.
“Very well. Tomorrow at the same time, I’ll wait for you at the Spatial Gate. Going out to experience a little is good for you. It’s best for Law Adepts to travel around and experience different laws. Only then can their martial techniques swiftly progress.”
“It’s settled then!” Xia Fei sternly said.
…
Cultivation was a very mystical thing. At times, one could put in all of one’s efforts and come out with nothing, and at other times, one might come upon an unexpected harvest.
Though Xia Fei still made no progress in the Law of Energy Purification, his Laws of Space and Primal Chaos made large strides.
The thought of taking revenge on Dark Ghost left Xia Fei feeling excited!
After a night of diligent cultivation, he had gotten even closer to level 5 of the Law of Space.
This rate of progress could be called divine!
Peerlessly divine speed!
“A pity! I’m just a little bit away,” Xia Fei muttered. “If I were given three more days, I could reach level 5.”
The time for departure was here. Xia Fei packed his things, placed Furball on his shoulder, Pod in his spatial ring, and went out.
From a distance, he could already see Yu Hua waiting for him at the Spatial Gate.
“Why is it just you?” Xia Fei asked in confusion. “Didn’t you say that we were going to kill Dark Ghost?”
Yu Hua replied, “We are.”
“Just you and me?” Xia Fei asked in disbelief.
Dark Ghost had many subordinates. On that night alone, one hundred people had appeared.
One unscrupulous businessman and one newly promoted Law Warrior were going to wipe out a powerful drug seller? What in the world?
“I was originally going to go alone. You’re the one who wanted to come.” Yu Hua smiled. “Are you chickening out?”
Xia Fei was speechless. All he could do was harden his head and pass through the Spatial Gate.
Before going, Yu Hua glanced into the distance. In that direction was the pier where Patriarch Yu Jiang spent every day fishing. Yu Hua muttered, “Old rascal, fishing again.”



Chapter-534-Casa
Chapter 534: Casa 
Xia Fei knew that Yu Hua was much stronger than anyone could imagine. Even without Xia Fei coming along, Yu Hua really might be able to deal with Dark Ghost’s group by himself.
However, he suddenly realized a problem. This group consisting of him and Yu Hua was very weird.
Xia Fei was a newly promoted Law Warrior, and just like back in the Alliance, he did not rely on the instructors for guidance, exploring, cultivating, and studying on his own. Though he resided in the Yu family, he wandered around beyond its walls.
Yu Hua, while a member of the Yu family, was not that close with the rest of his clan. The Yu family also did not give Yu Hua any sort of position, and he was purely an independent merchant.
They were both people who disliked depending on others and liked doing things on their own.
They passed through the Spatial Gate into a giant city, chaotic and bustling. One sun had yet to set in the west, while another sun was rising in the east. This city and this planet both seemed very strange.
“This is Casa, one of the most prosperous commercial planets in the circle. As it has three suns orbiting in a cycle, there is no night here. Sunlight bathes this place throughout the day, so it is also called the Nightless Market.” Yu Hua walked up to Xia Fei’s side and spoke.
Xia Fei frowned. “Weren’t we going to Dark Ghost’s base? What are we doing at a market?”
Yu Hua smiled. “Dark Ghost is very cunning. No one knows where his base is, but after my investigation, I learned that the brothers Yu Guhe and Yu Qinghe, as well as those assassins who tried capturing you, all used this place as their first stop.”
“Whether it is through the Spatial Compass or the Spatial Gate, they can be tracked by the Enforcement Board. Presumably, there’s a transfer station at Casa Market which they use to get to Dark Ghost’s base. Our first step is to investigate this place and find Dark Ghost’s underlings in the market.”
The market extended all the way to the horizon, and the crowds were ceaseless. In Spatial Gates alone, there were several in the area, and every few minutes, someone would arrive or leave. Trying to track down Dark Ghost would not be an easy task.
“Chaotic and bustling markets are the perfect places for doing a little dirty business. Casa is also an infamous black market in the circle. This is a great time for you to experience a bit and understand the dark side of the Law Realm,” Yu Hua lightly added.
Xia Fei had no objection. He was a very curious person, and while black markets symbolized filth, they also represented opportunity. Many excellent items, which could not see the light of day, were available for trade here. As long as one had good enough eyes, they might be able to exchange for one or two useful items.
Yu Hua and Xia Fei left the platform that the Spatial Gate was located on and joined the throngs of people. This place was as chaotic as a food market. There were hawkers, brawlers, drinkers, socialites, warriors with profound gazes, and petty peddlers. All sorts of people were squeezed together into a strange group.
“Let’s first find an inn to stay at, and then we can take our time with the search.” Yu Hua suggested.
After passing through several bustling small alleys, they arrived at an unremarkable hotel. At the entrance, two drunkards were supporting each other as they vomited. Xia Fei could not help but pinch his nose. This environment was truly rather awful.
They opened the door and entered the gloomy hotel. There was a plump woman behind the small counter, wearing a short blouse which exposed her legs covered in black hair. Her body was greasy all over, and she was gnawing on some sort black substance.
Seeing Yu Hua and Xia Fei walk in, the fat woman wiped her mouth with her hand and then reached into a drawer for a key that she placed on the counter.
Yu Hua nodded at her, grabbed the oily key, and went up the stairs with Xia Fei.
“The best thing about places like this is that no one cares what you do. If you go to the higher-class hotels, you’ll inevitably end up drawing someone’s attention,” Yu Hua explained to Xia Fei.
The room at the end of the second floor corridor was opened, and the pungent scent of mold assailed them. In truth, this room was already the best the hotel had. As it was at the end of the corridor, the three windows opened in three different directions, offering a wide field of view.
Alas, the sounds coming from outside were all vulgar, and the stenches from the street would waft inside. It was better to just close the windows.
The room was both simple and messy. Two beds, two chairs, two wardrobes—one of them missing one of its doors—and the bedding was sporting so many colors that it seemed like a flag of all nations.
Yu Hua took out two bottles of mineral water from his spatial ring and a delicate white porcelain bottle. From this bottle, he took out two crimson pills.
“This is ‘Nothim’. Once you eat it, you can change your appearance. The medicinal effect will persist for a week. Dark Ghost’s men might recognize either you or me, so it’d be best if we change our appearances,” Yu Hua said.
As Xia Fei took the pill and examined it; Yu Hua placed the pill on his tongue and swallowed it down with some water.
Several minutes later, Yu Hua’s very white and clean face became dark and tanned; a thick beard sprouted beneath his chin, and his facial features shifted around. He appeared almost like the legendary Zhang Fei.
Looking at himself in a mirror, Yu Hua seemed very satisfied. “Not bad. The medicine is working perfectly.”
Phantom carefully examined the pill and concluded. “There’s nothing wrong with this medicine, but it contains too much Craneflame Grass. If you eat it, you’ll end up looking older.”
Xia Fei nodded. As long as it was not poisonous, he did not care who he became. After all, it was changing his face. The worse his looks, the better.
A few moments later, Xia Fei became a savage middle-aged man, a frightening scar across the right side of his face. With this fiendish face, if he tried to kidnap someone, he could frighten them half to death without doing a thing.
Phantom hid to the side to have a laugh. Xia Fei had always been a rather relaxed and smiling person, which caused many of his enemies to mistake him for someone who was easy to bully around and make trouble.
Of course, those people who had tried to make trouble for Xia Fei had all died very miserable deaths, for while Xia Fei was relaxed only on the surface, his bones were brimming with violence and a determination to kill.
Now, Xia Fei could not play the role of the smiling man hiding a dagger behind his back. This savage face and the sharp eyes utterly exposed him, wickedness written all over his face.
Xia Fei frowned, very dissatisfied with this appearance. It made people far too wary, and he had no means of catching someone by surprise and stabbing them in the back.
“Mm, not bad. Even a close friend of yours probably won’t recognize you,” Yu Hua nodded and said.
“I need to go and see someone, so I’ll be back late. You can stay in the hotel or go out to find your own amusement. If you encounter any problems, use this to notify me.”
Saying this, Yu Hua threw a miniature terminal at Xia Fei. “This is an encrypted model, so you don’t have to worry about anyone listening in.”
Xia Fei nodded; after which, Yu Hua turned and left.
This room was truly too unbearable. Furball, who would usually throw itself on a bed as soon as it saw one, decided to stay on Xia Fei’s shoulder. It could not help but sigh, for it seemed like it would even have to put off its afternoon nap today.
Xia Fei took Pod out from his spatial ring, and the diligent little robot immediately began cleaning the room without the slightest complaint.
Fortunately, the bathroom had an automatic washing unit. Pod quickly cleaned the bedding so it seemed brand new; after which, he began working on wiping the windows and the ceiling.
Furball and Xia Fei took a bed. Furball began snoring away, while Xia Fei threw himself into cultivating the Law of Space.
Level 5 was on the precipice of completion, and some additional strength would be more protection. Xia Fei suppressed his desire to go to the market and patiently began exploring the Law of Space.
A grade 3 Origin Crystal was completely consumed, so Xia Fei took out a second. As his rank increased, the rate at which he consumed energy would accelerate. Each day, he required a large amount of energy to sustain his cultivation progress. Originally, Xia Fei needed over ten grade 2 Origin Crystals every day; nowadays, he needed three hundred! The energy consumption rate had increased by twenty times!
“I’m getting closer and closer. The Law of Space totem is at 90% completion,” Xia Fei said, stopping his cultivation.
Phantom sternly nodded. “Excessive cultivation is not desirable. Rest a little and then you can break through with one last push!”
The room had already been cleaned up. Pod had done a lot in this time, while Furball had done nothing but sleep.
Xia Fei put away Pod, grabbed Furball, and left the hotel.
As this was his first time in Casa, Xia Fei did not understand where the interesting places were, so he just randomly wandered around.
He got strange looks from all sides, but very few people dared to look at him directly. This was because his appearance was far too savage. His face was that of a killing god!
Xia Fei did not care about the looks of others and paid them no mind.
After strolling on several streets, Xia Fei arrived at a somewhat wider avenue.
The stores on both sides sold weapons, and Xia Fei avidly looked through them.
There were ordinary weapons here which were infused with Law energy. The prices varied, but all weapons infused with Law energy commanded high prices which would leave one speechless.
“This is a wristguard which has a built-in spatial barrier. It possesses the defensive power of a Law Sovereign. If you’re attacked, the barrier will automatically activate, becoming a steel wall that protects you from harm!”
In a rather large store, a salesman pointed at a silver wristguard at the center of the lobby. It was covered with fancy patterns and gleamed.
“A Law Sovereign defense?” Xia Fei muttered. “How much does this thing go for?”
“Not expensive at all. A thousand grade 3 Origin Crystals! If you want it, I can even give you a ten percent discount,” the short-bearded salesman replied.
Xia Fei shook his head. There was no way he could shoulder this price. While a defense tool was good, alas, his money was finite. At most, he had seven hundred grade 3 Origin Crystals. These Law weapons, which could easily go for tens of thousands of grade 3 Origin Crystals, were beyond his means.
Walking out of the store, Xia Fei looked up and saw two suns overhead. Casa was a planet of eternal day, and the temperature was very high. Yu Hua had been gone for ten-some hours, but there was still no news from him. Xia Fei could not help but start getting worried.
Suddenly, a black dot flying out of the sky drew Xia Fei’s attention. It seemed like something was falling out of space.
The sunlight was so bright that Xia Fei could hardly make it out.
*Snap!*
The long-range vision system his armor was equipped with activated, and Xia Fei squinted and focused.
“It’s a meteor!” Xia Fei sternly said as he more clearly made out the flying object.
Numerous uncontrolled meteors flew through the universe, blindly hurtling through the river of stars. Be they spaceships or planets, they were all frequently assailed by meteors.
It was moving incredibly fast!
The meteor penetrated through Casa’s atmosphere and ignited into flames!
*Whoosh~*
It flew over the market and landed in the distance.
The billboards on both sides of the street instantly stopped working, and all electronic equipment fell silent as if they had all broken at the same time!
“It’s an ultra-electromagnetic wave! This meteor was carrying darkness metal!” Xia Fei furrowed his brows and sternly said.



Chapter-535-Darkness-Metal
Chapter 535: Darkness Metal 
The meteor streaked across the sky at maximum speed, leaving a long trail behind it.
All electronic equipment immediately stopped working!
*Bang!*
Things were not over once the meteor disappeared at the end of the horizon. A massive shockwave swept out like a storm!
This was an electromagnetic storm, a superstorm created by darkness metal!
*Rumble!*
There was chaos in the streets!
The pedestrians out were blown to the ground by the shockwave, and some of the older buildings even collapsed from the shockwave!
Xia Fei crossed his arms in front of his chest and rooted his feet against the ground.
*Tsst!*
The communications terminal on his wrist that Yu Hua had left for him became scalding hot and began to spark!
Xia Fei hastily threw the terminal to the ground. An electromagnetic storm would instantly destroy all chips, and this machine was clearly already broken.
Any electronic device would have some shielding. Electromagnetic waves were ever present in the interstellar era and needed to be guarded against.
Alas, the electromagnetic waves brought by this meteor were simply too powerful. Even the shielding had been rendered ineffective.
“Pod!”
Xia Fei paled. Pod was a robot, and his body was packed with chips. Would he be affected by all this electromagnetic disturbance? He would be in trouble if something happened to Pod!
He hurriedly released Pod from the spatial ring. The little robot appeared very uneasy, but he did not seem to be affected by the electromagnetic disturbance.
“Master, this is scary! There’s electromagnetic disturbance everywhere, and it’s the ultra-electromagnetic waves brought by Darkness Metal,” Pod fearfully said as he looked around.
Xia Fei softly asked, “Are you okay?”
“I was in the spatial ring just now, so I’m fine. Moreover, my body was modified by the Sentinel Goddess and is extremely resistant to electromagnetic disturbances.
After confirming that Pod was fine, Xia Fei sighed in relief and put him back into the spatial ring to prevent him from being caught in any after-pulse.
The street was in disarray. Injured civilians were moaning in pain, while merchants grumbled about how their computers broke, all of their sales data destroyed.
“It really is Darkness Metal!” Xia Fei said to himself.
“What is Darkness Metal?” Phantom curiously asked.
“It’s a very precious high-level alloy. It naturally forms in the universe and is impossible to replicate. It is extraordinarily valuable. I came to know a bit about it when studying the technology of the ancient civilization.
“Even a tiny bit of Darkness Metal is incredibly valuable. It’s one of the best materials for making weapons. That ultra-electromagnetic explosion earlier was because the Darkness Metal contained in the meteor reacted when it was passing through the atmosphere!”
Gritting his teeth, Xia Fei stared at the distant impact zone.
Casa had many experts, and presumably many of them knew the value of Darkness Metal. At this moment, the battle for Darkness Metal had probably already begun!
The communications terminal was broken, so Xia Fei could not get in touch with Yu Hua or find out where he was.
“Come on; let’s go and look at the impact zone,” Xia Fei sternly said.
*Whoosh~*
Xia Fei jumped onto a roof and swiftly moved into the distance.
“Even the Spatial Gates are broken!” Phantom gasped. “This electromagnetic storm is truly something else!”
Several dozen Spatial Gates had been set up around Casa to make it easier for businessmen to move around.
At this moment, all of these gates had stopped working! This also meant that all routes leading outside of Casa had been sealed! The city had been locked down!
Even leaving via warship was impossible. This was because warships needed electronic systems to function, and all electronic systems on this planet had been damaged!
Xia Fei saw quite a few Adepts making their way toward the meteor’s impact site. They could be curious, or they could also be after Darkness Metal. They had differing goals, but there was one thing for certain. The more people there were, the worse the situation was for Xia Fei!
Darkness Metal’s value was inestimable. After all, it was the finest material for crafting weapons and armor, and it had many other uses in advanced technologies. A piece of Darkness Metal dropping from the heavens was enough to make one go insane!
In the distance, a tower of smoke rose into the sky.
The surrounding trees had pushed outward, making the impact zone look somewhat like a crop circle.
A massive crater had been smashed out of the ground, the earth as hot as a volcano!
“Kill him!”
Before Xia Fei could get close to the meteor, he was surrounded and attacked!
Several Law Adepts, who had arrived before Xia Fei, had decided to kill anyone who got close; swift-footed Xia Fei became their next target!
‘I can’t force my way through!’ Xia Fei mentally remarked.
‘Crafty Approach!’
Launching himself forward, Xia Fei accelerated past these Adepts in an effort to approach the meteor from the side. However, after running one thousand meters, he discovered that there was fighting on this side, too!
An iron tower of a Law Adept was fighting against a short and thin fellow.
There was fighting everywhere!
There was blood everywhere!
Xia Fei avoided direct confrontation, relying on Crafty Approach and his speed ability to get closer to the crater.
A pitch-black meteor lay at the bottom of the crater. It was not that large, only about one meter in diameter.
The friction from moving through the atmosphere had left the meteor with an extremely high surface temperature. Smoking was seething off of it, scorching the surrounding soil.
Three people stood in a triangle around it, their eyes focused on the meteor while Law Adepts battled around them.
“Yu Hua!”
Xia Fei immediately recognized one of the three people at the center to be Yu Hua. The others were a red-haired elder and a thin, weak-looking middle-aged man with a fair face.
He had already arrived, but it appeared that he was just standing around here with the other two, all three greedily eyeing the meteor.
Perhaps because his appearance was too savage, Xia Fei was immediately encircled and attacked.
By using ‘Nothim’, Xia Fei had changed his appearance and rendered himself unrecognizable. This should have been a good thing; alas, his fiendish face stood out too much. No matter where Xia Fei went, he would become the first target of attack.
“Die!”
A Law Adept suddenly emerged from the ground. The powers of the Law of Matter allowed him to become one with the soil and take enemies by surprise easily.
The earth turned into a dagger in his hand which he stabbed at Xia Fei’s chest!
“Crafty Approach!”
Stomping his foot against the ground, Xia Fei made a semicircle and appeared behind the adept!
A punch infused with the Law of Primal Chaos struck out!
*Bang!*
Blood rained down, the Law of Matter adept was instantly blown into chunks by Xia Fei’s punch!
“So powerful! Level 2 of the Law of Primal Chaos isn’t one to mess around!” Phantom said in shock.
Xia Fei was also astonished. This was his first time in combat since reaching level 2 of the Law of Primal Chaos. He had not expected it to multiply his fighting power by so much!
His confidence swelled!
The sensation of power left Xia Fei extremely satisfied!
Yu Hua’s eyes narrowed into thin slits. Xia Fei’s performance had left him very surprised.
He still did not move. Yu Hua and the other two were like old monks in meditation, just standing there. What exactly were they trying to do?
At this moment, a scream came from the meteor in the center. A Law Adept had tried to ambush Yu Hua and the other two adepts; alas, he had barely gotten close when he suddenly bounced away, a powerful energy penetrating through his body.
*Thump!*
The man landed on the ground, vomited blood, and died.
“So Yu Hua and those other two are engaging in some unseen battle. The Law energy each of them is releasing is in equilibrium. Anyone who tries to get between them will suffer an energy backlash. Anyone else who tries to get close will suffer the same result!” Phantom sternly said.
Xia Fei carefully looked. Sure enough, the air around them was solidified. The dust drifting through the air would drift away when it got close to them, stopped by some invisible wall.
This had to be the power of the Law of Space!
What sort of foe could fight evenly with Yu Hua? These two were probably also Law Emperors!
Three Law Emperors were in one place and fighting with one another. This was a rare sight, and the reason was the precious Darkness Metal!
Xia Fei slowly walked up behind Yu Hua, wondering how he could get between these three Law Emperors and steal the meteor. Alas, the possible outcomes were all poor. He had seen Yu Hua attack before, and one attack could shake the heavens! Xia Fei did not have the strength to contend against a Law Emperor.
The other two people gradually gathered their own men. They had clearly come with their own subordinates.
Yu Hua smiled. “This is no way of doing things. Let’s lock this place down first. If some other experts come in, we’ll probably all die very gruesomely.”
The other two grimaced. None of the three Law Emperors was backing down, their Law energy wrangling against one another such that none could break away. If a fourth Law Emperor, all three of them could be killed very easily.
The red-haired elder nodded at his subordinate. This subordinate took out a pyramidal object from his spatial ring and placed it near the center of the meteor.
“This is the Golden Bell Curtain! A large-scale spatial protection weapon! So this red-haired elder is part of the Sunglory Jin Clan!”
The others present were amazed. This Sunglory Jin Clan was apparently a very formidable family in the Law Realm.
The strange pyramidal device activated, red beams of light shot in the air and then descended like a sun umbrella, concealing the crater and everyone inside it. It was impossible for outsiders to make out what was going on inside, but those inside could see what was going on outside.
The red-haired elder coldly laughed. “Jin Gu, clean up these extras!”
As he spoke, an Adept of the Jin Clan suddenly struck. Led by a young man of twenty-some years, all those who were not followers of one of the three Law Emperors were slain!
Xia Fei frowned. He was standing behind Yu Hua and was considered to be one of Yu Hua’s men. Although Jin Gu did not attack him, he shot him a hostile and murderous glance.
In his bosom, Furball became restless. He instinctively sensed danger and began radiating fighting intent.
Through their mental connection, Xia Fei instructed him to restrain himself. In this stalemate of three Law Emperors, the Sunglory Jin Clan had the most men, with over ten warriors, all of rather high rank. The white-faced middle-aged man had seven, and then the weakest was Yu Hua, who had just Xia Fei on his side.
Furball was Xia Fei’s trump card, and he would not show off Furball’s power until the last moment. All warriors had to leave themselves a back-up plan!
The crater became much emptier, with only the three parties left. Everyone else had been killed.
The red-haired elder proposed, “Since we’re all at about the same level of strength, why don’t we split this Darkness Metal evenly to avoid damaging a good relationship?”
The middle-aged man hesitated, but Yu Hua snorted.
“An even split? This Darkness Metal is mine! The rest of you will get squat!” His eyes erupted with killing intent!
Xia Fei was flabbergasted. He had never realized that this unscrupulous businessman would have such a vicious side to him!



Chapter-536-Yu-Huas-Scheme
Chapter 536: Yu Hua’s Scheme 
“An even split? This Darkness Metal is mine! The rest of you will get squat!”
Yu Hua’s words left everyone stunned!
Unmasked arrogance and killing intent, completely different from the haggling merchant of the past. It was as if Yu Hua had become a completely different person.
The red-haired elder sighed. “You can eat whatever you want, but you can’t say whatever you want without consequences.
“We of the Sunglory Jin Clan are able to stand tall in the Law Realm for so long purely because we scared everyone off. If my guess is right, the one on my left should be someone from the Coldvalley Liu Clan, yes?”
The frail middle-aged man nodded. “Yes. This one is proud to call myself Liu Hanzong, deacon of the Coldvalley Liu Clan.”
A deacon was the equivalent of a Yu Clan elder, one of the top individuals of the family. This middle-aged man seemed to have a rather high status. Though he appeared weak, he spoke with great force and vigor.
The red-haired elder chuckled. “Nice to meet you. I am the steward of the Sunglory Jin Clan, Jin Shuimin.”
Liu Hanzong gave a slight nod, thus completing the exchange of courtesies. They were both members of respected families in the Law Realm. Though they were fighting against each other, they at least needed to keep up with their appearances.
Jin Shuimin turned to Yu Hua and asked, “And which clan is this Law Emperor from? Let me and Brother Liu understand who we are dealing with.”
There were only so many people with Law Emperor cultivation in the circle. While they might not have met before, he should have at least heard the name. Jin Shuimin both wanted to find out who Yu Hua was and to also draw closer to Liu Hanzong.
When three parties were fighting, joining hands with one party to beat down the other was the best solution.
Yu Hua heartily laughed. “The Sunglor Jins and the Coldvalley Lius! Such mighty families! I am just a nobody, so there’s no need for you two to worry about me.”
Jin Shuimin and Liu Hanzong were startled. If Yu Hua was unwilling to reveal his true name, he clearly had other plans. They exchanged glances, the two ready to work together.
Yu Hua’s ‘Nothim’ pill had to be blamed for this. Both Xia Fei and Yu Hua originally had harmless faces which were difficult to remember and hard to dislike.
However, after taking the pill, Yu Hua had become like Zhang Fei, a thick beard covering half of his vicious face.
Xia Fei had become like a butcher selling meat in the middle of the street, his fiendish face even sporting a scar!
They simply did not seem like good persons, more like marauders who specialized in burglary as they exuded the aura of bandits.
First impressions were very important. Among the twenty or so people present, Yu Hua and Xia Fei’s side was the weakest, and they also had savage and fiendish appearances. Was this not seeking bad luck? It was easy to earn the hostility of others.
Xia Fei quietly stroked Furball. The situation was obvious. Yu Hua had suddenly become domineering, placing himself in a bad position. The Sunglory Jins and Coldvalley Lius had already decided to work together to deal with Xia Fei and Yu Hua.
It was too late to complain. Yu Hua had already made his bold declaration and offended everyone present. All Xia Fei had time for was to simulate the situation in his mind and find a way out of this mess swiftly.
Jin Shuimin and Liu Hanzong used their eyes to communicate. Their men could smell what was going on and quietly began to surround Xia Fei.
Yu Hua suddenly coldly grunted, his eyes glinting with savagery. “It’s easy to get in, but don’t even think about leaving this place alive!
“Seven Dragons Split the Heavens!”
*Rumble!*
Dazzling spatial fissures erupted from Yu Hua’s arms, seven in all. They rapidly expanded as they rushed at Jin Shuimin and Liu Hanzong!
The Jin and Liu Law Emperors instantly paled!
“Seven dragons! So you already broke through the threshold of level 6! You’re a Great Law Emperor!”
Law Emperor and Great Law Emperor differed by only a word, but this word represented a gap as vast as that between heaven and earth!
In the cultivation of laws, levels 1 and 6 were thresholds. Between levels 5 and 6 was a pit which was difficult to cross, and to move from level 9 Law Adept to level 1 Law Elder was another threshold. Yu Hua had already crossed the level 6 threshold, so he was not just a Law Emperor but rather a level 7 Great Law Emperor!
Xia Fei frowned. He knew that Yu Hua was powerful but not this powerful!
He was an unscrupulous businessman, but he was also a top-class Great Law Emperor!
Originally, Jin Shuimin, Liu Hanzong, and Yu Hua had been in a stalemate, even in both offense and defense, but when Yu Hua revealed his true strength, the balance tipped completely in his favor!
Seven dragons tore through space, increasing the pressure on Jin and Liu as they slowly and steadily moved through the air.
Jin Shuimin and Liu Hanzong paled as they tried with all their might to fight back against Yu Hua. Alas, the gap in strength rendered them helpless. If the three of them had not been engaged in that stalemate, the two might have been able to work together to kill Yu Hua, but now, anyone who pulled out would suffer a backlash.
Beneath the Golden Bell Curtain were three Law Emperors, Xia Fei, and more than twenty Law Adepts. The Jin and Liu subordinates saw that the situation was perilous, but there was nothing they could do except worry. The triangle formed by the three Law Emperors was a danger zone, and those of low cultivation would be penetrated through by Law energy. All they could do was watch as the balance tipped in Yu Hua’s favor.
That young man under Jin Shuimin’s command called Jin Gu turned a frosty gaze on Xia Fei. His steward was no match for Yu Hua, so he shifted his anger onto Xia Fei.
“Crafty Approach!”
Xia Fei had sharp eyes, so rather than waiting for the Jin Clan warriors to attack him first, he went on the offensive!
Winning was one thing, but daring to fight was another!
Even though he was outnumbered and outgunned, these were not good enough reasons to become timid.
Even if this was the day of the universe’s destruction, true warriors would never just sit back and wait for death!
“Furball! Kill!”
Awooo!
Receiving Xia Fei’s order, Furball immediately jumped out. The second offensive form of the Shatterstar Beast activated!
Six halos descended, enclosing Furball.
These halos were energy Furball had accumulated over a long period, and anyone would find it hard to break through them.
In truth, Furball’s second form was primarily defensive, but if it was used properly, defense could also serve as offense!
Floating through the air, Furball became a cannonball!
Xia Fei was right behind him.
Like he was bowling, Furball used the energy halos to protect himself as he hurtled into the warriors, slamming into anything in his path.
The opposing warriors hastily dodged to the side. The power Furball contained was so powerful that any warrior with some sense could tell that this ball-shaped and chubby exotic beast was extremely dangerous.
*Bang!*
Two somewhat weaker Law Adepts were sent flying!
Furball’s halos had obliterated their spatial barriers!
Furball had not eaten those Origin Crystals for nothing. He had stored it all up precisely to use in battles like this!
Xia Fei followed right behind Furball. He had no shield, for Furball was his shield!
In his left hand was the Blood Crystal, and in his right hand was October Flying Snow.
One was a bloodthirsty knife while the other was an ice-sealing dagger. Both were lethal weapons that killed without leaving a trace!
*Whoosh!*
Left and right attacked in unison!
Xia Fei followed right behind Furball, using the path he had created, stabbing anyone that got close!
This was a very sinister tactic. Holy Beast Shatterstar’s defensive power was obscene, and no one dared to take it on directly. They could only dodge to the side, but while this let them avoid Furball’s charge, it did not take them out of Xia Fei’s attack range!
This was a Crafty Thrust infused with the Law of Primal Chaos! Not even a spatial barrier could stop this, for each thrust had disruptive power contained within!
In a flash, three Law Adepts had been blasted away by Furball while four others, who had only been focused on avoiding Furball, were pierced by Xia Fei’s Sly Thrust. In just two charges, half of the twelve Jin Clan subordinates had been slain.
One man and one ball wreaked havoc beneath the Golden Bell Curtain, leaving behind blood and death in their wake!
The Jin Clan members cultivated the Law of Space, and they were experts in the defensive arts. As for the Coldvalley Lius, they specialized in the Law of Matter.
As Xia Fei and Furball charged over, the terrain suddenly changed!
Walls rose from the earth, made from the metal extracted from the soil. This was the defense that Matter Law users excelled in.
However, Furball did not care and charged right at the walls!
*Rumble!*
Like a giant bulldozer, he ran over the wall. No steel wall could stop Furball’s progress. He crushed through three walls in a row, charging into the seven Liu Clan Law Adepts at the center as he howled.
*Crack crack!*
With a nimble flick of his wrists, Xia Fei punched a hole in the throats of two Law Adepts and then continued onward with Furball.
No one had seen such strange tactics before, and for a moment, the remaining adepts were in a panic. Furball and Xia Fei had the upper hand!
“I knew it! That’s the Holy Beast Shatterstar!” a Law Adept yelled.
“What?! Shatterstar?! That monster that’s said to be able to destroy planets?!”
“My god! He has a Shatterstar for a pet! We’re doomed!”
Upon realizing what Furball really was, these Law Adepts became even more frantic. As someone with a holy beast as a pet, Xia Fei suddenly became much more powerful in their eyes, and together with his savage visage, he became an extremely intimidating presence.
On the other end, Yu Hua’s Seven Dragons Split the Heavens technique had already broken the encirclement!
There was no more stopping the twisting and tearing of space. The veins on the foreheads of Jin Shuimin and Liu Hanzong bulged, and they could only watch as the dragon-like tears got closer and closer!
*Rumble!*
The stalemate was finally broken!
The seven tears slashed at the two Law Emperors like seven sharp sabers!
*Bang!*
Space tore apart, and not just space, but the people within that space!
Jin Shuimin was struck by four tears, Liu Hanzong by three!
Their bodies shattered like glass, exploding into pieces!
Xia Fei was alarmed at this sight. So this was the true power of the Law of Space!
Sure enough, the Yu family was a clan that excelled at spatial tears, with Yu Hua fully displaying this power!
With one move, he had torn apart the body of a Law Emperor? This power was unbelievable! A dominance that was difficult to describe!
In truth, there was a reason Yu Hua could do this. The three of them had originally been in a stalemate, their law energy neutralizing each other. Once this balance was broken, none of them would be able to set up spatial barriers. This was like the tide. When the tide receded, one always needed a few minutes to stabilize.
“Could Yu Hua have been scheming against Jin Shuimin and Liu Hanzong from the start? He intentionally lowered his strength so that he could form an equilibrium with the other two, baiting Jin Shuimin into using the Golden Bell Curtain to cover the crater. In this way, no one would be able to find out what happened inside. After that, he broke the equilibrium he created with his hands to kill two Law Emperors with one move, taking the valuable Darkness Metal for himself!”
Superb logical analysis had always been one of Xia Fei’s strong suits, and the conclusion he had reached shook him to the core!
If it were really as Xia Fei speculated, Yu Hua’s shrewdness and decisiveness were terrifying beyond belief! Everything had been within his calculations!
Xia Fei could not help but shiver, for Yu Hua’s calculations had not included Xia Fei as part of the equation!



Chapter-537-Splitting-the-Spoils
Chapter 537: Splitting the Spoils 
Yu Hua revealed an entirely different side of him, leaving Xia Fei doubtful and suspicious. Just when Xia Fei was getting lost in some absurd ideas, a new development took place!
“I’m taking you two down with me!”
Jin Gu saw that his clan’s steward was dead, and in rage, he took out a black metal sphere from his ring.
This sphere looked like a grenade, its black surface gleaming.
“We’ll perish together!” Jin Gu brashly called out as he slammed the sphere on the ground.
Xia Fei instinctively felt danger. He wanted to charge up and stop Jin Gu!
“Hurry up and follow me!” Yu Hua pulled back Xia Fei, his eyes brimming with shock.
“This is a Law bomb! A destructive weapon the Jin Clan excels at making!”
*Bang!*
As he spoke, the bomb exploded.
Space rapidly shattered and collapsed.
A tiny bomb could be this powerful? Shattering the fabric of space? Xia Fei was stupefied!
Yu Hua pulled on Xia Fei with one hand while his other hand sliced through the air.
*Whoosh~*
A spatial door was forcefully opened, and Yu Hua, Xia Fei, Furball, and that meteor containing Darkness Metal vanished without a trace.
*Plush!*
Yu Hua vomited blood.
He had already expended much of his energy in that clash with the other two Law Emperors, and then had to use Law energy to tear through the Golden Bell Curtain, and adding the power of the spatial bomb, it all amounted to a fatal blow!
…
When sunlight reemerged, Xia Fei and Yu Hua were in an unfamiliar valley. Besides Furball and the meteor containing Darkness Metal, there was one of Jin Shuimin’s arms.
Yu Hua leaned against the side of a mountain and panted for breath, occasionally vomiting blood. This battle had clearly done significant damage to him.
He took a pill from his spatial ring and placed it in his mouth, and then he closed his eyes to rest. He said nothing, focusing entirely on healing his injuries.
Xia Fei sat on the side, still feeling some lingering fear from the power of that spatial bomb. If Yu Hua had not used his Law energy to block the shockwave, the consequences would have been unthinkable.
He felt somewhat grateful to Yu Hua, but he also felt somewhat uneasy.
Yu Hua felt unfathomable to Xia Fei. On the surface, he seemed like the usual unscrupulous businessman, even remembering the small sum Xia Fei owed him, but Yu Hua was also a very arrogant Great Law Emperor with a profound cultivation. He had just revealed his wild side, leaving Xia Fei to wonder what had made Yu Hua have such a major split in personality.
Xia Fei did not like people whom he could not see through. It made him feel like he was in danger.
He glanced at the meteor next to him. Darkness Metal was immensely valuable, and it was right in front of him, so he could not help but be tempted. Jin Shuimin’s severed arm was also sporting a flashing spatial ring. As a Law Emperor, he had probably been carrying around a lot of valuable things with him.
Yu Hua’s breathing gradually stabilized, and his complexion began to improve.
Xia Fei suddenly had an idea. If he killed Yu Hua, then both the Darkness Metal and Jin Shuimin’s spatial ring would be his.
Yu Hua was heavily injured. This was a chance for Xia Fei!
His eyes chilled, but he quickly gave up on the idea.
Xia Fei knew very well how powerful Yu Hua was. Alone, Xia Fei did not have the power to fight a Law Emperor. He would be taking on an enormous risk.
Moreover, Xia Fei did not know where he was. Even if he was lucky enough to kill Yu Hua, if he ended up being trapped in here, he would still be in a dire situation.
Seating himself across from Yu Hua, Xia Fei began to meditate. He took out a grade 3 Origin Crystal from his spatial ring and began cultivating the Space law. He was only a bit away from reaching level 5, and Xia Fei would never give up on an opportunity to improve himself.
The Darkness Metal and that tempting spatial ring were right in front of him, but he pretended not to see.
If Xia Fei had a Law Sovereign’s cultivation, he would definitely try to kill Yu Hua and take the treasure for himself, but he did not do it now, for the risk was far too great. In the end, strength reigned supreme. If he had been strong enough, the result would definitely have been different.
Yu Hua saw that Xia Fei was focused on cultivating, and he furtively smiled.
“Quite the smart one.” Yu Hua quietly noted.
…
Xia Fei quickly entered a meditative state, the allure of the Darkness Metal swept away. He had seemingly forgotten his existence as he engrossed himself in cultivating Laws.
The fifth pattern in his brain region was finally completed, and an indescribable joy filled his heart.
Opening his eyes, he saw Yu Hua smiling at him, a look of pleasant surprise in his eyes.
The Darkness Metal and Jin Shuimin’s spatial ring were still in their original positions. It could be seen that Yu Hua had not touched them.
“You advanced again?” Yu Hua asked with a smile.
Xia Fei nodded. “Mm. I just reached level 5. Is your body okay?”
Yu Hua said, “Level 5 after only half a month? You’ve set a new record. I’ve seen people advance quickly, but not this quickly.
“I’ve taken a hard shock from the Space law, but there’s no need to worry. I only need a few days of rest to recover.”
Xia Fei asked, “How exactly was that spatial bomb made? Its power was absurd.”
Yu Hua shook his head. “The Sunglory Jin Clan is an illustrious family in the circle. Besides spatial defense arts, they have a top-class artificer, Jin Yanke. He is the one who made both the Golden Bell Curtain and that incredibly powerful spatial bomb. Casa is probably in a complete mess right now. When a spatial bomb explodes, everything within a hundred kilometers will be flattened, the fabric of space shattered. No one could have survived it.”
Xia Fei firmly nodded. A spatial bomb could tear apart space, so the people within that space would naturally be torn apart as well.
“But this is actually a good thing. No one will know that we killed members of the Jin and Liu families. They’ll think that all the Law Adepts on site died together,” Yu Hua indifferently said.
He had particularly emphasized the word ‘we’, his meaning obvious. He was reminding Xia Fei that, if this matter got out, there was no way he could plead innocence.
“The risk was big, but so was the harvest.” Yu Hua pointed at the Darkness Metal and Jin Shuimin’s spatial ring. “Alas, we left in such a rush that I didn’t get a chance to grab Liu Hanzong’s spatial ring. He was also a Law Emperor, so he probably carried a lot of good things.”
Unmoved, Xia Fei continued to listen to Yu Hua speak.
“Come, let’s split the spoils.” As Yu Hua spoke, he looked at Furball. This fellow was slumbering in Xia Fei’s bosom, completely free of worries.
“How should we split it?” Yu Hua stroked his chin and muttered. “Xia Fei, do you have any good ideas?”
Xia Fei smiled. He knew that Yu Hua was testing him.
“It was all due to your efforts that we could get all this. You have the right to decide how we split it.”
Yu Hua smiled and nodded. “Darkness Metal is very valuable, or else I wouldn’t go through so much effort to get it.
“How about this: I’ll give you two options and you choose one?”
Xia Fei expressed his agreement, and Yu Hua continued. “If you don’t want Darkness Metal, I can give you Jin Shuimin’s spatial ring. He was a Law Emperor, and his clan produces spatial weapons. There are probably many valuable things inside it.
“If you like Darkness Metal, I can give you one-third of it, together with this spatial ring, but everything inside the spatial ring will be mine. From the size of the meteor, we should be able to get fifteen kilograms of Darkness Metal from it.”
Yu Hua’s meaning was obvious. He had pointed out that Jin Shuimin’s clan specialized in the production of spatial weapons to tempt Xia Fei into giving up on the Darkness Metal and choosing the ring and its contents.
Xia Fei hugged Furball and made an exception in feeding him a grade 3 Origin Crystal. Furball was delighted and nuzzled Xia Fei with even greater affection.
“This meteor is very strange, so just give some for me to research,” Xia Fei nonchalantly said.
Frowning, Yu Hua asked, “You want to give up on the contents of the spatial ring and choose the metal?”
Xia Fei smiled. “I’ve been a collector of strange and curious objects since I was a boy. Besides, since the Jin Clan’s Law weapons are produced by Master Jin Yanke, they presumably carry his mark. Any high-ranked artificer will have a habit of placing their mark on their products. If someone finds out that I have one of the personal weapons of the Jin family, I might have to suffer the consequences. At my level of cultivation, I dare not to be rash.
“But that spatial ring appears rather inconspicuous. If I take it, no one will recognize it. Thus, no matter how much I want a spatial weapon, I can’t choose the option. I can only take option two.”
Yu Hua felt sullen. He had used the high-class products in the spatial ring to tempt Xia Fei, but he had forgotten a most basic problem. While those were excellent products, their origins were easily exposed, so the gains did not make up for the losses.
Looking at Furball, Yu Hua smiled. “It’s settled, then. Once we get back, I’ll personally refine Darkness Metal. Once it’s done, I’ll give you one-third.”
Xia Fei harmlessly smiled. “I’ll leave this to you.”
After moving the contents into his spatial ring, Yu Hua threw the golden ring over to Xia Fei. “It’s got quite a lot of space, around ten thousand cubic meters.”
Xia Fei was astonished. Ten thousand cubic meters? That was ten times more than his current ring!
He stroked a finger across the ring. Sure enough, Yu Hua had actually given a conservative estimate. This ring was able to hold at least twelve thousand cubic meters!
“Yu Hua seems like a rather decent person. Anyone else would’ve just killed you, and there’s no need to split anything with you. What a nice guy! After all, this is a spatial ring with twelve thousand cubic meters of space!” Phantom said into Xia Fei’s ear.
Xia Fei indifferently said, “Let’s wait and see. Even if he means me no harm, it will be best to be on my guard. I don’t like people whom I can’t see through.”
Phantom pursed his lips. “I think that Yu Hua’s rather nice. Don’t forget that it’s because of him that you could come to the Law Realm.”
Xia Fei lightly petted Furball. This fellow was in an excellent mood after eating a grade 3 Origin Crystal, vigorously nuzzling his chest.
“Because of Yu Hua or because of Furball? It’s hard to say,” Xia Fei muttered to himself. He was beginning to feel more and more certain that Yu Hua and Yu Jiang had invited him because of Furball. After all, his seventh brain region had been severely damaged, and he had essentially been trash. Great Law Emperors like Yu Jiang and Yu Hua had to have known this.
Waving his hands, Yu Hua said, “I still need to rest for a few days. Use this time to try for the level 6 threshold. That one is very difficult”, Yu Hua mysteriously said after changing the topic, “but with my help, that puny threshold is no problem at all. I have a trick that can accelerate your breakthrough. Do you want to know?”
Xia Fei was stunned. A trick to accelerate his breakthrough? If there really was a trick, it would be far too valuable to a Law Warrior!
Level 6 was incredibly difficult to reach, with many adepts going their entire lives without success, and Yu Hua was planning to tell that secret to Xia Fei?!
“Well? Didn’t I say that Yu Hua means you no harm? He even wants to teach you a trick to reach level 6!” Phantom smugly said.
Xia Fei frowned, muttering to himself, “Could Yu Hua really not mean me harm? Am I really being too paranoid?”



Chapter-538-Promoting-to-Become-a-Law-Elite
Chapter 538: Promoting to Become a Law Elite 
Yu Hua once more entered a recovery state as he silently leaned against the side of the mountain.
Xia Fei used this time to raise his cultivation to a new level.
Level 6 was a dividing line for a Law Adept. At level 6, one’s cultivation would receive a major boost, and one would receive the title of Elite Law Warrior!
Just like how Great Law Emperor Yu Hua could defeat two Law Emperors, there existed an impassable chasm between warriors and elites. Many people would fall before this natural barrier. Could Xia Fei rely on Yu Hua’s secret trick to break through that threshold?
The first pattern gradually formed in his mind, and without rest, Xia Fei moved onto the second, third, fourth, and fifth!
This was like a sprinter doing warm-up runs. Xia Fei repeated the process from the first to the sixth totem over and over, and the moment he felt himself lacking, he would immediately stop and restart from the beginning!
The effects were obvious as the sixth rank of the Space law became clearer and clearer!
Sprint!
Sprint again!
Xia Fei had tried this countless times when cultivating his speed ability. He had never imagined that the secret to advancing in the Space law would be like sprinting, using the inertia from one’s past attempts to charge through the threshold!
This also had an obvious advantage. Each attempt at level 6 meant repeating the previous five thresholds, reviewing the old to learn the new. Through constant review, Xia Fei’s strength was consolidated.
There was also an obvious disadvantage: energy consumption!
Yes, each sprint would rapidly consume energy. On average, he would spend one grade 3 Origin Crystal an hour!
This was a massive number! Ordinary Law Adepts could never bear this price! Even if they understood the secret, they would find it difficult to apply it, for they simply did not have the crystals.
Fortunately, Xia Fei had a rather abundant store of crystals, at least enough to get him through level six. As for afterward, only God knew.
A short twenty-four hours later, Xia Fei was one-third of the way to level 6. This advancing speed could be considered mad. Xia Fei was immersed in cultivation, unaware of the rising and setting of the sun.
With another step, he would possess even greater power.
His desire for power was at its maximum, and Xia Fei grew more and more excited.
Yu Hua was very quiet. Occasionally, he would open his eyes and look over at Xia Fei and Furball. One was a natural warrior with a 100% open seventh brain region and another was a crafty holy beast.
There was an imperceptible smile on his lips. He seemed to feel happy over Xia Fei’s cultivation speed. When he saw Xia Fei, he seemed to see a younger version of himself.
Closing his eyes, Yu Hua adjusted his mindset and muttered to himself, “Now is not the time; not yet…”
…
“Break!” As Xia Fei shouted, that level 6 threshold that Law Adepts considered a natural barrier shattered.
Standing up and looking around, Xia Fei felt a powerful energy surging out of his seventh brain region. It was like water spilling out of a broken dam which coursed through his entire body!
Yu Hua opened his eyes and counted off with his fingers. “Only four days! You needed only four days to reach level 6! I really don’t know what to say about this speed. Are you a genius or a madman?”
Xia Fei did not answer, overcome with joy and pleasure from this sensation of strength.
“I learned this way to break through the level 6 threshold in my youth. This method can only be used once. When you reach level 9 and attempt to break into Law Sovereign, you must not use this method, or else it will do more harm than good.”
Xia Fei nodded. “Then what’s the shortcut for advancing to Law Sovereign?”
Yu Hua smiled. “There’s no such thing as shortcuts in this world. It’s only a matter of method. Back then, I was lost on the road to level 6 for an entire year before finding this workable secret technique. Efforts and enlightenment have always been necessities on the path of laws.
“As for the secret art to reaching Law Sovereign, I will also teach it to you, but not now.”
Xia Fei’s opinion of Yu Hua had greatly changed. Even though this unscrupulous merchant had many secrets and had an arrogant and wild side, who did not?
People had many faces, and was Xia Fei not also hiding a violent warrior personality behind his smiling face, a dagger held behind his back?
As long as that person meant him no harm, Xia Fei would even make friends with a chaos-sowing demon king.
A man with no likes or passions was not someone one could have deep relationships with. At the very least, Xia Fei now knew of Yu Hua’s other face. Those fellows who hid their true selves very well were even more likely to draw Xia Fei’s suspicion.
“I still need to rest for three days. Consolidate your efforts for a bit. After three days, we’ll go and pay Dark Ghost a personal visit!” Yu Hua sternly said.
Xia Fei was startled. “You’ve already found Dark Ghost’s base?”
Yu Hua nodded. “I’ve found someone who can take us close. Dark Ghost’s ship moves around constantly, but he still needs to do business and has to interact with other drug peddlers.”
After saying this, Yu Hua closed his eyes again. Xia Fei had just broken into level 6, and he was actually rather tired. He did not continue cultivating and instead began studying martial techniques.
To Xia Fei, studying martial techniques took less of his seventh brain region, so it could be considered a sort of break.
Using studying martial techniques to take a break? Only a madman like Xia Fei would do such a thing.
…
In the black sea of stars, Dark Ghost’s barge concealed itself within an asteroid belt.
“Success! I’ve finally succeeded!” Dark Ghost held up a bottle of golden liquid in excitement.
Xia Fei’s brain-healing medicine had been like a curse, causing any pharmacological analysis machine to break down, which had caused Dark Ghost an enormous loss, but Dark Ghost was a Master Apothecary with some skills of his own. Purely through the most primitive analysis methods, he had managed to find the recipe.
Master Ghost, don’t you think that this concoction is a bit different from Xia Fei’s?” Yu Guhe uneasily said. “Xia Fei’s is light yellow, while yours is golden, and the scent is also stronger…”
Dark Ghost glared at the Yu brothers. “Cut the chatter! The ingredients are the same, so how could there be a problem? I used only the best of ingredients, so the scent will naturally be thicker and the color brighter!”
Despite these words, Dark Ghost had no confidence. Xia Fei’s recipe was so bizarre that even his most advanced analysis machine broke. Moreover, the ingredients were all lethal. This was the first time Dark Ghost had encountered such a wicked drug.
He looked around unpleasantly at his subordinates. Mu Linbai shivered while Yuan Dian, who had bandages tied around his arm, quickly looked the other way. As for the Yu brothers, they were so scared that they started trembling.
It must be said that the Yu brothers were quite unfortunate. Everything from the moment they stole Xia Fei’s medicine up to now had been a nightmare. They planned to make big money once Dark Ghost found the recipe, but all they did was cause Dark Ghost to break his precious analytical instruments and almost go broke!
Dark Ghost had been so angry that he had sent Mu Linbai and Yuan Dian, both Law Sovereigns, to capture Xia Fei, but in the end, Yuan Dian had been heavily injured. If not for Dark Ghost’s astonishing medical skill, he might have even died!
All of the blame was put to the Yu brothers, and they had spent the last few days under house arrest, each day like a year.
“You, come and test this medicine!” Dark Ghost thrust a finger and tyrannically proclaimed.
Yu Qinghe was so scared that he almost pissed his pants. Pointing at himself, he said, “Master Ghost, my brain region isn’t damaged.”
“Enough nonsense. You’re the one who brought the medicine. If you’re not trying it, who? You expect me to test it on my subordinates?”
Yu Qinghe’s face turned dark. He was truly unfortunate. If he had known that this would happen, he would have never stolen Xia Fei’s medicine. What he had thought was a chance at fortune had really been a ticking time bomb! Now, the disaster had finally come to him.
Yu Qinghe, who knew that several lethal ingredients were part of this recipe, naturally refused to drink it no matter what.
Dark Ghost ordered Mu Linbai to force it down Yu Qinghe’s throat, and his nose was pinched so that it could be poured straight down.
“Hot! So hot!”
Yu Qinghe’s face turned red, and he began tearing his clothes.
*Crack!*
He bared his upper body like a crazy man, becoming frantic, and his eyes began to turn red.
*Plush!*
He vomited blood!
Yu Qinghe wiped at his mouth and dejectedly howled, “Blood! It’s blood!”
*Thump!*
After howling a few times, he suddenly fell over with blood pouring out of his ears, nose, mouth, and eyes. It was an extremely gruesome death!
Dark Ghost walked over and inspected Yu Qinghe’s body, muttering to himself, “How did he die? The recipe is completely right! What’s the problem?”
He had no idea that Xia Fei’s drug-making method was essentially its own school, the mixing method a secret which was impossible to reproduce!
Just knowing the recipe was not enough and did not provide the means of reaching the true medicine.
Yu Guhe, Yu Qinghe’s brothers, had been scared silly. He dropped to the floor, his face pale, overcome with regret for stealing Xia Fei’s medicine.
“I don’t believe it!
“I refuse to believe that a puny Law Warrior who’s not even an Apothecary can surpass me in this field!”
Dark Ghost went crazy!
He was a genius—a genius at concocting wicked drugs. Xia Fei’s medicine had given him his greatest predicament. There was no making sense of it! It was a bizarre and insane medicine!
At this moment, a white-haired one-eyed elder walked into Dark Ghost’s laboratory. Upon seeing him, everyone lowered their heads. Even Dark Ghost stopped shouting, becoming extremely quiet.
“Master Cruel Eagle, you came at just the right time. I can’t keep waiting any longer. Please, you must help me go to the Yu family and capture that Xia Fei chap! If I don’t unlock the secret to this medicine, I’m gonna go crazy!” Dark Ghost ripped at his hair and roared.
Cruel Eagle had brilliant eyes which exuded a dignity that could not be profaned.
“There’s no need to go,” Cruel Eagle coldly said. “Their people are already on the upper floor. It won’t be long before they get here.”
Everyone was stunned. Dark Ghost questioned, “How did they get here? How many?”
“Two, one a Law Emperor. They opened a Spatial Gate and forced their way in.”
Mu Linbai frowned. “Yu Jiang? That’s a problem. That old man is a Law Emperor. None of us is a match to him.”
Cruel Eagle shook his head. “If it’s Yu Jiang, I would leave already. I don’t have the strength to fight against a peak Law Emperor. The one who came is Yu Hua, his family’s other Law Emperor.”
“Yu Hua? Didn’t he stop concerning himself with his family’s affairs a while ago?” Yuan Dian asked as he began to untie the bandages around his arm.
*Bang!*
As he spoke, the doors to the laboratory blew open!
Yu Hua and Xia Fei stood side by side, their eyes dark and sinister.
Striding forward, Xia Fei pointed his finger at the people in the laboratory, coldly asking, “I heard that someone wanted to capture me?”



Chapter-539-The-Lost-Law
Chapter 539: The Lost Law 
“I heard that someone wanted to capture me?” Xia Fei coldly said as he pointed. “I’m standing right here! Anyone who wants my life can try and take it!”
Arrogance!
Unconcealed arrogance!
His eyes were brimming with killing intent!
Dark Ghost coldly grunted. “Men, where are you?! Seize this scoundrel at once!”
Xia Fei smiled. “Stop shouting. You’re the only ones alive on this ship now. You should feel fortunate!”
“What?!” Dark Ghost was stunned. This barge had a crew of more than one thousand; of which, three hundred were warriors. After all, he had been wanted for a long time and had to be prepared at all times.
Within the space of several minutes, Yu Hua and Xia Fei had killed all of them! This was a one-sided massacre!
Mu Linbai and Yuan Dian were aching to fight, particularly Yuan Dian. After being injured by the backlash from Xia Fei’s Law of Primal Chaos, he had been harboring a grudge that he was anxious to return.
Cruel Eagle frowned. He was the only Law Emperor under Dark Ghost, and facing Yu Hua was a duty he could not avoid, but Yu Hua was a man who was smile whiling as he held a knife behind his back, and this sort of attitude left him feeling very uneasy. It was as if Yu Hua was certain of his victory.
“Cruel Eagle?” Yu Hua came out and spoke first.
“Yes,” Cruel Eagle sternly replied.
Yu Hua smiled. “It’s difficult to become a Law Emperor, so leave. I’ll let you live.”
Cruel Eagle’s sole eye flashed. Yu Hua’s words had stimulated his fighting intent. “For what reason?”
“No reason. This is a grudge between Xia Fei and Dark Ghost. If you don’t interfere, I won’t interfere.”
“And if I don’t agree?” Cruel Eagle frowned and asked.
With a flip of his palm, the Seven Dragons Split the Heavens technique appeared!
“Seven Dragons Split the Heavens!” Cruel Eagle was stunned. “So you’re a Great Law Emperor!”
Yu Hua smiled and nodded.
With a bitter chuckle, Cruel Eagle said, “With my strength, I have no chance at victory against a Great Law Emperor. Plus, your Yu family is most skilled in spatial tears, so I won’t fight with you.”
Yu Hua mused, “A man who knows when to adapt to circumstances will achieve great things.”
When experts fought, the results would be injury or death. Cruel Eagle was unwilling to fight with Yu Hua, leaving Dark Ghost’s group frantic and fuming.
“Cruel Eagle, I saved your life! You agreed to serve me for thirty years!” Dark Ghost loudly called.
Dark Eagle glanced at him. “I agreed that I would give you thirty years of my life, not all of it. Also, this is the Law Realm. You don’t really take promises seriously, do you?”
Dark Ghost became so infuriated that his face went white. On the side, Mu Linbai and Yuan Dian were aghast. Cruel Eagle was the strongest among them, a level 5 Law Emperor! Once he was gone, no one would be able to escape from Yu Hua’s clutches alive. After all, his level was far higher than theirs.
“It’s over! It’s all over!” Yu Guhe dejectedly sat down on the floor and began weeping, his voice suffused with despair.
Yu Hua patted Xia Fei on the shoulder. “I’ll leave this place to you. That night, it’s these two fellows who wanted to catch you, so they’re naturally your enemies. I remember you saying that you need to see your enemies die with your own eyes. Now, I’m giving you the chance to personally kill them.”
Xia Fei nodded, his face unperturbed.
Mu Linbai and Yuan Dian exhaled. If Yu Hua was not participating, then they really did not care about Xia Fei. After all, his level was extremely low, and while his attacks were infused with some bizarre power, it was not enough to hurt them. Yuan Dian had been defeated that night purely because of his carelessness.
After saying this, Yu Hua disappeared from the room with Cruel Eagle. Yu Hua was a Great Law Emperor and could use the skill of spatial traversal, taking with him anyone he wanted.
“Don’t think about trying to leave using a Spatial Compass; I’ve already locked down the entire ship,” Yu Hua said before leaving.
Yuan Dian heartily laughed. “Leave? If I don’t kill this brat, I’ll never be able to stomach this rage!”
Savagely glaring at Xia Fei, Mu Linbai and Yuan Dian planned to strike together.
…
Among the stars, Yu Hua and Cruel Eagle floated. Cruel Eagle frowned. “You said that you would let me go.”
Yu Hua smiled and pointed at Dark Ghost’s barge down below.
“There’s no rush. I’ll let you watch a good show first.”
Cruel Eagle shook his head. “The young man you brought won’t be able to beat Mu Linbai and Yuan Dian. His cultivation is too lacking. By leaving him behind, you have delivered him to his death.”
Yu Hua heartily laughed. “Do you really think so?”
“Although I only have one eye, I have always had a sharp insight when it comes to people.”
“Then I’m afraid that you will be disappointed today. Xia Fei isn’t as simple as you think he is.”
Cruel Eagle pursed his lips and said no more.
Yu Hua replied, “Just watch the show. You’ll understand once it’s over.”
On the ship, Mu Linbai and Yuan Dian began to flank Xia Fei.
Dark Ghost furiously roared on the side, “Yu Hua won’t let us off. Since we’re all dead, anyway, let’s take this brat down with us!”
Xia Fei sighed, lightly saying, “I didn’t come to the Law Realm to be dragged down by anyone. Tell me why you wanted to capture me, or else I’ll kill you!”
“With just you?” Mu Linbai scornfully said. “Just a mere level 4 Law Warrior. Yuan Dian had only lost to you because he was caught off guard.”
Yuan Dian glared at Mu Linbai, apparently not liking that this wound was being pried open again.
“Level 6,” Xia Fei used his hands to draw a ‘6’ in the air.
Everyone was stunned. Such divine advancement speed! Xia Fei’s advancement speed could almost be drawn as a straight line. He was breaking through so many thresholds that he would soon reach the heavens if this kept up!
All of this had happened within the span of only a dozen or so days.
“Impossible! No one can advance that quickly!” said Yuan Dian, his eyes red.
Xia Fei did not answer. He disdained answering such questions!
“What does level 6 matter? This old man is a Law Sovereign!”
The irascible Yuan Dian struck first, his hands turning into blades and moving like lightning!
“Wildstorm!”
Xia Fei clenched his hands into fists and took Yuan Dian’s attacks head-on!
“Break for me!”
His fists stirred up gales, infused with an inexplicable power!
Yuan Dian suddenly recalled the backlash from his lightning ability and hastily retreated, at the same time drawing back his ability. As the saying went, getting bitten by a snake once would make one afraid of a rope for ten years. Yuan Dian had already suffered once at Xia Fei’s hands, so he did not dare clash directly against him again!
Mu Linbai frowned. He regarded Yuan Dian’s panic with extreme disdain.
“Three Sovereigns of the Proud Moon!”
Three crescent-shaped waves of light attacked Xia Fei like three sharp blades!
Xia Fei was well aware that these were not light or blades but rather the power of the Space law!
“Chain Blockade!”
Four tornadoes went up to meet them!
Xia Fei had already cultivated the Chain Blockade technique to stage 4, and together with a massive boost in strength, it came with an extra tornado!
*Rumble!*
It was also the power of the Space law, but Mu Linbai was a level 3 Law Sovereign, so he was naturally stronger than Xia Fei!
However, the result would make one want to crush their glasses!
Xia Fei’s tornadoes engulfed the crescent blades and annihilated them! They were far stronger than Mu Linbai’s attacks!
*Whoosh~*
The wind was slightly weakened, but it continued in the same direction, surging toward Mu Linbai!
“Not good!”
Mu Linbai paled in shock and swiftly moved to dodge.
*Rumble!*
With a boom, the laboratory’s alloy ceiling was torn up! The massive barge shuddered!
In space, Cruel Eagle grimaced. “Such a powerful attack. It seems like I have underestimated Xia Fei. Although he’s a Law Warrior, he can completely match a Law Sovereign’s offensive might!”
Yu Hua happily nodded. “Correct. Xia Fei’s strength has truly reached the level of Law Sovereigns, but don’t you find his attacks strange?”
Yu Hua’s eyes flashed with a cunning light as he asked.
Cruel Eagle replied, “Strange, yes, definitely. The Space law should not possess this sort of formidable offensive power. Many clans and warriors cultivate the Space law, but I’ve never heard of anyone who could make this law so dominating. It is as if Xia Fei’s law energy has some special attribute that can subvert and disrupt the attacks of others, neutralizing them upon first contact.”
Yu Hua wondered a loud, “Could Xia Fei be adding another law into his Space law?”
Cruel Eagle shook his head. “It’s possible. There are two circumstances in which the attack can become this powerful. The first is that the Law Adept has comprehended a new principle and the second is that he has added in another law.
“Everyone knows that the Three Great Laws stand proudly over the universe, with the others being known as minor laws or support laws. It is not easy to merge a minor law with a great law, and not every law that can be merged. This is because laws often repel one another naturally. I do not know of any support law that can boost his offensive might this much, so this should be some new power that Xia Fei comprehended from the Space law!
“It’s truly an epiphany that others would envy greatly. If he is allowed to continue, perhaps Xia Fei could really found his own faction and develop a new kind of law power. Even advancing into the God race is not out of the realm of possibility!”
Cruel Eagle seemed very excited, but Yu Hua could not get excited at all.
“Could it be the long-lost Time law?” Yu Hua suggested.
Cruel Eagle immediately turned wary at these words, looking uneasily at him.
Yu Hua smiled. “Cruel Eagle, we all know that only two of the Three Great Laws are still extant. The most important Law of Time has been lost to the ages, while your original name is Wanyan Yudu, and you’re a member of the Wanyan family.
“It is said that the Wanyans were the last ones to have any interaction with the Law of Time. As a successor, did you never have a chance to interact with the Law of Time?”
Yu Hua shot him a profound gaze. “I mean no harm. I happen to have learned of your real identity from a friend, and since we’ve had a chance meeting, I asked for your help to understand why Xia Fei’s law attacks are so powerful.”
Cruel Eagle, or perhaps one could call him Wanyan Yudu, scowled. Having his real identity exposed was not a good thing to him.
“When I was young, I saw my grandfather use the Law of Time, so I can be sure that Xia Fei’s attack doesn’t contain the power of it.”
“So you’re saying that the Wanyan family really did find the Law of Time?”
Cruel Eagle let out a long sigh. “I wish that our clan had never possessed that wicked law; otherwise, the Wanyan family wouldn’t have been wiped out, I wouldn’t have lost an eye, and I wouldn’t have needed to spend my childhood wandering around for fear of my life.
“Xia Fei isn’t using the Time law, and I can’t use it, either. This is because the Wanyan Clan was wiped out when I was very young and I hadn’t yet reached the age where I could study it.”
Yu Hua shook his head. “So you’re saying that you have no more use.”
Cruel Eagle was shocked. “You said you would let me go!”
“This is the Law Realm. Did you really take my words seriously?” Yu Hua coldly sneered, returning the words Cruel Eagle had said to Dark Ghost several minutes ago.
“I kept you around to see if you could recognize what law Xia Fei has been using. Since you couldn’t, you can die now!”
Yu Hua’s eyes erupted with killing intent!



Chapter-540-Foundry-City
Chapter 540: Foundry City 
*Rumble!*
Mu Linbai flew backward, blood spurted out of his mouth!
Level 2 of the Law of Primal Chaos was so strong that Mu Linbai, a mighty level 3 Law Sovereign, could not take even one punch from Xia Fei!
A spiral appeared on his chest where the blow connected, his flesh torn apart, his bones and organs shattered to bits!
It was as if some high-speed energy had been infused into Xia Fei’s steely fist, and this energy did not move in a straight trajectory but twisted, instead!
This was the wondrous attribute of the Law of Primal Chaos. It did not appear to have any sort of rule. This power simply did its utmost to tear apart the defenses of others, sowing chaos and rendering everything incredibly fragile!
As fresh blood flowed from his mouth, Mu Linbai’s white clothes were drenched in red. After painfully twitching a little, he finally stopped breathing.
Only Dark Ghost and Yu Guhe were left in the laboratory. Yu Guhe was curled up in a corner, his head lowered. At this point, his fate was sealed, and he had given up on resistance.
Dark Ghost gnashed his teeth and angrily glared at Xia Fei, his face truly as white as a ghost.
“Talk! There’s nothing between us, so why did you want to capture me?” Xia Fei coldly asked.
Dark Ghost and Yu Guhe were both very weak and could not threaten Xia Fei, so he let down his guard and lit a cigarette for himself.
Yu Guhe became heartbroken upon hearing Xia Fei’s question and immediately began to weep in regret.
“So noisy!”
*Crack!*
Xia Fei aimed his right fist at Yu Guhe’s chest and punched, penetrating through his heart and leaving a giant hole.
Dark Ghost’s face paled and he grimaced. Not only was Xia Fei a superb apothecary, he was vicious and ruthless, too! Striking without mercy!
At this moment, a massive explosion came from space. Yu Hua and Cruel Eagle were already battling, the energy of the Space and Matter laws clashing with each other to create a light which outshone the stars.
Xia Fei was startled. Why had Yu Hua and Cruel Eagle started fighting? A few minutes ago, Yu Hua appeared prepared to let Cruel Eagle go out of respect for his peer.
Xia Fei did not suspect Yu Hua too much; instead, he reckoned that Cruel Eagle had changed his mind, which led to the two fighting against each other.
Yu Hua had treated him rather well, teaching him a secret art to pass through the threshold and even giving him a portion of the precious Darkness Metal. In Xia Fei’s view, these were all signs of friendship.
*Whoosh!*
After a few rounds, Cruel Eagle saw that he was clearly no match for Yu Hua and frantically made to flee. Yu Hua pursued him without hesitation, and the two of them swiftly disappeared into the darkness of space.
While Xia Fei was watching Yu Hua’s battle with Cruel Eagle, Dark Ghost was not just sitting around. He had silently removed a bottle of black medicine from his ring.
Turning his head, Xia Fei shrugged. A battle between Law Emperors was an apex clash which was a joy to watch, and it was also a valuable learning experience, but now that Yu Hua and Cruel Eagle had drifted far from sight, Xia Fei felt rather helpless as he could not watch their battle anymore.
Raising the bottle high over his head, Dark Ghost’s expression turned savage!
“Die, Xia Fei!”
Dark Ghost moved to smash the bottle of black liquid on the ground, but though he moved quickly, Xia Fei moved even faster!
*Whoosh~*
Xia Fei vanished, and the moment before the bottle hit the ground, Xia Fei appeared, caught the bottle, and gave Dark Ghost a slap!
*Smack!*
A clear handprint appeared on the left side of Dark Ghost’s face, and four teeth along with some blood came out of his mouth.
Dark Ghost did not have much when it came to martial arts, and Xia Fei’s slap had him sprawling on the ground and seeing stars.
“It seems to be some sort of poison. Dark Ghost wanted to break it on the floor and take you with him!” Phantom said as he looked at the black liquid in Xia Fei’s hand.
“How vicious!” Xia Fei broke out in a cold sweat, and he swiftly stored the bottle in his ring.
Walking up to Dark Ghost’s side, Xia Fei clamped two fingers on one of Dark Ghost’s fingers.
*Pa!*
The finger and the spatial ring on it were plucked off!
The fingers were connected to the heart, and Dark Ghost howled in pain as blood flowed out of his hand.
“I’ll ask you one last time: Why did you want to capture me?” Xia Fei frowned and asked.
Dark Ghost moaned in pain as he told Xia Fei about how the Yu brothers had gotten their hands on Xia Fei’s medicine, how his medicine had drawn his interest, and how it had destroyed several of his valuable analysis machines.
Xia Fei laughed as he listened. A medicine without a blocker? Did these people really take him for some novice?
Xia Fei’s way of mixing medicine was completely unconventional. He had chosen the most lethal of ingredients, demanding the most heaven-defying and rigorous of recipes. These people had wanted to reverse-engineer it? Was this not seeking ill fortune?
Once he knew the story, Xia Fei could not help but sigh at how fraught the Law Realm was with dangers.
It was just a minor matter, but because Dark Ghost’s group had become involved, it had become a big mess. Xia Fei secretly made up his mind to be more cautious in the future. In this man-eat-man world, anyone could hold a grudge for anything. Inconspicuousness remained king. After all, Xia Fei still was not some well-known individual at this time.
Xia Fei had become displeased when he saw Cruel Eagle see Yu Hua and immediately go back on his promise, particularly those words of his: “This is the Law Realm! You don’t really take promises seriously, do you?”
Those words continued to linger in his mind. It seemed like promises in the Law Realm were no more than charades. Humans who sought things for their benefits while avoiding trouble was the true guiding principle in the Law Realm.
Xia Fei was only a small warrior who had just entered the Law Realm. These battles and experiences were causing him to mature rapidly and grow accustomed gradually to this man-eat-man environment.
*Swish!*
With a light swipe of October Flying Snow, Dark Ghost’s head was separated from his body. Xia Fei had completed his promise to watch his enemies die, and Dark Ghost ceased to exist within the Law Realm.
Yu Hua and Cruel Eagle were still fighting, so Xia Fei began gathering the spoils.
With no time to look at the contents, Xia Fei began taking the rings from Dark Ghost’s people.
“A high-speed centrifuge! A particle purifier!” Phantom was elated. He loved drug-makers, and this Dark Ghost truly lived up to his reputation as an underground apothecary. All of the equipment he used was very high-class and advanced, and there was a great number of them. After all, his drug production was at an almost factory level. He had several dozen high-speed centrifuges.
While gathering the spoils, Xia Fei also looked through the spatial rings, making several surprising discoveries. In crystals alone, there were 171 valuable grade 4 Origin Crystals!
Xia Fei was elated and threw Furball a grade 3 Origin Crystal. He had come away with a rich harvest this time, and Furball’s boat had also been lifted by the rising tide, and he had giving it grade 3 Origin Crystals for food. What made Xia Fei uneasy was that Furball could drain all of the vast energy stored in a grade 3 Origin Crystal very quickly. His appetite was just too good. How many crystals would he have to consume to promote by a single level? Perhaps even all the crystals in the world might not be enough.
“The total value sums up to 375 grade 4 crystals. Converted to grade 3 crystals, that’s a total of 37,500 crystals! That’s not even counting the law weapons and other valuable machines! This money is enough to last us for a very long time!” Phantom excitedly said.
Xia Fei nodded. With this money, he would no longer need to count every crystal and could spend much more freely from here on out.
*Whoosh~*
Yu Hua suddenly appeared in front of Xia Fei, calm and relaxed. It appeared that Cruel Eagle had not given him much difficulty, and he had easily dispatched him.
Glancing around at the empty barge, Yu Hua smiled. “My good man, you’ve basically ransacked the place. You’re even taking the herbs?”
Xia Fei smiled awkwardly. “There’s nothing to be done. Cultivating every day takes too much energy, so I took anything that’s worth even a bit so that I can trade it for money later.”
Yu Hua replied, “True. What warriors lack the most is energy, and it’s not every day you get to pillage the base of a drug lord. You’re in the crucial initial phase of a warrior, so storing away a little money can only be of benefit to you. Besides, it’s about time you change your equipment. You’re an Elite Law Warrior now, so you can’t go out looking too unsightly.”
Xia Fei pouted. “Aren’t my items high enough of a grade? Almost all of them are Eternal rank, and some are even Immortal rank.”
Changing equipment naturally meant spending money, but Xia Fei preferred to spend all his money on cultivating. No matter where one went, the equipment used by warriors was never cheap. Those prices in the tens of thousands made Xia Fei wince in pain.
Yu Hua replied, “This is the Law Realm, so don’t think your items from before will do you any good. The most important thing about equipment here isn’t what grade it is, but what sort of law is attached to it and the level of that law.
“You’ve seen Yuan Dian’s round shield, yes? A rather ordinary item, but because it has the defensive power of a spatial barrier attached to it, its grade is several times higher! That’s the sort of thing you need.”
Glancing at the several spatial rings in Xia Fei’s hand, Yu Hua said, “Forget it. Just keep those things you took from Dark Ghost and his men. I’ll take you to see what a true warrior’s equipment looks like! You may even be able to use this money to buy one or two nice things for yourself.”
Xia Fei felt helpless. He did not know how much law weapons cost, but from Yu Hua’s tone, the price was probably horrifying. However, it was rare for him to have an opportunity to leave the Yu family and look around, and weapons were necessities for warriors, so even if he did not buy, it would be fine to take a look.
“Why did Cruel Eagle start fighting you?” Xia Fei asked, changing the subject.
Yu Hua shrugged. “I have no idea. I was originally planning to spare him, but that fellow was too sinister. While I wasn’t paying attention, he tried getting me by surprise. I couldn’t spare him after that.”
Xia Fei did not doubt this story. He could see at a glance that Cruel Eagle was a sinister fellow, without even realizing that the truly sinister one was standing right in front of him.
…
Unlike Casa, this was a bustling and beautiful planet.
The streets were lined with ancient trees, tall and dignified. Exquisitely constructed buildings were packed together, brimming with style, expressing the wealth and refinement of their owners.
“This is Foundry City, a very famous base of artificers in the circle. Fifty percent of the people living here are artificers or people connected to the work of creating weapons. If you want to buy something real good, then this is the right place.”
Artificers were not blacksmiths. One needed to be a high-ranking law user who could imbue law energy into a weapon and make it into a law weapon!
Becoming an artificer was very difficult. Once one succeeded, one would be able to enjoy endless glory and fortune. Artificers were even more valuable than Energy Masters. This was because what Energy Masters produced was currency, energy, and money, but money might be unable to get one a high-class law weapon.
The streets were lined with stores selling law weapons, and the signs would often carry both the store name and the cultivation of the artificer.
For example: Law of Space Level 3 Sovereign, Artificer Zhang Baoquan’s Best Service. Law of Matter Level 7 Sovereign, Artificer Kevin’s Supreme Weapons…
Each store would have at least one artificer, with the larger ones having several!
Xia Fei’s eyes shone brightly. There were so many artificers, and so many law weapons!



Chapter-541-White-Jade-Ape
Chapter 541: White Jade Ape 
It was no wonder that Foundry City was a base for artificers. There were several hundred weapon stores of various sizes here, and even more derivative businesses, like pawn shops and auction houses, could be found.
Seeing so many law weapons for the first time, Xia Fei almost fainted from shock.
Yu Hua brought Xia Fei to a place called the Fourth Great Uncle Comprehensive Exchange, pointing at the sign and saying, “Fourth Uncle can be considered a first-class individual of Foundry City. His original surname is Xu, and just like me, he’s obsessed with doing business. He’s been running this store in Foundry City for quite a few years now. It will be best if you trade in the things you have into crystals and then use them to buy law weapons.”
Xia Fei nodded. Those high-speed centrifuges could not be spent like money, and even if he needed to make medicine, just one would be enough. Bringing around too many useless things would just be a burden.
Once they entered, Yu Hua went straight to Fourth Great Uncle’s office as if he was an old hand. Most of the people who worked here were also members of the Yu family. They energetically greeted Yu Hua, their attitudes rather respectful.
In the office, Xia Fei encountered the boss of this exchange, the Fourth Great Uncle. This was a fatty wearing glasses, impeccably dressed in a western suit, several jeweled rings flashing on his fingers. He presented the classical figure of a successful businessman.
“Yu Hua, what wind blew you to my door?” The Fourth Great Uncle stood up from his chair with some difficulty and called to Yu Hua.
Yu Hua smiled and said, “Nothing at all! Couldn’t I just come and see my fourth uncle? I heard our sixth sister is finally about to get married. As an older brother, I have to deliver a congratulatory gift.”
Though the Fourth Great Uncle was without sons, he had seven daughters; of which, only his sixth, who had an extremely strong personality, was unmarried despite being over forty. This had left the Fourth Great Uncle’s entire family worried sick. Now that this old girl was finally leaving, the Fourth Great Uncle was very excited and his face was glowing red.
“That’s true. You’re the richest one in the clan, and it will be inexcusable for me not to get a little cut from you.” The Fourth Great Uncle was quite the entertainer, even joking that Yu Hua would buy a house as a wedding gift, but Yu Hua agreed without blinking an eye.
“This is Xia Fei, a new Law Warrior of my family. He has a few things that I will have to trouble your store to exchange for.” Yu Hua introduced.
The Fourth Great Uncle squinted his little eyes and then happily said, “So you’re Xia Fei! I heard about some excessively talented youth in the clan who managed to reach level 4 Law Warrior in only a month, even killing a Demon Chrysalis on his own. Extraordinary, extraordinary.”
Xia Fei said nothing. In the Law Realm, one’s lifespan frequently got into the hundreds. Yu Hua, though he appeared middle-aged, was probably more than a hundred, and it would even be appropriate for Xia Fei to call him grandfather. As for this Fourth Great Uncle, his seniority was even harder to estimate. For a moment, Xia Fei did not know how he should address this fat, old man.
Yu Hua softly laughed. “Fourth Uncle, what year is this news from? Xia Fei is already level 6, an Elite Law Warrior.”
The Fourth Great Uncle was flabbergasted. “Level 6! He’s advancing this quickly?”
Xia Fei gave a slight nod. Level was not money, and there was no point in hiding it.
The Fourth Great Uncle turned his head and looked at Yu Hua, a profound tone to his words as he spoke. “Back then, you made a record of taking twenty months to reach Law Sovereign, and then Little Bei came out of nowhere and turned that record into eighteen months. It seems like the record is going to change again.”
Yu Hua casually said, “It is a good thing for talented individuals to appear in the family. I really don’t care that others can break my record.”
The Fourth Great Uncle nodded. “That’s true. If a few more individuals like this appear in the clan, the Old Patriarch won’t need to hold things up all by himself anymore.”
A subtle gleam flashed in Yu Hua’s eyes as he softly said, “That’s true. It’s been very hard for the Old Patriarch, holding up the clan all by himself.”
“The people in the family all call me Fourth Great Uncle or Fourth Uncle Yu, and you can call me the same. If you have anything you want to trade, take them out now. Your fourth uncle is in a good mood today, so I’ll take everything you have and give you a good deal!”
Xia Fei nodded and handed over a ring that he had prepared beforehand.
Sending in his mental energy, Fourth Great Uncle said, “All of these are machines and ingredients used by apothecaries, and they’re quite a lot. You could start a factory with all these!”
Yu Hua chuckled. “Just a few spoils of war. Xia Fei has even more valuable things on hand. Take out those law weapons.”
Xia Fei frowned. “Wouldn’t it be better to keep the law weapons for myself?”
Yu Hua replied, “You don’t understand. Law Adepts primarily rely on their own cultivation to fight. Things like weapons shouldn’t be used unless absolutely necessary. Long-term use of a law weapon will create laziness and won’t benefit your cultivation.”
Xia Fei indicated that he understood. Law weapons were often forged by experts of high rank, so they possessed impressive power. A low-rank Law Warrior using a high-rank weapon would naturally be able to exhibit greater power, but this would also breed a dependent mindset.
“To a warrior, what’s needed in a weapon isn’t the quantity but rather the quality to decide victory in one blow. This is why many warriors will spare no expense to get a suitable weapon.”
The Fourth Great Uncle nodded. “Yu Hua is right. It’d be better to trade those weapons for a top-class one. At critical moments of a battle, a small difference in level might decide the outcome. Any weapon with special attributes and a high rank will be difficult to obtain, but once you do get one, it will provide more than just a simple multiplier to your fighting power!”
Xia Fei naturally understood this argument on weapons. After some thought, he came around to the idea. Since he had gone through so much trouble to collect all this money and resources, if he had the chance to trade them for one or two top-class products which could help him out in a pinch, it would obviously be better than having an entire basket-load of ordinary products.
Xia Fei took out the Lapis Killing Rain and Yuan Dian’s round shield. Besides that, he also took out some weapons that he did not frequently use, like the Immortal rank Butterfly Serpent.
Suddenly, as Xia Fei was exploring the contents of his spatial ring, he discovered something weird: a crystalline white ape.
This ring had contained all of Dark Ghost’s property, and it contained a variety of different items. Xia Fei had not gone through everything carefully before this, but now that he was starting to take things out, he discovered this strange ape.
He called it strange because when he released his mental energy onto the white jade ape, it produced a strange reaction. The mental energy that Xia Fei had scattered throughout the space suddenly began to converge. It seemingly had the ability to increase one’s focus by one hundred times.
‘It seems to be something good…’ Xia Fei thought to himself, deciding to leave this ape in the ring.
The Fourth Great Uncle looked at the law weapons Xia Fei had removed and said, “These weapons have rather decent grades, but none of them can be considered good quality. Weapons with an area of effect like the Lapis Killing Rain can be found in every store, so keeping it won’t do you much good. Selling them all for one or two quality products is the correct course of action.”
Seeing that the Fourth Great Uncle was sincere, Xia Fei said nothing. Everyone understood the principle that good steel was used on the blade, but Xia Fei just had no idea how much a quality law weapon would cost.
The Fourth Great Uncle called over a middle-aged manager and ordered, “Take all these things and exchange them for crystals. Try and get the best prices you can. We’re all brothers, so we won’t lose out in this as long as we come out even.”
The middle-aged man nodded in agreement. Taking the spatial rings, he went to the storehouse to check over the inventory and do the calculations.
Yu Hua smiled. “Fourth Uncle, do you have any top-class items available for selection?”
“It’s not like my main business is law weapons, so how can I have quality goods? A new store opened up in Foundry City calling itself Unique Pavilion. It has a grand built and sells only quality goods. You might as well go and look around.”
“Yu Hua stroked his chin. “Unique Pavilion from ‘unique and unmatched’. Quite the resplendent name, but who knows if they can really do it?”
Fourth Great Uncle mysteriously said, “I don’t know if the name matches the reality. After all, I’m not a warrior, so I only know a bit about law weapons. However, the tales say that this store sources its products from the Withered Mu Clan!”
“Withered Mu? That’s one of the Nine Great Clans!” Yu Hua gasped.
The Law Realm had many humans, and most of them lived in clans.
The nine most powerful families were known as the Nine Great Clans, and they were existences far above the Yu family.
These were the Brightsea Clan, the Withered Mu Clan, the Cruelwolf Clan, the Snowdrift Clan, the Moonward Clan, the Glacier Clan, the Shatter Wu Clan, the Nine Fan Clan, and the Noah Clan.
If the law weapons were really made by the Withered Mu Clan, they could not be lacking in grade. After all, the Nine Great Clans were second in status only to the two peak race standing at the top of the pyramid.
“However,” Fourth Great Uncle suddenly said, “while Unique Pavilion’s products are good, their prices are sky-high. The starting price of their weapons is one hundred grade 4 crystals!”
Xia Fei suddenly felt dizzy. One hundred grade 4 crystals could be converted to ten thousand grade 3 crystals, enough for him to cultivate for an entire year, but for Unique Pavilion, this was only the starting price!
Yu Hua smiled. “Quite interesting. Just the thought of a weapon produced by one of the Nine Great Clans makes one excited. Xia Fei, once things are done here, let’s go and take a look.”
Xia Fei nodded in agreement. The prices were truly astonishing, but Xia Fei could not help but be tempted to see what truly legendary top-class law weapons were like.
As before, Xia Fei took out tea leaves and other such specialties from his home and gifted them to the Fourth Great Uncle. The Fourth Great Uncle took the gifts with little hesitation, praising them as excellent tea after putting everything away.
It was not long before the middle-aged man returned, a list of items in his hand.
The Fourth Great Uncle had him read it out, and the middle-aged man cleared his throat and said, “Seventy-four high-speed centrifuges, each one with a converted value of fifteen grade 3 crystals. Thirty-one B-type purifiers, each one with a converted value of eight grade 3 crystals. Law weapon Shield of Solidification, with a converted value of 170 grade 3 crystals. Law weapon Silverwind War armor, with a converted value of 195 grade 3 crystals…
“In sum, a converted value of 53,129 grade 3 crystals,” the middle-aged man finally declared.
Yu Hua smiled. “Fourth Uncle is truly a generous soul. You’re going to take some losses on this trade.”
The Fourth Great Uncle smiled at Xia Fei. “We’re all family. Just call it the price of making a friend. Xia Fei, if you come across any rare items like the Demon Chrysalis, don’t forget about your fourth uncle here. I’ll definitely give you the highest price!”
Xia Fei repeatedly nodded his head and agreed to the affirmative.
Adding together with the crystals he had taken from Dark Ghost, Xia Fei’s fortune had soared to 913 grade 4 crystals. Xia Fei had the Fourth Great Uncle help him exchange six hundred grade 4 crystals and 31,300 grade 3 crystals, which he put away in his ring. After all, Xia Fei did not have a lot of situations where he would use grade 4 crystals, and he still relied on grade 3 crystals for cultivation.
Leaving the Fourth Great Uncle’s store, Yu Hua asked for directions and then headed off with Xia Fei to the mysterious Unique Pavilion.



Chapter-542-Unique-Pavilion
Chapter 542: Unique Pavilion 
Artificers were wealthy and respectable people, and Foundry City was a gathering place of artificers in the circle. Thus, both land and housing prices were extremely expensive.
Unique Pavilion was located on a large plot of land in the most bustling street of Foundry City, the Western Avenue. It was built in the style of a picturesque garden, and from it, one could see the wealth and power of its owner.
To Xia Fei’s surprise, such a famous and enormous store was rather deserted. There were three rows of parking spaces in front of the cinnabar gates, but only two or three small energy cars were parked there. However, there were quite a lot of employees wearing gray uniforms. At least thirty of them were lined up outside of the gates with respectful smiles on their faces.
Yu Hua and Xia Fei got up close, and six sales representatives immediately followed them. They did not say much, simply leading Yu Hua and Xia Fei through the gates, whereupon two graceful young women offered hot towels and tea, making it feel more like they were entering a luxury hotel. No one asked Xia Fei and Yu Hua what they were buying. All of their actions seemed very natural and not at all affected.
“A good trick,” Xia Fei smiled and said. “Businesses often talk about making their guests feel at home, but only a scant few are capable of it. This Unique Pavilion can be considered very experienced when it comes to customer service.”
Yu Hua nodded in agreement to Xia Fei’s words.
In the courtyard of Unique Pavilion, one would be even more inclined to clap their hands in praise. Every tree, plant, blade of grass, and tile was exquisitely placed and selected. Even the cobblestones paving the small lane running through the flowers were separated by less than a millimeter.
From these details, one could see that the owner of the store had pondered human tastes for a long while, and the arrangements were so intricate and fine that one could spend money here happily. It was as if this was the only proper place to spend one’s money.
While admiring the flowers, they arrived at the reception hall, and the entire way, not a single person asked Yu Hua and Xia Fei what they were buying. The employees led Xia Fei and Yu Hua to a large and warm sofa made of velvety material. After serving seven or eight kinds of fruits and snacks and a pot of excellent tea, the six employees withdrew.
Yu Hua and Xia Fei were somewhat bewildered. These people were seemingly in no rush to do business. Was there any business that left its guests alone in the reception hall?
A minute later, a young girl of seventeen or eighteen arrived with two maidservants.
“Honored guest, it was rude of me not to greet you outside. Please accept my apologies,” the young woman said with a smile.
This woman put on no airs, confidently sitting down across from Xia Fei and Yu Hua.
There was naturally nothing to criticize about her appearance or dress. From her bearing, one could instantly tell that she had a wealthy background. No one else could receive guests with such grace and poise.
Bearing was a very interesting thing. One could not just have it even if they wanted it. Without abundant experience, a pretty daughter from a humble family would never be able to become a girl of a wealthy one.
Seeing this girl made Xia Fei suddenly think of Avril. On their first meeting, Avril had still been young, naughty, and unruly. Over the last few years, she had gradually matured, and Avril gradually gained her bearing. It was rather similar to the one possessed by this girl before him. This was because while they both seemed elegant on the surface, there was a streak of mischief in their bones which could be easily noticed through their smiles or the occasional gleams in their eyes.
“This young miss is Mu Qingping, owner of the Unique Pavilion. May I ask your names?”
Xia Fei was startled. This girl had the surname Mu? Did that not mean that she was a member of the Withered Mu family, one of the Nine Great Clans?
The Mu family was famous. To be more precise, they were part of a higher circle than the Yu family, so why had this girl from that clan come all the way here to do business?
It had to be understood that businessmen did not have a high status in the Law Realm. Even Yu Hua had encountered much opposition for becoming a businessman, let alone a girl from the mighty Mu family.
“I did not think that the owner would be so young and beautiful. May I be so old to ask: Since you have the surname Mu, are you a member of the Withered Mu family?” Yu Hua asked.
Mu Qingping nodded. “I am. Where might you two be from?”
Yu Hua replied, “My surname is Yu, Yu Hua. This one is an Elite Law Warrior of our clan, Xia Fei.”
“Oh, so you are of the illustrious Yu family, the most skilled in the art of spatial tears.”
“Miss Mu thinks too highly of us.”
Yu Hua’s introduction had been met with the appropriate decorum, but Xia Fei felt like his name had been met by some disdain. In truth, Mu Qingping could not be blamed for this. While large clans would usually have members with different surnames, these outsider members did not have very high statuses and played unremarkable roles in their respective clans. In these clans which were maintained through blood relations, outsiders would find it very hard to be acknowledged. Mu Qingping considered Xia Fei a bodyguard or servant of the Yu family.
After going talking a big detour, with Yu Hua and Mu Qingping chatting for at least half an hour over meaningless subjects, they finally reached the topic of purchasing weapons.
“I won’t hide it from you. Ninety percent of Unique Pavilion’s weapons came from the Withered Mu family. Although a few other artificers have also sent over their products to put up for sale here, the number is small. Our Withered Mu Clan’s products have never been lacking, be it in terms of function or appearance. In coming to make your purchase, I guarantee that you will not be disappointed,” Mu Qingping rather proudly proclaimed.
Yu Hua firmly nodded. “The Nine Great Clans are the most outstanding families in the circle, so there is naturally nothing that can be criticized about the quality. However, this time, it is not me who has come to make a purchase but rather my little brother Xia Fei here. He is a newly promoted Law Warrior and needs one or two good weapons to protect himself.”
Mu Qingping glanced at Xia Fei with obvious disappointment. How could a newly promoted Law Warrior, who was also an outsider to the Yu family, have any money? If Xia Fei was really strong, he would not be staying in some other person’s family.
Xia Fei frowned. Mu Qingping’s attitude made him uncomfortable. Fortunately, she still kept up the appearance, talking and smiling.
“Gentlemen, please follow me,” Mu Qingping stood up and said.
Passing through the reception hall, they entered the rear garden, a splendid courtyard that was at least fifty acres in size. All kinds of plants vied with one another for beauty here, and it felt like one was standing in the middle of a fairyland.
“This place is Hundred Jade Garden. All of Unique Pavilion’s weapons are kept here.”
Xia Fei followed Mu Qingping’s finger and saw transparent display cabinets amid the flowers. Each cabinet contained a weapon or a set of weapons.
There was a pavilion with reclining chairs set up every one hundred steps so that one could rest, drink tea, and enjoy the view if they felt tired.
By putting display cabinets in a garden, Unique Pavilion could truly be said to possess consummate craftsmanship. By turning the cold process of selecting weapons into an elegant leisure activity, it catered precisely to the tastes of rich scions.
Xia Fei’s eyes brightened. When weapons were placed in front of him, he would not even give the most beautiful woman in the world a second glance. All of his attention was drawn to the display cabinets.
Yu Hua was not planning to buy any weapons this time, so he accompanied Mu Qingping in conversation. In a little while, he had gone some distance away from Xia Fei.
In Mu Qingping’s view, Yu Hua, a Law Emperor of the Yu family, was the true big customer, so she gave Xia Fei the cold shoulder.
“These are all excellent products! Look at that saber; it has law energy that can slice and shatter space, and its appearance is beautiful while its edge is sharp! It’s definitely a high-quality product!” Phantom excitedly said to Xia Fei.
Xia Fei frowned. While the weapons were good, for some reason, Xia Fei felt that they were all flawed in some way. It was as if the weapons were too fancy and too covered in finery, such that they seemed unreliable.
To him, weapons had only one purpose: take the lives of others.
Any sort of gaudiness, which had nothing to do with killing, was simply a burden and had no reason to exist.
Mu Qingping smiled, believing from Xia Fei’s furrowed brows that he had been scared away by the price. She had no idea that Xia Fei was not even thinking about price, looking only for a weapon that suited his tastes.
“Big Brother Xia Fei, this Spatial Lock Cloudheart is a very decent suit of protective armor, possessing the multi-aspect defensive power of the Law of Matter. Level 4 Law Sovereign, and it’s not expensive, only 124 grade 4 crystals.” Mu Qingping came up and made a sales pitch.
She was doing this out of goodwill. In truth, it was impossible to find cheap armor in Unique Pavilion. Xia Fei would only be more disappointed the more he kept looking. She could clearly see that Xia Fei did not come from a wealthy family, so Mu Qingping decided to select a suit of armor, which might be in his price range.
Xia Fei had no idea of Mu Qingping’s good intentions. He directly asked, “What’s the purpose of this cloud-shaped piece of armor on the shoulder?”
“This is a decoration. Don’t you think that adding this piece to the armor makes it very beautiful?”
Xia Fei frowned, insensitively asking, “Can beauty defend me?”
Mu Qingping frowned. “No.”
“What about this golden chain ring at the waist? Is this for defense?”
A vein bulged on Mu Qingping’s forehead, an unkind look surfacing in her eyes. “Not as well.”
“The breastplate mirror has been carved in the shape of a water lily. Does this boost its defense?”
“No.”
Mu Qingping was beginning to lose her patience. As a young lady of the Mu family, she had always grown up in a graceful and noble circle. She had never met someone as shortsighted as Xia Fei. It was as if the only thing that mattered to Xia Fei was practicality. He cared little for whether or not a suit of armor was beautiful or the detailed artistry that adorned it.
“Armor needs to be worn on the body. I trust that there’s no one who doesn’t want to make themselves appear a bit more handsome, so there’s a need for decorations like this,” Mu Qingping indifferently retorted.
Xia Fei calmly replied, “I don’t reject your words, but armor is armor. The first consideration should be protection, not aesthetics. The width of the shoulder has been widened by 0.7 centimeters, which will cause unnecessary obstruction when moving the arm. The breastplate has an odd shape, leaving 19% of the heart unprotected…”
Mu Qingping and Yu Hua were flabbergasted. No one could have imagined that Xia Fei would be able to find a whole host of problems in this seemingly magnificent suit of armor, and he spoke so clearly and logically that there was no way of arguing against him.
These details had been obscured by beauty, but this did not mean that they did not exist. Xia Fei’s sharp eyes had penetrated through the beauty and seen the essence. This sort of observation ability was simply astonishing!
Mu Qingping was unconvinced. For a weapon produced by the mighty Withered Mu to be criticized so thoroughly by a lowly Law Warrior was sheer humiliation!
“What about this one? This Silver Needle Torrent is a top Law Emperor battle armor, Unique Pavilion’s treasure!” Mu Qingping pointed at a half-suit of silver armor and said.
Yu Hua was startled. A top-class Law Emperor battle armor! In other words, this had the defensive power of a level 9 Great Law Emperor! It was the best of the best!
Xia Fei sighed. “The designer of this armor is probably a woman.”
Mu Qingping coldly glared at Xia Fei, clearly dissatisfied. “What does it matter if it’s a woman? Don’t look down on others!”
Xia Fei smiled. “I wasn’t looking down on anyone. On the contrary, from the meticulous design and excellent quality of the armor, I can see that a lot of thought and effort was put into it. Normally, male designers are much cruder and won’t focus so much on the details.”
Mu Qingping became a bit smug, finally feeling that Xia Fei had said something right.
However, before she had much time to bask in this pride, Xia Fei added another comment.
“It should have been a top-class suit of armor; alas, the designer forgot something very important. The waist was designed to be too slim, yet there’s no waist adjuster installed. How many people can actually wear this?”
The garden instantly fell silent. Everyone had somehow failed to notice such a fatal flaw.
This was like the difference between a fashion model and an ordinary person. Clothes on a fashion model were truly gorgeous, but not just anybody could go out wearing them. After all, how many people had the body of a fashion model?
No matter how good this set of armor looked or how great its quality was, nobody could deny that eighty percent of warriors would be unable to wear it, for it was far too demanding on the wearer’s body.
A suit of armor that the vast majority of people could not wear simply could not be described as a top-class suit of armor.
Xia Fei suddenly realized what he had done. He had been so focused that he had said something that he should not have. In fact, Mu Qingping’s face was already turning green!



Chapter-543-Silver-Desert
Chapter 543: Silver Desert 
Mu Qingping’s face turned green. It was clear that Xia Fei’s blunt words had inadvertently enraged her.
As the saying went, words from the loyal soothed, while the truth was unpleasant to hear. There was nothing wrong with speaking the truth. If there was any error here, it was that the listener was a woman from a noble and esteemed background, who had a taste far superior to the common crowd. Xia Fei had undoubtedly hurt Mu Qingping’s self-esteem.
Just as he was thinking of how to deal with the enraged Mu Qingping, Xia Fei suddenly spotted a very different suit of armor beneath a Chinese hemlock tree, which drew his attention.
Just when he was going to inspect it, Mu Qingping finally exploded.
“Hmph! What qualifies you to judge the worthiness of a suit of armor? Even if the demands on the body are harsh, there’s nothing wrong with that! If you can’t wear it, you can only blame your body for being too lacking, for being unworthy of possessing it!”
Women normally became unreasonable when they got angry, and Mu Qingping was no different.
Yu Hua hastily went up to soothe Mu Qingping’s rage, but at this moment, an indifferent voice drifted over from the distance.
“This Mister Xia Fei is right. Qingping, you must not be rude.”
Xia Fei and Yu Hua turned to the voice and saw a woman of about twenty years old slowly walking over, her face somewhat similar to Mu Qingping’s.
Though this woman did not use makeup, and her fair oval face contained a streak of indelible sorrow which could make one’s heart throb in pain. In this way, she was actually even more beautiful than Mu Qingping.
Xia Fei said nothing. His eyes were still looking over at that Chinese hemlock tree, not caring about the arrival of this woman.
“Older sister! This man is saying that the armor you designed is bad! He’s horrid!”
The woman smiled and stroked Mu Qingping’s hair.
“Gentleman, I am Mu Fuping, Mu Qingping’s older sister. I am wondering if I may speak with you.”
It was a gentle and calming voice that was impossible to refuse.
Yu Hua was just about to agree when Xia Fei suddenly strode over. As the Mu sisters and Yu Hua stared, he said, “If you have something to say, just say it here.”
Yu Hua helplessly shook his head. Xia Fei only had eyes for that silver suit of armor, not caring one bit about the Mu sisters.
With his businessman’s intuition, Yu Hua had realized something strange. Artificers had a lineage. The master would take a disciple, the disciple would take their disciple, and so on and so forth, passing down their techniques.
He had not heard of an artificer with a daughter. Mu Fuping was a young woman, but she was an artificer, and an artificer from the Mu family of the Nine Great Clans. The situation was definitely more complicated than it seemed.
If that peak Law Emperor battle armor Silver Needle Torrent really was made by Mu Fuping, then it was an even more incredible feat.
To create a peak Law Emperor armor, one at least had to be a peak Law Emperor. Mu Fuping was only twenty, yet she was already a peak Law Emperor?!
There was a flash of anger in Mu Qingping’s eyes, but just before she could erupt, Mu Fuping held her back.
“Unique Pavilion is treating an honored guest today. Close the shop and send off the other guests,” Mu Fuping softly ordered.
The maidservants and employees were all startled. Close the shop and send off the other guests? This was the first time this had happened since Unique Pavilion’s opening. Was it all because of these two from the Yu family?
Everyone withdrew with their orders, leaving behind the Mu sisters, Xia Fei, and Yu Hua in the Hundred Jade Garden.
Mu Qingping stomped her feet with a huff. She then turned around and left. Mu Fuping did not stop her, and after some thought, Yu Hua decided to go after Mu Qingping, leaving Xia Fei alone with Mu Fuping.
“Such a powerful killing intent! It’s no wonder it’s being displayed in a corner. This set of liquid war armor is very different from all the other weapons. Its bearing is something else entirely.” Phantom had also been entranced by this suit of armor.
This was a set of liquid war armor. Liquid metal could be soft or hard, and this suit of armor was currently in its hard state.
The sharp lines took the form of muscles, and the suit of armor appeared like a valiant warrior proudly standing beneath the tree.
It was as if this suit of armor had a life of its own. Xia Fei could almost hear the sound of a heart beating in its chest.
It provided defense from all sides, every part from the soles of the feet to the hairs tightly enclosed. Liquid war armor was a single object, and there was no need to link anything together, nor was there any sort of port or interface.
The red visor was like a pair of blood-red eyes, craving the blood of its enemies. That bloody color seemed to erupt from those two eyes.
There was no doubt that this suit of armor was special, standing out from the rest of the products of Unique Pavilion!
Xia Fei was bewitched by this suit of armor. The texture of the metal seemed to thrum with power. Even Warstar’s liquid war armor could not compare to it!
Xia Fei had discovered it among several hundred suits of armor, and it had seemingly discovered Xia Fei.
A warrior met eyes with a suit of armor. Xia Fei stared straight at the suit of armor as if they were two experts facing off.
‘This is the one!’ Xia Fei internally remarked.
Mu Fuping walked over and stood behind Xia Fei.
“This suit of liquid war armor is called ‘Silver Desert’. The defensive law energy attached to it is not powerful, only that from a level 6 Law Sovereign, but liquid war armor itself is extremely adaptive and tough, enough to make it one of the top-class suits of armor.”
Xia Fei nodded. He naturally understood the traits of liquid metal. This sort of armor that could move between flexible and tough was very comfortable and close-fitting. Moreover, liquid metal had a natural resistance to law energy and was even better when it came to protecting the human body.
“I will have someone take it down so that you can get a closer look. Come to the reception hall to see it.”
Xia Fei said nothing. Before leaving, he glanced at the price: 500 grade 4 Origin Crystals!
He almost broke out in a cold sweat. This was almost the limit of what Xia Fei could accept. However, if he bought Silver Desert, Xia Fei would not have the money to buy any other weapons. It appeared that he would have to keep waiting on the long-desired Spatial Compass.
“What you said earlier is very penetrating and incisive. I truly focus too much on the details when designing armor, ignoring the most fundamental requirements a warrior has when it comes to armor,” Mu Fuping said.
As the two of them spoke, they walked back to the reception hall. Mu Qingping was angrily sitting there, and when she saw Xia Fei come in, this girl turned her head away and coldly snorted. It was clear that her anger had yet to dissipate.
Xia Fei still had his mind on the Silver Desert armor, so he did not much care about her.
Mu Fuping continued to question Xia Fei on his thoughts of armor design, and Xia Fei did not mince words and said quite a lot.
Flexible combat uniforms were frequently used in the Alliance. These combat uniforms were very close-fitting, but they were lacking in defense. Law Realm warriors would have to face the powerful attacks of their foes, so they often used hard armors to raise their defense.
It was not hard to understand Xia Fei’s ideal. What he cared about was the level of comfort. A suit of armor must not disrupt one’s ability to attack. In Xia Fei’s view, armor was purely meant to defend, and offense was the greatest defense. He advocated for the view that offense was the way to gain victory.
Mu Fuping calmly listened, occasionally nodding her head. She seemed to be digesting Xia Fei’s words.
Xia Fei frowned and asked. “Miss Mu, you seem to have never experienced a real battle before, yes?”
Mu Fuping nodded, curiously asking, “How did you know?”
Xia Fei replied, “If you ever experienced that sensation of your life hanging by a thread, you wouldn’t care about whether or not a suit of armor is sufficiently beautiful and would remove those superfluous defensive layers. Combat armor exists to be used in combat. They’re tools meant to protect your life at crucial moments, not to show off on the battlefield.
“If you’re willing to listen to the requests of those experienced warriors or have each armor design tested to see if it makes sense or if it will interfere with one’s movements, all these problems would be easily resolved.”
Xia Fei spoke very practically, but his words could still cut at the woman’s self-esteem. Yu Hua quickly tried to cover for Xia Fei, changing the topic and asking, “Miss Mu, were you the one who applied law energy to all the suits of armor?”
Mu Fuping smiled. “My level is still not enough to reinforce the entire armor. I have only reinforced a small portion of the suit. For the majority, I mainly designed the armor, while the major artificers of the family did the application of law energy.”
Yu Hua was enlightened. It turned out that this woman was not a peak Law Emperor. He shrugged. After all, it was already a miracle to have become an artificer at such a young age. If she also had the cultivation of a peak Law Emperor, that would be truly heaven-defying!
Mu Qingping could no longer restrain herself, savagely saying, “You’re saying my sister’s products are bad! Is there something wrong with your eyes? Hmph! Do you know how many people want my sister to design their armor that she refused? Even if you want to buy something today, I refuse to sell anything to you!”
Xia Fei smiled. “My apologies. I’ve already ordered a suit of armor. I truly don’t want any of your older sister’s products.”
*Crash!*
Mu Qingping’s teacup fell to the floor while Yu Hua’s eyes bulged. Xia Fei’s stubbornness was truly something else. Not only did he not show any respect for Mu Qingping, he even dragged in Mu Fuping.
Mu Fuping’s face paled as she massaged her temples.
“You! You!” Mu Qingping was so angry to the point of speechlessness. Xia Fei had truly riled her up.
“Qingping, those people who asked me to design armor were all men after my hand. There’s no need to mention them again.” Mu Fuping displayed her excellent upbringing and calmly spoke. “Young Master Xia’s words are extremely reasonable. He has his reasons for not liking the armors I designed and they are understandable.”
Mu Qingping seemed to be obedient when it came to her sister, turning her head and saying more, suppressing her rage.
Xia Fei said, “Miss Fuping, I may have spoken rather harshly, but the truth is the truth. Please forgive me.”
At this moment, an employee came in with Silver Desert and placed it in front of Xia Fei.
Yu Hua was taken aback, apparently sensing the unique bearing of this suit of armor.
‘So this is the one he chose? Good eyes! It truly surpasses Mu Fuping’s products.’
Xia Fei immediately became excited upon seeing this suit of armor, praising it to the high heavens as he put it on.
The soft and pliant liquid metal covered his body like fur, light and tough. This sort of comfortable feeling was far superior to what cold hard armor could provide.
Even better, liquid metal was tough while also being very breathable. Even if one wore it night and day, one would not need to take it off. During the day, it could serve as tough combat armor, a weapon that could make one’s enemies shiver. At night, it could serve as a warm quilt. Even if one wore this combat armor on a cold night in an icy cave, one would still be able to sleep soundly without any problems.
“Great! This is the one!” Xia Fei excitedly said.
Mu Fuping ordered an employee to pack the armor. After some hesitation, she asked, “I happen to have some suits of armor that I’m in the middle of designing. I wonder if you can stay a few days and offer your opinions. Fuping will naturally compensate you for this.”
Yu Hua paled. The Mu sisters came from one of the Nine Great Clans. This was a wonderful opportunity to make connections. If they had the backing of the Withered Mu family…
Yu Hua’s mind worked quickly, but Xia Fei’s reply was even faster.
No one had expected Xia Fei to wave his hand and declare, “My apologies; I don’t have that much time.”
Yu Hua and Mu Qingping wanted nothing more than to rush up and give Xia Fei a good kick!
‘Do you know who you’re refusing?!’ Yu Hua and Mu Qingping mentally said in unison.



Chapter-544-A-Ball-aching-Problem
Chapter 544: A Ball-aching Problem 
Mu Qingping felt very angry while Mu Fuping felt very dejected. The reason was that Xia Fei had rejected her very obviously good intentions.
If Xia Fei had really assisted Mu Fuping in the design process, helping her progress farther on the path of the artificer, the Mu sisters would have undoubtedly owed him a big favor.
The Withered Mu Clan was one of the nine strongest clans in the circle. Having the two of them owe him a favor would be an extremely profitable exchange to Xia Fei. One day, he might require the help of the Mu family.
Mu Fuping’s fair face, which was as white as snow, turned even whiter. She was the sort who could easily make a man’s heart throb—inconspicuous, taciturn, and a face tinged with sorrow.
Before Mu Qingping could rage again, Xia Fei suddenly said, “It’s not that I don’t want to help you, but that I can’t.”
Mu Fuping frowned. “Why is that? The advice you gave moments ago is extremely useful, and Fuping understood a great deal from it.”
Xia Fei faintly smiled. “No matter how much I say, I can’t change how you conceptualize or your way of thinking, as you have no idea what it means to have your life hanging by a thread and what a mortal combat is. Thus, you can’t truly design with a warrior in mind.
“Your personality is too cultured and timid. I presume that this is the first time you’ve spoken so much?”
Mu Fuping said, “If I didn’t overhear you today, we might not even meet. Be it in the clan or in Unique Pavilion, it is true that I rarely speak with outsiders.”
Xia Fei said, “I don’t understand armor design, nor do I understand artificing, but I do understand the principle of superficiality. A designer is like an artist, and they must first break free of the restraints in their heart, forgetting about their gender or status and focusing entirely on designing. It is clear that you have too many considerations in your mind, caring a lot about aesthetics and what other people feel. Plus, you charge such a high price for your products which you presumably wish to sell to those scions or those who come purely because of the reputation of the Withered Mu Clan.
“These people, just like you, have their worries and considerations, so they will naturally be effusive with praise for your armor. As time passes, you will believe that beauty is correct. Birds of a feather flock together, and as you design armor for those important figures, you will naturally make a lot of money, but will any of those important figures actually go onto the battlefield and risk their lives? In the end, it’s still warriors like us who will spill our blood on the battlefield. What the rich need is not armor with high defenses, but dazzling decorations.
“With this isolated lifestyle of yours, you can only create art. You can’t design the weapons that grassroots warriors like me require.”
Mu Fuping was taken aback, and Mu Qingping had also fallen quiet, both earnestly considering Xia Fei’s words. In truth, the reasoning was very simple. The armor needed by scions was completely different from the weapons warriors like Xia Fei, who had grown up in a rain of bullets, needed. Xia Fei was a true warrior, so he naturally would not like those flashy and impractical things.
Warriors, who truly needed combat armor, would not come to Unique Pavilion, for the products were both very expensive and impractical. The customers who visited Unique Pavilion did not need armor, for they had warriors who would fight for them. Little by little, the luxurious Unique Pavilion would become a toystore for the wealthy of the circle, nothing more than a display case.
Mu Fuping gathered her courage and said, “Young Master Xia, I wish to design armor that true warriors can use, a weapon for killing enemies. Please help me.”
Yu Hua’s wrist trembled. Mu Fuping was speaking with such solemnity that it was obvious she was sincere.
It was hard to blame her. A young miss who had resided for a long time in a mansion was interacting with another circle, and hearing a few words from someone from the grassroots like Xia Fei would leave her stunned. This was because she had never met people like this before. Xia Fei’s words all sounded new and different to her, each sentence containing a profound meaning.
They lived in the same universe, but they were people from two different worlds.
Xia Fei smiled, a hint of mischief surfaced in his mind.
“Initially, as the two of you are women, there are some things that I left unsaid. In truth, Miss Fuping’s designs have a very silly flaw.”
“What flaw?” Mu Fuping nervously asked; Mu Qingping also perked up her ears.
“Men and women aren’t the same biologically,” Xia Fei said, pointing between his legs. The Mu sisters immediately flushed red, their scalps going numb.
“In this place, men bulge out a little, but Miss Mu designed the area around the crotch very tightly. If a man wears armor like that, then…”
“Then what?”
“Their balls will hurt…”
The room fell silent. The Mu sisters’ faces rapidly turned red, then purple, a bead of sweat occasionally trickling down their foreheads.
It truly was a silly flaw. The thought of those scions, who had bought Mu Fuping’s armor, as they endured the pain in their balls and proudly stood made Yu Hua almost break out in laughter on the spot.
Xia Fei did not seem to care. In his view, this was a very serious problem. No one would wear a suit of armor which could hurt their testicles to fight. A momentary lack of caution might result in their bloodline coming to an end, and the pressure was so great that a warrior would never be able to fight in peace while wearing this sort of armor.
“So what I’m saying is that Miss Fuping may have to start your learning all the way from basic biology. Not only do you have to make the crotch bulge a little, you should add in a layer of soft protection, too. After all, that place is very fragile. Moreover, men will have them in different sizes and shapes…”
Xia Fei spoke very seriously, but the two women could not keep listening. Telling such things to these women who had yet to familiarize themselves with the ways of the world? Mu Fuping and Mu Qingping were so embarrassed that they wanted to find a hole they could hide themselves in.
“No more! The Mu sisters spoke as one, interrupting Xia Fei’s biology class.
…
Xia Fei and Yu Hua said their goodbyes and made their way back to the Yu family. They had been gone for ten-some days, and it was about time that they reported to Patriarch Yu Jiang.
Mu Fuping watched Xia Fei leave; after which, she softly said, “It’s not hard to understand what Xia Fei said. Why is it that no one in the clan ever told me this?”
Mu Qingping pouted. “Who in the family would dare say what he said? He’s a savage with no shame. He’s capable of speaking any sort of nonsense.”
Mu Fuping lightly nodded. The people in their family were too worried about status to point out these flaws, but Xia Fei did not have such considerations. Thus, he had bluntly pointed out all the flaws in Mu Fuping’s designs. If not for him, she would have continued designing her armors without regard for the outside world.
“Pack up our things and prepare some gifts. In two days, I will pay a personal visit to the Yu family,” Mu Fuping ordered as she got up to return to her room.
Mu Qingping curiously asked, “Older sister, why are you going to the Yu family?”
“Looking at how warriors truly live might help me when designing my armor.”
Mu Qingping said, “There’s no need to go to the Yu family for that. Ours has many warriors as well.”
“Will they tell the truth? Will they be like Xia Fei and fearlessly slander my products?”
Mu Qingping stomped her feet. “What is this?! Are you addicted to being insulted?!”
“I just want to hear some honest opinions,” Mu Fuping casually said before drifting away.
…
After reporting the killing of Dark Ghost’s group to Yu Jiang, Xia Fei returned to his calm and peaceful life. In the mornings, he would take a stroll around the city, listen to the lessons he wanted to hear, and then walk around Roaring Tiger Park. Xia Fei would allocate the rest of the time as he wished.
The Yu family taught its Law Warriors mainly through public lessons. Every day, a platform would be set up in the city; upon which, an experienced instructor would lecture on law energy and fighting techniques. The warriors could choose which one’s they wanted to listen to, and if they had any questions, they could go and ask the instructors in the morning when more than a dozen of them were present. The learning environment was very open, and it was mostly left up to the warriors to study and cultivate.
On one side of a field that broadcasted today’s public lesson, Xia Fei looked for a while before he found it uninteresting and headed back to his residence, not even visiting Roaring Tiger Park.
Roaring Tiger Park only had two exotic beasts left, and he only helped others tame their beasts once every ten days. Thus, things were fine even if Xia Fei did not go. It was essentially a job with no obligations.
In the cultivation chamber, Xia Fei took out that white jade ape. Each time he held it, he felt refreshed and a hundred times more focused. Whether he studied or cultivated, he would always be more efficient.
His primary objective was to study the Law of Energy Purification. Money was spent far too quickly in the Law Realm, and energy master was a profession that could produce its own money. Producing energy had always been Xia Fei’s dream. Breaking free of the restriction of Origin Crystals and becoming an energy master was the only path!
Alas, the clan had only one energy master, Duba, and Xia Fei had no means of acquiring his instruction. The two got along like fire and water, as Gu Tong’s demotion had been a very sharp sting to Xia Fei. Xia Fei found that he could not ask for instruction from someone he disliked.
Originally, Xia Fei thought that this ape alone could help him learn the Law of Energy Purification, but after some testing, he realized that focus was far from enough. Those threads in his brain region remained difficult to control, and his cultivation progress remained stagnant.
Placing the white jade ape on the ground, Xia Fei lit a cigarette and began wondering if this weird object had another use besides focusing the mind.
Furball lazily reclined on the side, doing all sorts of adorable things to make Xia Fei happy. Ever since his food was upgraded to grade 3 Origin Crystals, this fellow had truly become content with his simple life. Although his body did not seem to be growing any longer, his fur was growing denser and glossier. Xia Fei was sure that the day that Furball rose to the next rank was getting closer and closer. The prerequisite was that Furball had to be given enough food every day.
A pair of small eyes stared at the white jade ape. Furball was clearly very curious about this possession of Xia Fei’s. He liked it a lot and would often hug it.
While this ape was weird, it did not contain any energy, so Xia Fei was not worried about Furball eating it. Furball was the classic case of treating whoever provided his milk as his mother. Xia Fei fed him a grade 3 Origin Crystal every day, so he was very obedient.
Furball kissed the white jade ape with his mouth and nuzzled his head against it.
Suddenly, Furball burped, and a white wisp of energy drifted out from his stomach.
This sort of thing had only begun to happen recently. A grade 3 Origin Crystal had one hundred times the energy of a grade 2! Every day, after eating only one, Furball would feel very full and would constantly burp.
Strangely, the energy that Furball burped out became an extremely thin line after it passed through the white jade ape’s body!
“Eh?”
Phantom and Xia Fei immediately noticed this obvious change, and confusion appeared in their eyes.
“No way? This white jade ape can also concentrate energy?” Phantom murmured in shock



Chapter-545-A-False-Alarm
Chapter 545: A False Alarm 
The discovery regarding the white jade ape was very wondrous, and Xia Fei was forced to inspect this exquisitely crafted ape again.
The white ape had been crafted to be sitting cross-legged. On one hand, it was raising a peach. Its expression was like that of a monk in meditation, a hint of a smile on its face.
“When energy passes through this ape, it becomes concentrated. What’s the reason for that?” Phantom asked in confusion.
Xia Fei shook his head. He also did not understand this very much. However, he had suddenly realized that this ape could be used as a pedestal.
He took out a grade 3 Origin Crystal from his spatial ring and lightly placed it on the ape. As expected, the crystal could snugly fit in the bosom of the ape!
The crystals used by the Law Realm were identical in size. While the white jade ape was seated cross-legged, there was a space between its legs which was perfect for an Origin Crystal!
Even more surprising was that the white jade ape was slowly absorbing the energy, and that peach it held high overhead began glowing like a lightbulb!
Holding his breath, Xia Fei lightly placed his finger on it.
*Whoosh~*
A very thin and pure thread of energy swiftly entered his seventh brain region like an agile snake!
This unprecedented sensation left Xia Fei both surprised and delighted. Once concentrated, the energy was incredibly pure, but there was still a bit of intensity to it. It seemed like this was the essence of Origin Energy, that true most effective part!
Xia Fei immediately tried to cultivate the Law of Energy Purification in his seventh brain region!
Those threads of energy, which had originally been difficult to control, were now much more obedient. Before this, they ran around, doing whatever they pleased, no matter what Xia Fei thought, but now, this sort of behavior was much less frequent.
It still was not easy to control them, for they would often overcompensate. When Xia Fei had it go left, it would immediately travel a long distance. The direction was right, but the strength was too much.
At this time, Xia Fei’s superb energy control went to work. He constantly adjusted his control over the thread, slowly making subtle adjustments.
The pattern began to form, the threads growing more and more concentrated. This could be considered a rather tough test of Xia Fei’s energy control.
Suddenly, when the pattern was nearly half complete, the Origin Crystal in the white jade ape’s bosom dimmed and lost its luster.
“Ten minutes! A grade 3 Origin Crystal can only last ten minutes!” Phantom exclaimed. “The white jade ape is seemingly able to alter the nature of energy, causing your consumption of energy during cultivation to increase massively!”
Xia Fei frowned. A grade 3 crystal was normally enough to sustain his cultivation for an hour, but the time had been reduced to a sixth of that! This was truly a pricey endeavor!
Nonetheless, he was making progress in the Law of Energy Purification. This sort of pleasant surprise was enough to balance out the expensive cost. As long as he could become an energy master, money and energy would cease to be problems! All the costs would be worth it.
Gritting his teeth, Xia Fei removed a yellow grade 4 Origin Crystal from his ring. Xia Fei had many grade 3 crystals, but only one hundred grade 4s. He had used most of them in purchasing the liquid war armor, Silver Sand.
Once the grade 4 crystal was placed in the white jade ape’s bosom, the peach above its head began glowing with an even brighter luster. Xia Fei readied himself to cultivate the Law of Energy Purification again.
*Thump thump thump!*
Knocking came from outside. “Master, there’s a guest here to see you,” Pod said.
“Who could it be?” Xia Fei put away the white jade ape and left the cultivation chamber for the living room.
He saw Mu Fuping and Yu Hua sitting next to each other. The meticulous Pod had already served tea and snacks to the pair, which they were in the middle of enjoying.
Xia Fei smiled. “Miss Mu, why are you here?”
Mu Fuping said, “When you were at Unique Pavilion, you said that I need to observe on-site how warriors actually live and what they require, so I asked Senior Yu Hua to take me around the Yu family.”
Xia Fei’s mind was completely occupied by the problem of the Law of Energy Purification, so he was not paying much attention to Yu Hua and Mu Fuping. He asked back, “The Withered Mu family has even more warriors. Why come to here to observe?”
Yu Hua almost spat out his tea as he shot Xia Fei a strange look. Xia Fei seemed to have some sort of grudge against Mu Fuping, always speaking to her with a scolding tone. This was a young lady of one of the Nine Great Clans. When mocking others, one had to understand who they were mocking!
Not only did Mu Fuping not blame Xia Fei in the least, she seemed to admire Xia Fei even more. Even the ears of a statue would start getting calluses after hearing twenty years of praise. Thus, Mu Fuping preferred it when people were more straightforward with her.
“The people in my family will always be apprehensive when speaking with me, so it will be very difficult for me to know of their true experiences,” Mu Fuping explained.
Xia Fei replied, “Oh, that’s simple. If you change your face and disguise yourself, you’ll naturally be able to go unrecognized. When you go walking among a different family, you’ll be able to hear their true feelings easily.”
*Pa!*
A noise came from the roof!
“Someone’s eavesdropping!” Yu Hua said in shock.
*Whoosh~*
Xia Fei and Yu Hua charged out. One was a speed ability user while the other was a Great Law Emperor. They moved very quickly; alas, the person on the roof was even faster!
In the time it took to blink, that person was gone without a trace!
*Whoosh!*
Xia Fei jumped onto the roof and scanned the tiles. The roof was covered in dust, and the person who had been lying on top of it and listening had naturally left an impression.
“One person 1.7 meters tall, with a thin figure.”
Placing his fingers on the tiles, Xia Fei added, “Warm. Presumably, they came with you and Mu Fuping and have been hiding up here for some time.”
Yu Hua was furious. For a Great Law Emperor to have been followed without realizing it was an immense humiliation!
“You stay behind and protect Miss Mu. I’ll go and search for him!” Yu Hua loudly said. After which, he completely vanished.
Xia Fei swiftly jumped down the roof and headed back into the room. Placing Furball on his thigh, he began to think.
The Withered Mu family was one of humanity’s nine strongest law clans. If a member of them died in the Yu family, in his house, he would undoubtedly be implicated!
This was a vicious move! If someone was intent on framing the Yu family, there truly was not much one could do about it.
“Does Miss Fuping have an enemy?” Xia Fei sternly asked.
Mu Fuping somewhat hesitantly said, “I have not had an enemy before.”
“Then could it be an enemy of the Withered Mu family taking their anger out on you?”
After some thought, Mu Fuping said, “My family is enormous. What clan wouldn’t have an enemy?”
Xia Fei said nothing, taking up a tea cup and sipping on it.
Mu Fuping suddenly thought of something, but after hesitating for some time, she decided not to say anything.
A few moments later, Yu Hua returned. Xia Fei glanced at Yu Hua’s expression and knew that the mysterious eavesdropper had escaped. Someone who could escape from Great Law Emperor Yu Hua? That person must possess a very high cultivation.
Raising his tea cup, Xia Fei said, “Miss Fuping, I have important business to attend to, so I won’t keep you.”
Raising the tea cup and sending off the guest?
Such decisiveness!
Mu Fuping felt dizzy. What had she done to offend Xia Fei to be treated like this?
Xia Fei furtively exchanged a glance with Yu Hua, and Yu Hua gave a slight nod.
The two of them were not like Mu Fuping, who had grown up in the middle of a mansion and did not understand the wickedness of human nature.
What Mu Fuping viewed as an insignificant incident had triggered the vigilance of Yu Hua and Xia Fei, and Yu Hua did not blame Xia Fei for sending his guest away. He was keenly aware that nothing could happen to Mu Fuping while she was in the Yu family. The Yus could not take the wrath of one of the Nine Great Clans!
“Miss Mu, I will send you back. We can observe the warriors cultivating later,” Yu Hua firmly said.
Mu Fuping was truly vexed. To her surprise, even Yu Hua, who had always treated her with respect, was asking her to leave!
“Alright. I’ll take my leave, then!” Mu Fuping coldly said, not even saying goodbye to Xia Fei before barging out the door.
Yu Hua said, “You follow her. I’ll remain in proximity and keep watch.”
Xia Fei firmly nodded. After working together once already, the two shared some level of tacit understanding.
At a time like this, no one would care about the anger of the Young Lady Mu. Her rage was nothing compared to the annihilation of the Yu family!
Even the slick and unscrupulous Yu Hua had not shown the slightest hesitation. It was clear that, while Xia Fei’s methods were callous and cold, they were the most appropriate. Nothing regarding the Nine Great Clans was a minor affair!
Xia Fei went after Mu Fuping, placing Furball on his shoulder as he looked warily around.
Mu Fuping truly had been rather angry at the start. Every girl had some temper, and anyone would have found it hard to accept being driven out of someone’s home so abruptly.
However, Xia Fei’s wary eyes made her realize that something was off. After that noise came from the roof, Yu Hua and Xia Fei had become different people, their expressions grim.
At this moment, Xia Fei happened to run into Yu Qiqi.
Yu Qiqi stood at the intersection, a mischievous look on her face. “Oh, which family is this girl you’ve seduced from? She looks rather pretty.”
Yu Qiqi was a heartless sort, and she was an expert at messing around with other people. If Mu Fuping was really Xia Fei’s girlfriend, she would certainly immediately go red at the ears from these words, which was exactly what Yu Qiqi was after.
Alas, before Yu Qiqi could see Mu Fuping blush, she was greeted by an angry roar.
“Scram!” Xia Fei bellowed, and Yu Qiqi’s face froze. Before she could react, Xia Fei and Mu Fuping had already walked past her.
Yu Qiqi’s mistake was her timing this time around. Normally, Xia Fei would have definitely retorted, throwing back an appropriate response to whatever he received. Unfortunately, Xia Fei had no intention of joking around with Little Miss Qi. His one ‘scram’ had left Yu Qiqi stunned.
‘It seems like Xia Fei isn’t very patient when it comes to women. It seems that he was already being very polite with me.’ Those who spoke had no idea of what those who listened were thinking. Mu Fuping had mistakenly believed that this was Xia Fei’s real personality, thus creating a misunderstanding that was neither too large nor too small.
At the Spatial Gate, Yu Hua and Xia Fei sent Mu Fuping back to Foundry City, both appearing rather nervous.
Only after they watched Mu Fuping enter Unique Pavilion did Yu Hua and Xia Fei finally sigh in relief.
“That was close. It seems that someone is watching Miss Mu, though I don’t know if it’s an enemy,” Yu Hua said.
Xia Fei nodded. “It’s a good thing nothing bad happened at my house. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be able to clear our names even if we jumped into the Yellow River.”
Yu Hua smiled. “You know, don’t you think we understand each other rather well?”
Xia Fei replied, “Anyone would immediately think about sending Miss Mu home. If something bad happened, the implications would be severe.”
“However, Mu Fuping is certain to think that we don’t respect her thusly, and she may not return to the Yu family anymore.” Yu Hua sighed.
Xia Fei smiled. “Would you like her to visit the Yu family more often?”
“No. At least not right now.”
As the two were conversing, they returned to the Yu family through the Spatial Gate. They were greeted by a furious Yu Qiqi, who was about to explode in vitriol against Xia Fei. However, upon seeing Yu Hua, Yu Qiqi changed her mind, putting on a pitiful appearance and saying, “Uncle Hua, Xia Fei was bullying me!”
Yu Hua indifferently said, “I saw it all.”
Yu Qiqi was delighted. “Then how do you plan to punish him? He scolded your obedient little niece!”
“Serves you right!” Yu Hua barked these three words before walking off with Xia Fei, leaving behind a once-more stupefied Yu Qiqi.



Chapter-546-Luring-the-Tiger-Away-from-the-Mountain
Chapter 546: Luring the Tiger Away from the Mountain 
Mu Qingping sat in the reception hall. Across from her was a man in his fifties, a scowl on his face.
“Uncle Yuan, how could you be so careless as to be discovered by the people of the Yu family?” Mu Qingping asked with a frown.
Mu Yuan sighed. “The young miss just arrived at the Yu family when that Xia Fei began speaking rudely to her, putting the squeeze on Miss Fuping. While I was listening on the roof, I felt like my lungs were about to explode from rage! In just a few words, he recommended that Miss Fuping change her face, disguise herself as an ordinary person, and observe the people of another clan!
“The master was already very antsy when he allowed Miss Fuping to set up Unique Pavilion in Foundry City. If the young miss started disguising herself and running around, what would happen then? I was so frantic that I inadvertently revealed myself, causing Yu Hua and Xia Fei to discover me.”
Mu Qingping instantly jumped out of her chair in anger. “That Xia Fei! My sister is so precious, yet he dared to incite her to disguise herself and tour around! I’m going to explode!”
Mu Yuan added fuel to the fire, saying, “If the young miss really listened to Xia Fei and disguised herself to go out and explore about, that would be terrible! It would all be because of Xia Fei’s incitements!”
Mu Qingping impatiently waved her hand. “I don’t blame you for this incident. You’re dismissed for now.”
Xia Fei and Yu Hua had no idea that the so-called assassin was really someone from the Mu family. This man had followed Mu Fuping, causing the two of them to panic and to offend Mu Fuping. Of course, there was also the lamentable Yu Qiqi.
It was not long before Xia Fei and Yu Hua had escorted Mu Fuping back to Unique Pavilion.
Mu Qingping saw that her older sister had returned and hastily put on a smile and went to welcome her.
“Sister, why did you come back so soon?”
Mu Fuping looked at her younger sister very seriously. “Tell me the truth: Did you send someone to follow me in secret?”
Mu Qingping feigned shock and alarm. “Sister, you were followed? Could it be an enemy of our family?”
“It really wasn’t you?”
“How could I send someone to follow Older Sister? Just listen to yourself.”
Mu Fuping nodded, taking her at her word.
In truth, neither Yu Hua nor Xia Fei understood Mu Fuping’s secrets. All they knew was that she was a young miss of the Withered Mu Clan, who could bring out a lot of money to set up Unique Pavilion, so she probably had a rather high status in the clan. Yu Hua had even considered her as someone he could form a connection with and treated her with utmost respect.
The two of them did not understand Mu Fuping’s personality. Xia Fei thought that she was scholarly and timid, lacking experience in the ways of the world. She was modest and never snobbish, making her one of the better young misses from wealthy families.
However, Xia Fei had no idea that Mu Fuping had the stubbornness and obstinance of the Withered Mu Clan in her genes.
The Withered Mu Clan originally had the surname Mu. The reason the circle called this clan Withered Mu was not merely because of their original surname but also to describe their stubborn and inflexible personality. Withered mu (wood) could not be carved, and to the people of the Law Realm, those of the Mu family would push through a wall to get their way.
The more Mu Fuping thought about it, the stranger it seemed. Xia Fei and Yu Hua had so nervously sent her back not because they were disrespecting her but because they feared some mishap. However, she had yet to observe how warriors lived, and it was a matter which would continue to vex her.
…
After a night of cultivation, the white jade ape had consumed an entire precious grade 4 Origin Crystal. Xia Fei had made even more progress in the Law of Energy Purification and was on the brink of breaking through the threshold.
Just when Xia Fei was ready to make another attempt at a breakthrough, Yu Hua paid an unexpected visit.
“Hurry up and put down whatever you’re doing and come with me,” Yu Hua said upon seeing Xia Fei.
“What’s wrong? I’m in the middle of cultivation.”
Yu Hua sighed. “Miss Mu Fuping is back again.”
“Again?!”
“It’s all your fault for suggesting that she go incognito. This time, Mu Fuping changed her appearance and came to the Yu family. She’s observing the warriors train in the city right now.”
Xia Fei felt helpless. He had not expected Mu Fuping to have such a stubborn personality. Even though he had unreasonably sent her home yesterday, he failed to dispel her resolve to observe the daily routine of Law Warriors.
“I really can’t leave right now,” Xia Fei said. He was on the cusp of attaining a law, and he had no desire to split his focus at this time.
Yu Hua rolled his eyes. “You’re the one who caused all this. If not for you, Mu Fuping wouldn’t keep coming back. Let’s follow the same rules as last time. You stay by her side while I keep watch of the surroundings.
“This is no trifling matter. If something happens to Mu Fuping in the Yu family, both of us will be eating the consequences. It’s best if we keep this matter to ourselves unless absolutely necessary.”
Xia Fei sighed. Scooping up Furball, he followed Yu Hua to the dirt field where the warriors were training.
From a distance, he spotted Mu Fuping standing at the perimeter and watching. She was wearing men’s clothes today, blue leisure clothes. She looked like a pretty boy and was receiving quite a few looks from other girls.
Xia Fei frowned and walked over. Standing at Mu Fuping’s side, he appeared like a bodyguard.
“I understand now,” Mu Fuping softly said. “The reason you sent me back without a word yesterday is you’re worried that something might happen to me. You had good intentions.”
Xia Fei said nothing. He knew that he was in a hurry to send Mu Fuping away not out of kind intentions. Rather, if she had died in the Yu family, the blame would have fallen on him. Mu Fuping was so simple-minded that Xia Fei did not know whether he should laugh or cry.
“Do you really want to know how warriors train and live?” Xia Fei asked.
Mu Fuping firmly nodded. Without another word, Xia Fei took Mu Fuping to a human-shaped target and took out a dagger from his spatial ring: October Flying Snow.
Thrust!
Thrust again!
For the rest of the morning, Xia Fei constantly repeated this action. The essence of the Sly Thrust was in this single thrust. As he had recently been studying law powers, Xia Fei had not practiced the Crafty Approach. Since Miss Mu wanted to watch today, Xia Fei might as well give her a show!
Mu Fuping’s eyes grew more and more astonished. Xia Fei’s movements were very fast. For four whole hours, he repeated this one movement. This sort of harsh training left her in disbelief. She could not even keep count of the number of times Xia Fei had thrust his dagger.
Putting away October Flying Snow, Xia Fei wiped off his sweat and walked up to Mu Fuping’s side. He softly said, “I’m going to eat and rest for thirty minutes.”
The food at the Yu family was rather decent, but to this lady who had been raised like a princess, she could not stomach it. She barely managed to eat a few fruits, but Xia Fei wolfed twenty-four bowls of food.
For the entire afternoon, Xia Fei practiced the footwork for Crafty Approach. Like a gust of wind, he constantly changed directions and turned over and over.
By the time the sun was setting, all of Mu Fuping’s curiosity had been replaced by shock.
“This is one day of your training?”
Xia Fei shook his head. “It’s been a long time since I trained my body, so I did a little review. At night, I still have to cultivate law powers and martial techniques. I go to sleep at 3 AM and get up at 5 AM to cultivate my special abilities.”
Mu Fuping’s body froze. Such cruel and spartan training was simply unimaginable!
“I understand. Warriors are so harsh on themselves that they can’t be sloppy when it comes to their armor. Even a tiny flaw will cause them a lot of trouble. After all, every movement has to be repeated tens of thousands of times.
Xia Fei nodded. “Miss Mu, it’s good as long as you understand. My ideals don’t forbid decorations, but decorations can’t impair the function.
“It’s late now. I’ll send you back to Unique Pavilion.”
As he spoke, seven dazzling colors appeared over the horizon, even more resplendent than the artificial sunset!
“Seven Dragons Split the Heavens!” Xia Fei exclaimed in shock. “Not good! This is Yu Hua’s ultimate technique! He’s fighting with someone else! It might be the person who was following you yesterday!”
At the same time, a giant purple net descended from the heavens, capturing Yu Hua’s seven spatial fissures. The two sides were fighting!
“Violet Wood Lightning Array! This is a special technique of our Mu family. Yu Hua might be fighting with a warrior of our Withered Mu Clan.”
Mu Fuping found it very strange. Why had someone from the Mu family come over to the Yu family and started fighting with Yu Hua?
The battle in the distance was very obvious, and large numbers of Yu family warriors rushed over. Xia Fei grabbed Mu Fuping and quickly led her to the Spatial Gate.
Regardless of the reason Yu Hua started fighting with that Mu Family’s Law Adept, Mu Fuping’s safety was paramount. Xia Fei was keenly aware of this point.
“Let’s leave this place.”
“No, I need to see which person of our clan came to the Yu family and if they were following me,” Mu Fuping shook off Xia Fei’s hand and stubbornly said.
Xia Fei allowed no explanation, nor did he cared about the difference between men and women this time. He carried Mu Fuping’s body and rushed for the Spatial Gate. Yu Hua was smart enough to deal with the situation, so there was no need to worry about things on his end.
Xia Fei’s keen senses were making him extremely uneasy, but he could not pinpoint exactly what was strange. However, the sensation left him very uncomfortable.
Suddenly, when he was five hundred meters from the Spatial Gate, Xia Fei stopped. The Spatial Gate was an important location of the Yu family and heavily guarded, but at this moment, there was not a single person around. This was very strange! Very unusual!
“Miss Fuping, we meet again,” an elderly voice suddenly spoke. A short and thin elder suddenly appeared behind Xia Fei, blocking them from going back.
“Seventh Grandpa, it’s you!” Mu Fuping exclaimed.
The elder had a healthy complexion, and if not for his white hair, one would mistake him for a child.
Xia Fei could sense fear in Mu Fuping’s voice. It seemed like this was an unwelcome visitor from her clan!
…
“Stay your hand! I am an Ironguard of the Mu family, Mu Yuan!”
Yu Hua froze in shock. The Ironguards were an elite division of the Mu family which served as trusted security. He could already see from the move Mu Yuan had used that this man was from the Mu family, but he remained cautious.
Many of the Yu family’s warriors were coming over. Yu Hua and Mu Yuan’s battle had drawn everyone’s attention.
“I was chasing someone, but when I got close and used my attack, it turned out to be you!” Mu Yuan said in frustration.
Yu Hua was incredibly sharp, and upon hearing these words, he instantly paled!
“I was also chasing someone, a short and thin elder, to the foot of the mountain, but it turned out to be you!”
The two of them were flabbergasted. Mu Yuan asked, “White hair, 1.4 meters tall?”
“Precisely!”
Mu Yuan turned ghastly pale. “Oh, no! That’s Mu Qiubo, the scum of our Withered Clan! Three months ago, he was banished from the Mu family by the young miss’s father! The young miss! Where is the young miss?!”



Chapter-547-The-Tampered-Spatial-Gate
Chapter 547: The Tampered Spatial Gate 
Xia Fei’s mind rapidly turned. From the look on Mu Fuping’s face, though she called this short and thin elder Seventh Grandpa, this was no kind fellow. This was because Mu Fuping was slightly trembling and her eyes were stricken with fear.
According to what they had agreed on before, Yu Hua should have been in the vicinity so that he could charge out at the sign of any mishap.
Alas, Yu Hua was fighting someone else on the horizon and would not be able to come over any time soon. It was at this exact moment that this elder chose to abruptly appear. Xia Fei instantly understood that this was a scheme to lure the tiger away from the mountain!
“Girl, your seventh grandpa needs you for something. Be a good girl and come with me,” Mu Qiubo smiled and said.
He turned over and glanced into the distance. Mu Qiubo did not have much time. On that end were two Great Law Emperors, Yu Hua and Mu Yuan. The moment they understood that this was a plan to lure the tiger away from the mountain, Mu Qiubo would be in a dire predicament. Thus, he had to act quickly!
“Seal!”
A spatial barrier suddenly appeared around Xia Fei, enclosing him and Mu Fuping. A wave of light appeared in Mu Qiubo’s hand. He was preparing to use law force to take Mu Fuping away with him.
“Break!”
Two arms extended, two fists infused with the subversive force of the Law of Primal Chaos slamming into the barrier.
*Rumble!*
The spatial barrier shattered!
Mu Qiubo gasped in alarm. He had never imagined that Xia Fei would be able to break his spatial barrier.
Xia Fei shoved Mu Fuping by her waist, pushing her some several dozen meters away. Xia Fei also borrowed the inertia to fly into the air and sent out a heavy punch!
“Use the Spatial Gate and get out of here!” Xia Fei sternly said.
Mu Fuping was not a complete weakling, and her cultivation was that of a Law Sovereign. Xia Fei pushing her away like this would not do her any harm. On the contrary, it placed her closer to the Spatial Gate.
Fifteen seconds! Xia Fei was confident that he could hold down Mu Qiubo for fifteen seconds, giving Mu Fuping a chance to escape. If he could hold on for thirty seconds, then Yu Hua would definitely be able to get back and assist him!
He moved with incredible speed, and in the blink of an eye, his Wildstorm Fist was above Mu Qiubo, making straight for his head!
“Out of my way!” Mu Qiubo roared in fury, his arms thrusting out. The two waves of light intersected like curved blades and howled through the air!
“Crafty Approach!”
Someone, who could lure Yu Hua away, would surely have a substantial cultivation, and Xia Fei had no intention of fighting it out with this man. This punch had always been a feint!
As his body made a curved arc in the air, Xia Fei moved around to Mu Qiubo’s left side like an agile mudfish.
*Rumble!*
Four tornadoes swept out! It was as if Xia Fei had tossed out an explosion which was now tearing apart space.
“Useless!”
Mu Qiubo swung his left arm, aiming his palm at the spatial fissure that Xia Fei had unleashed.
Light erupted from his palm, like the beam fired by a laser!
*Bang!*
The spatial tears were torn to shreds! This was a tear technique against a tear technique, and Mu Qiubo’s attack was far stronger than Xia Fei had imagined!
This light tore through the fissure and shot straight at Xia Fei!
“Liquid War armor!”
Mercury-like liquid crawled up Xia Fei’s body and enclosed him.
*Rumble!*
The laser beam did not stop, blasting Xia Fei into the air. Because of the Liquid War armor, Xia Fei appeared like a ball of silver metal flying through the air.
“Hmph! Know your own limitations!”
Mu Qiubo squatted. No longer caring about Xia Fei as he flew off, he focused his attention back on Mu Fuping and prepared to seize her in one fell swoop!
While Mu Fuping had the cultivation, she had no experience fighting an enemy. Although she had Law Sovereign cultivation, in a real fight, she would be no match for Xia Fei, let alone the shrewd and ruthless Mu Qiubo.
Pew pew pew!
Just when Mu Qiubo’s arm was about to reach Mu Fuping’s back, Xia Fei began launching long-distance attacks, balls of light howling through the air, coming in at an angle to block Mu Qiubo’s path!
Of course, these were not Xia Fei’s attacks, but Furball’s!
It was impossible for Xia Fei to launch an attack in the short span of time available to him, but Furball could! He had been hiding in Xia Fei’s bosom this entire time, and when Xia Fei saw that Mu Fuping was about to be captured, he immediately ordered Furball to fire a salvo of energy balls to force Mu Qiubo back.
The moment his feet touched the ground, Xia Fei started running, accelerating toward Mu Fuping. He grabbed her with his left hand and threw her into the Spatial Gate!
This was an astonishing move. No one would throw a girl like a basketball, but Xia Fei had no time to worry about any risks. In any case, Mu Fuping cultivated law powers, so throwing her would not kill her.
*Ping!*
With a flick of his fingers, Xia Fei furtively shot out a small stone.
On the side of the Gate were several round gauges like clocks. These were used to set coordinates, with the Spatial Gate transporting the person to the coordinates indicated.
Mu Fuping was in front, with Xia Fei chasing right after Mu Fuping and Mu Qiubo right on Xia Fei’s tail, the three formed a straight line.
As Mu Fuping was tossed into the Spatial Gate, the stone struck one of the round gauges.
The gauge rapidly spanned. Where would it eventually stop?
“Crafty Approach!”
Just as he was about to run into the Spatial Gate, Xia Fei suddenly rose into the air. He wanted to vault over the gate!
This was an extremely creative move. Xia Fei first threw Mu Fuping inside the Spatial Gate, and then he messed with the coordinates; after which, he would use Crafty Approach to get around the gate. Meanwhile, Mu Qiubo, who was following right behind him, would end up running right into the Spatial Gate.
It was the same Spatial Gate, but Mu Qiubo would discover that he was ending up in a completely different place from Mu Fuping. By the time he realized what was going on, the Spatial Gate might have sent him straight into a black hole, utterly destroying him!
A crafty smile appeared on Xia Fei’s lips. Xia Fei was very smug. Mu Qiubo could keep up his chase, and only the gods knew where he would end up.
Suddenly, a steely hand gripped Xia Fei’s ankle, pulling him into the Spatial Gate!
Xia Fei’s face was stricken with fear. These were random coordinates! No one could say where one would end up being teleported!
Only now did he understand what it meant to say that no plan could keep up quickly enough to an adaptive situation.
He had thrown Mu Fuping into the Spatial Gate and then messed up the coordinates so that his foe would end up somewhere completely different.
Xia Fei had exercised his imagination to its utmost to develop this tactic!
It must be understood that all of this had taken place in the span of a few seconds. Even a bystander would not have had time to think it over, let alone develop and execute such a crafty plan.
Xia Fei had thought about it, done it, and subsequently fallen into his own trap!
Just when he was on the verge of success, Mu Qiubo grabbed his ankle and dragged him into the Spatial Gate together!
…
*Whoosh~*
Yu Hua and Mu Yuan had arrived at the Spatial Gate at almost the same time. Xia Fei had used the impressive Chain Blockade technique, which Yu Hua had spotted in the distance and gone toward. This was the signal Xia Fei and Yu Hua had agreed on. When this move was used, Yu Hua would immediately know that Xia Fei was in danger.
“What’s going on? Young miss? Where’s the young miss?” Mu Yuan stomped his feet and demanded. Mu Yuan’s frustration was obvious, having fallen for Mu Qiubo’s misdirection scheme.
Yu Hua’s complexion was ashen. He walked up to the Spatial Gate, his eyes fixed on the still spinning gauge.
This was not a good sign. Spatial Gates were intricately designed, and there was no telling where random coordinates would send a person. Anyone sent through the gate in this state would find death, nine chances out of ten!
‘Was it Xia Fei or Mu Fuping or the two of them together?’ Yu Hua mentally asked himself.
As his finger stopped the spinning gauge, Yu Hua seemed to age three years. If Xia Fei died after going through a tampered Spatial Gate, the Yu family would only lose a future powerful warrior. However, if Mu Fuping died, his clan would be facing a calamity! The fury of the Nine Great Clans was not something any mortal could endure!
“Eh? The gauge seemed to be spinning earlier,” Mu Yuan said in confusion.
“Oh, no! Young miss didn’t go through, did she?!”
Mu Yuan’s eyes were instantly streaked with blood! His hands seized his disheveled hair, trembling in pain and grief!
“Young miss… if something happens to the young miss, it’s not just me who must die! All one million people of your Yu family will compensate with your lives!”
Mu Yuan seemed to have turned into a completely different person, his expression fiendish as he spoke.
Yu Hua was so startled that he could not speak.
“Who are you?”
“That’s quite the big tone you’re talking with!”
Several Yu family’s warriors, who did not know the truth of the situation, rudely spoke. Mu Yuan immediately lunged out, grabbing the nearest warrior and tearing him apart!
“I’ll say it again! If something happens to the young miss, none of you shall even think about leaving this place alive!”
At this moment, the Spatial Gate suddenly activated!
A frantic figure came through. It was none other than the woman disguised as a man, Mu Fuping!
“Young miss!” Mu Yuan immediately rushed over and prostrated at Mu Fuping’s feet.
“Young miss, are you okay? You scared Old Yuan to death! Old Yuan deserves to die! For not taking good care of the young miss, I should die! I should die!”
Mu Yuan began slapping himself. These were real hits, with shattered teeth and blood flying out of his mouth!
Yu Hua was stunned, and he immediately felt like he understood something.
Mu Yuan was an esteemed Great Law Emperor!
Yu Hua had just exchanged blows with him, so he was keenly aware of his power, but upon seeing how Mu Fuping, a Great Law Emperor, had seemingly lost control of himself. Yu hua could tell that Mu Fuping’s status was even greater than what he had formerly speculated!
Mu Fuping stopped Mu Yuan and said, “You were following me?”
“I deserve death! I deserve death! It was Miss Qingping who had me follow the Young Miss!”
Mu Yuan had already beaten himself into a miserable state, and he was even mumbling about how he should die.
Yu Hua let out a deep sigh and walked over. Since Mu Fuping was safe, the Yu family had avoided disaster.
“Lady Mu, all is well so long as you are okay.”
Mu Fuping frowned and scanned the ground. She viciously asked, “Where’s Xia Fei? That man is too unreasonable! He actually threw me into the Spatial Gate like I was a ball! It’s good that the other side of the gate was Gloryrise City and not some dangerous place.”
Yu Hua was a very smart man and immediately understood what was going on.
“Xia Fei apparently went through the Spatial Gate, but I don’t know where he went,” Yu Hua said. “The Spatial Gate is watched by security cameras, so we can find out by viewing the footage.”
Mu Fuping was actually a rather good-tempered girl. It was just that Xia Fei had pushed his palm against her breasts when throwing her at the Spatial Gate, leaving her somewhat embarrassed. Moreover, he had done so with such strength that they were still sore, leading her to feel somewhat vexed.
Yu Hua played the security footage several times, and the scene became eerily still. That small stone was like the plaything of fate, pushing Xia Fei into a tampered Spatial Gate!
Mu Fuping went pale, tightly biting down on her lip.



Chapter-548-Rainbow-Ice-Coffin
Chapter 548: Rainbow Ice Coffin 
Mu Qiubo had grabbed Xia Fei by the ankle and dragged him into the Spatial Gate.
“DIE!”
Mu Qiubo roared as he threw Xia Fei out!
Xia Fei curled up his body into a ball, his Liquid War armor tightly enclosing him.
*Rumble!*
Xia Fei’s body collided with an iceberg, blasting open a hole as his body went through!
The flexibility of Liquid War armor provided him excellent protection, and though Xia Fei entered the iceberg like a bullet, he simply felt some numbness on his body and some dizziness, but he did not suffer any serious wounds.
The iceberg was enormous and covered in a thick layer of snow. The enormous shaking triggered an avalanche! In truth, the icebergs for the surrounding several hundred kilometers were all trembling!
Mu Qiubo’s eyes widened. Only now did he realize that he had come to an unfamiliar place. White glaciers as far as the eye could see and a strange rainbow flatly stretching out on the horizon… Everything was bizarre and cold!
*Bang!*
The iceberg behind Mu Qiubo began collapsing, starting from the middle. The upper half of the iceberg began to topple toward the location of the Spatial Gate!
“Not good!”
Mu Qiubo ran into the distance, and the snow and ice pursued. In the blink of an eye, that lonely little Spatial Gate was obliterated!
The enormous chunks of ice weighed ten thousand tons, and not even the Spatial Gate could stop it. However, Mu Qiubo was not too concerned about it. Although he did not know spatial traversal, he had a Spatial Compass that he could use.
The intense avalanche lasted for half an hour, and when the calamity was finally over, the field of ice had been completely transformed!
Mu Qiubo frowned. He could not see Mu Fuping anywhere in the area, but he had only been a bit behind her in going through the Spatial Gate. There was no way she could have run off so soon.
Mu Qiubo began to feel that something was wrong. His sharp senses told him that the key to the problem lied was Xia Fei.
“Spatial Recombination!”
Mu Qiubo came to the base of the mountain where Xia Fei was buried, and large chunks of ice and snow began to fly into the air, tossed far away.
Slowly, the mountain of ice began shrinking. If Xia Fei was hiding in the snow, he would be exposed eventually.
“He’s starting to search for you. What do we do?” Phantom grimly asked.
Xia Fei was hiding beneath a thick layer of ice, using his sharp sensory abilities to observe his surroundings. He was well aware that at the current rate at which the iceberg was disappearing, Mu Qiubo would discover him in less than five minutes.
Xia Fei had no confidence in taking on a Law Emperor of the Mu family, so he was determined to escape this place first.
*Whoosh!*
The Liquid War armor charged forms again, turning Xia Fei’s hands into sharp and cold blades. He swung his arms in a frenzy and began digging his way through the ice.
Mu Qiubo was trying to move away the ice and find Xia Fei, while the latter was digging a path to escape. If the two met, they would have to fight a bitter battle. At present, it was now a contest to see which was faster, Mu Qiubo’s ability to move mountains or Xia Fei’s ability to dig a path!
Mu Qiubo suddenly grunted and took out two grade 4 Origin Crystals. Using law energy to move an iceberg was extremely taxing, and as a Law Emperor, he could not keep it up for very long. Thus, while using law energy, he used crystals to restore his energy.
Speed ability users did not just have fast feet. Their hands could also move fast!
Xia Fei’s arms could swing several hundred times every minute. An ordinary person would not even be able to see what he was doing, only a blur.
In the space of a few minutes, the iceberg had disappeared, and Xia Fei was about ten kilometers away from Mu Qiubo.
*Bang!*
Xia Fei emerged from the ice like an excavator, advancing toward that bizarre rainbow in the distance!
“Trying to run?!”
Mu Qiubo’s figure suddenly disappeared, and a second later, he was behind Xia Fei!
Xia Fei’s speed exceeded thirty thousand meters per second! Mu Qiubo had noted Xia Fei’s location and instantly moved there, but by the time he appeared where Xia Fei had been standing, Xia Fei had already run another several dozen kilometers, leaving him far behind!
Rows of nails sprouted from his feet. With each step, the nails would dig into the ice, helping Xia Fei keep his footing. Wherever he went, flecks of ice would fly into the air, creating an artificial snowstorm.
Mu Qiubo creased his brows, a cold smile on his lips.
*Whoosh~*
He moved again, but this time, Mu Qiubo had calculated Xia Fei’s route and appeared in front of him, blocking the path forward!
“Oh, no!”
Mu Qiubo extended an arm, releasing enormous amounts of law force. The ice suddenly became a giant wave which spanned ten kilometers, hurtling toward Xia Fei!
“Crafty Approach!”
He moved his body like an ice skater making a turn, his body leaning at suc h an acute angle that his head was almost touching the ice.
A ninety-degree turn!
This was an absurd movement technique! Xia Fei’s sudden change in direction was enough to let him escape Mu Qiubo’s attack.
Mu Qiubo continued pursuing Xia Fei, and Xia Fei continued using the same tactic, utilizing Crafty Approach and his speed ability to escape Mu Qiubo’s attacks again and again.
Mu Qiubo suddenly realized that Xia Fei was even more slippery than the crafty mudfish. Although he was much stronger than Xia Fei, capturing him was not easy.
“High-rank martial technique, Thunderwood Rampart!”
Mu Qiubo gritted his teeth and mustered up all his energy to use his strongest entrapment technique!
A sphere! A giant spherical spatial barrier suddenly appeared!
It had a radius of one hundred kilometers!
This also meant that any person or creature within one hundred kilometers was imprisoned by this spatial barrier!
Even at maximum speed, Xia Fei needed 3.3 seconds to run one hundred kilometers, and this was on ice, which limited Xia Fei’s speed. He could only run twenty-five thousand meters per second.
One hundred kilometers was an enormous distance, and it was clear that it was beyond Xia Fei’s abilities to break!
At almost the same time, the two grade 4 Origin Crystals in Mu Qiubo’s hand ran out of energy, becoming nothing more than useless transparent crystals. From this, one could see that the Thunderwood Rampart took up an enormous amount of energy.
*Whoosh!*
Mu Qiubo held a jade-green Origin Crystal with both hands. This was a grade 5 Origin Crystal! It held a veritable sea of energy!
“Spatial Constriction!”
The sphere of one hundred kilometers in radius began shrinking, and all people or objects within this space began being compressed! If Xia Fei could not break out of this spatial barrier soon, he would be crushed by the increasing pressure!
Mu Qiubo’s expression turned savage! The grade 5 Origin Crystal in his hand had greatly dimmed. There was no telling how much energy he had used at this moment!
“Primal Chaos!”
As he accelerated, the power of the Law of Primal Chaos gathered in Xia Fei’s right fist!
“Shatter it!”
A furious roar! Xia Fei’s iron fist clashed against the pressure of Mu Qiubo’s spatial barrier!
Crackling resounded in the air like the sound of bamboo explosively growing in the spring!
Mu Qiubo’s high-rank spatial barrier shattered!
From Xia Fei’s one punch!
*Bang!*
As he staggered out of the shattered barrier, Xia Fei felt a sweetness in his throat, and then he vomited blood!
On the other end, Mu Qiubo scowled. He had already reached his limit, his body emptied of energy. This was the inevitable response to using multiple high-rank techniques in a row!
Pushing through the pain in his organs, Xia Fei staggered to his feet. He held a grade 4 Origin Crystal in his hand to recover energy as he continued retreating.
There was nothing Mu Qiubo could do. He had not recovered his energy, so let alone martial techniques, he could not even do instant movement.
The ice field in front of him suddenly became flat and weird. That strange rainbow turned out to be giant pillars of ice, each one several dozen kilometers high and of a different color. They surrounded the field of ice, their colors reflecting onto the sky and turning it into a rainbow.
‘Eh? What is this place?’ Xia Fei wondered to himself in amazement.
However, before Xia Fei could react, his body ran into an invisible wall. Compared to the hardness of a spatial barrier, this invisible wall was like cotton, and Xia Fei’s body sank into it.
It had rubber-like properties, where greater pressure created a more powerful repulsive force. Xia Fei felt like the wall was getting tougher and tougher, and he was on the verge of being bounced back!
“Law of Primal Chaos!”
Xia Fei covered his entire body with the energy of the Law of Primal Chaos. The disruptive energy was miraculous that this law suddenly became like sea water, no longer resisting Xia Fei and allowing his body to go through.
In this inexplicable manner, Xia Fei penetrated through that invisible wall, and what appeared before him was a bizarre sight! There was nothing but colors before his eyes!
Several minutes later, Mu Qiubo arrived. He was also blocked by this soft and invisible wall. Behind the massive pillars of ice were bright and garish lights. It seemed like this was a barrier created by this light.
Xia Fei turned his head and saw Mu Qiubo standing a dozen or so meters away. Mu Qiubo did not have the Law of Primal Chaos, so he was pushed back by the barrier.
It was impossible to hear sounds from outside the wall while within it. Xia Fei could only make out Mu Qiubo’s furious face as he unleashed attacks on the wall, but unfortunately for him, his attacks were insufficient to break the wall.
Regardless, he was safe. Exhaling, Xia Fei began stabilizing his breathing and checked for injuries to his organs.
There was nothing Mu Qiubo could do, so he gestured at Xia Fei, his meaning being that: “You’ll have to come out of there one day.”
He took out a golden compass from his ring, and then his face once more twisted in rage. It appeared that a Spatial Compass could not help him. He was also imprisoned here.
Xia Fei felt a throb of pain from his stomach. Turning around, Xia Fei ignored Mu Qiubo and entered the rainbow of light, and he soon vanished from sight.
…
Xia Fei was surrounded by colors as if he were in a rainbow.
*Ka-chunk!*
The spectrum visor, which came with the Liquid War armor, popped out. Xia Fei tried using it several times to peer into the distance, but to no avail. It was as if this mess of color possessed some sort of isolation effect, and his equipment was incapable of filtering out the extraneous light.
With no other option, Xia Fei could only close his eyes and advance through the light. After that intense battle, what he needed the most was rest.
“These colorful lights are very strange. They don’t have any energy pulses, the same as that invisible wall before,” Phantom said with a frown. “Does it not have an energy body? Is it pure light? Pure light without energy? That doesn’t make much sense.”
Xia Fei ignored him. He had many more problems on his mind.
Suddenly, the rainbow of lights disappeared. Xia Fei was in the middle of a completely transparent and pure field of ice. The exquisite chunks of ice were free of all impurities, seeming like perfectly flat mirrors.
In the distance was a pyramid-shaped platform made from blocks of ice, and on top of the platform was a coffin.
A coffin made from both ice and light!
It was incredibly bizarre!



Chapter-549-The-Demon-Race
Chapter 549: The Demon Race 
“What is this place?” Phantom asked in confusion.
This space was enclosed by a rainbow of lights, and under their feet was a mirror-like plain of ice. In the distance was a pyramid made of ice and a rainbow ice coffin.
“Could this be a tomb? To think such a tomb exist in the universe, I wonder who could be buried here?”
Xia Fei was just as confused as Phantom. He could only find out the truth with his eyes, so after taking a deep breath, Xia Fei walked over to the ice coffin.
The pyramid platform had 999 steps in all, and flanking the stairs were statues of ice monsters with bared teeth and fangs. They had peculiar poses, their expressions streaked with madness. When walking among them, one could not help but be terrified.
The ice coffin at the top was circled by a rainbow. Its length was twenty meters and its height and width were five meters each.
Lying inside was a suit of black armor which was completely sealed off so that it was impossible to know if there was a body inside. It was such a massive suit of armor that anyone inside would have to be of comparably massive size.
Xia Fei tried pushing the coffin, but unfortunately, no matter how much he pushed, the coffin did not move a hair.
Bizarre! Truly bizarre!
Xia Fei lit a cigarette and sat down on the ice platform, hoping to relax a little.
Furball yawned and snuggled against Xia Fei’s neck. It was a very heartless fellow, not worried at all that Xia Fei was imprisoned in this strange field of ice. ITs only worry was presumably that sleeping here was not as comfortable as sleeping at home.
“What is this place?” Xia Fei muttered to himself as he puffed out a smoke ring.
Phantom sighed. Just when he was about to express his confusion, a voice came from the black suit of armor inside the coffin!
“These are the Eternal Ice Plains.”
*Zing!*
Xia Fei’s hair stood on end as he jumped to his feet!
That black suit of armor in the ice coffin had turned its head to him. There was an alloy visor over his face, making the man inside seem like a robot!
“Who are you?” Xia Fei asked sternly.
“And who are you? How were you able to penetrate through the Law of Light and enter this place?”
The voice from the armor was deep and old, tinged with a majesty that could not be denied.
“My name is Xia Fei.” He took a step back and bent a knee. Xia Fei made sure he had enough energy stored so that he could respond to any sudden change in the situation.
“There is no need to be nervous. The Law of Light imprisons me, and I pose no threat to you.” The suit of armor sighed. “I don’t even remember how long I’ve been imprisoned. It’s nice to talk to someone else. You may call me Old Sable.”
Old Sable? It was a very plain name, but no matter how Xia Fei saw it, this Old Sable was not a good sort. His massive body alone was extremely intimidating.
“You still haven’t answered me. Why were you able to penetrate the Law of Light?”
“Are you saying that those multicolored lights is the Law of Light? How come I’ve never heard of it before?”
Old Sable chuckled. “You’re a human, belonging to the God Race, so you naturally wouldn’t understand one of the Great Laws of the Demon Race. Not only are those colored lights Law of Light, they’re the supreme Law of Ternary Spectrum.
“Everyone knows that colors are all a combination of red, green, and blue, the purest and most striking colors. The three primary colors can be mixed into the majority of colors, but the other colors can’t be mixed into the three primary colors. Upon mastering the laws of the three primary colors, one attains the Law of Ternary Spectrum, the supreme law across the Law of Light’s range.”
Xia Fei frowned. “You’re a member of the Demon Race?”
Old Sable unhappily asked, “Must I be a human? Just because you’re a human, I have to be human. too? Why couldn’t I be a member of the Demon Race?”
Xia Fei was speechless. It seemed that the demon imprisoned in the coffin was rather opinionated.
“Moreover, your attitude changed so much upon hearing that I belonged to the Demon Race. Do you really think that the God Race represents righteousness while the Demon Race represents evil?”
Perhaps because he had not spoken with anyone for a long time, Old Sable began a long lecture about principles, constantly emphasizing that there was no such thing as absolute evil or good in the universe, and Xia Fei could not help but get annoyed.
“Why is this demon such a chatterbox?” Phantom said with a frown.
“The God Race and Demon Race aren’t actually races. I’ll use you as an example. Through cultivation, humans can also become members of the God Race. In truth, the God Race has always been a faction formed by the top-class experts of various major races in the universe. Whether one can become a member of the God Race depends on one’s cultivation, not one’s background. As long as your cultivation is enough, you will be accepted into the God Race, joining a group consisting of the strongest experts in the universe.
“Of course, because humans stand behind the God Race, they have no chance of joining the Demon Race. The gods and demons are opponents who are vying for authority over the Cosmic Gate—a battle which has been fought since time immemorial.
Through Old Sable’s words, Xia Fei gradually developed a deeper understanding of these two supreme races. Rather than races or clans, they were actually two different factions that had split off from the collective mass of Law Adepts.
All the clans of the circle had to pick a side, either the God Race or the Demon Race.
Groups of the strongest Adepts? Xia Fei could not help but be curious about these two supreme races. What sorts of groups of old monsters were they?
“The God Race has the Time, Space, and Matter laws. The Demon Race controls the Light, Darkness, and Life laws. These six laws are the supreme Great Laws, and from them, countless other laws were derived.
“I cultivate the Darkness Law, and dark and light counter each other. My foe dispersed all my energy and then used the supreme Law of Ternary Spectrum to imprison me. Fortunately, I have an inextinguishable life, or else I would have been annihilated long ago.”
Old Sable began chattering about his experiences, and after a few moments of silent thought, Xia Fei asked, “You have an eternal life because you studied the Life Law?”
Nodding, Old Sable said, “Indeed. I have an eternal life, and if he were to obliterate me, I would be reborn and once more regain my law powers! Thus, he doesn’t dare to kill me as killing me would be helping me.”
There existed such a miraculous law that allowed rebirth in the universe? Xia Fei was shocked. Was there anyone in the universe who did not want an eternal life? Was immortality not the ultimate goal that all warriors sought through cultivation?
Xia Fei was tempted by these laws that Old Sable spoke of, but his outstanding analytical sense told him that there was some other meaning in these seemingly casually spoken words.
“Who is the one outside who came with you?” Old Sable asked.
“You could sense him?”
Old Sable smiled. “Nothing that happens here on the Eternal Ice Plains can be hidden from me, but while I can see and hear, I can’t do anything about it.”
Xia Fei nodded. “Outside is my enemy. He’s stronger than me, and he chased me all the way here.”
“Oh, I see,” Old Sable indifferently said. “In truth, it’s very simple. You just need to kill him. Alas, your strength is still lacking. Nothing, not even the holy beast Shatterstar, can help you with that.”
He seemed to be trying to entice Xia Fei. Xia Fei smiled. “It’s fine. I have time.”
Saying this, Xia Fei walked down the pyramid, sat cross-legged on the ice, and proceeded to ignore Old Sable.
Phantom anxiously said, “This Demon Race monster must have been incredibly powerful in the past. He must have a way to deal with that fellow outside. Why not ask him to teach you a few moves?”
Xia Fei shook his head, sternly saying, “It’s not that simple. He’s waiting for me to ask for help.”
“What do you mean?” Phantom did not get what Xia Fei was saying.
“Old Sable knows that I have the power of the Law of Primal Chaos and that I can use it to break the Law of Ternary Spectrum that has him sealed here. If it’s you who had been imprisoned for tens of thousands of years, wouldn’t you want to borrow my strength to escape?”
“Is there a need to ask? Even if I had to beg, I would beg for you to break the seal,” Phantom said.
Xia Fei chuckled. “You think that, and so does Old Sable. He tells me how powerful he is on purpose, and then he points out how bad my current situation is. This is precisely so that I would ask him for help.”
“The moment I ask for his help, I’ll have fallen into his trap. He will definitely have me release him as compensation. Do you think I should agree or not?”
Phantom asked, “What’s bad about that? Just release him. In any case, he’s lost all his power, so he poses no threat to you.”
Xia Fei sternly said, “That’s all based on his words alone. What if he hasn’t lost his power?”
“Then you would be in danger,” Phantom stroked his chin and said. From the name of the Demon Race alone, he could tell that Old Sable was very powerful. Xia Fei would be no match to him.
“Then what do we do? Just stay here for the rest of our lives?” Phantom asked.
Xia Fei said nothing. Taking out the upgraded Black Bat radar, he attempted to get in touch with Avril. Alas, there was no signal. This was how the Law Realm was. The signal could be good or bad at times.
“Let’s just plan as we go. In any case, I don’t wish to let this demon out.”
“Then you’ll die imprisoned here. There’s a high-ranked Law Emperor outside waiting for you to throw yourself into his net,” Phantom said.
Xia Fei took out a grade 3 Origin Crystal from his spatial ring and handed it to Furball, softly saying, “Let’s wait and see who breaks first. Anyway, I have enough crystal reserves to last for a long time. Patience is also a form of cultivation.”
Just as Xia Fei said, that demon Old Sable had been trying to get Xia Fei to ask for his help, but he had not expected for Xia Fei to be even more patient than he was, actually beginning to cultivate in this region surrounded by the Law of Light.
With the white jade ape in hand, Xia Fei used up the Origin Crystals and began patiently cultivating all calm and composed, barely looking any different from when he was residing in the Yu family. If there was one difference, it would be that it was quieter. People like Yu Qiqi or Mu Fuping would not suddenly jump out and disturb him.
Patience was a very valuable attribute of a warrior, and not falling to temptation had always been the basis of Xia Fei’s survival until now.
In this prison, Xia Fei was abnormally calm and patient. Outside, Mu Qiubo wanted to leave, but the Spatial Compass was ineffective, meaning that he could not leave even if he wanted to.
Letting out a long sigh, Xia Fei petted Furball and said, “Your master’s Space Law has reached level 7! You have to grow up fast, too. In any case, we have plenty of Origin Crystals, so let’s seclude ourselves here for ten years! We shall stay here until we can beat that fellow outside!”
Old Sable was stunned. Xia Fei was clearly saying these words for him to hear.
‘Have plenty of Origin Crystals?
‘Seclude ourselves here for ten years?’
Old Sable was speechless.
‘Hmph! I simply refuse to believe that there’s anyone who can actually resist the allure of the Law of Life.’ Old Sable inwardly fumed.



Chapter-550-Different-Paths-Leading-to-the-Same-Goal
Chapter 550: Different Paths Leading to the Same Goal 
Eternal Ice Plains.
Cultivating law was like that. Everything came naturally after crossing a threshold. A majority of Law Warriors would fall at the threshold, but Xia Fei had managed to clear the first important roadblock with Yu Hua’s help and reached level 6. His cultivation after seemingly went out of control, and in just the span of a short week, he consecutively cleared level seven and eight.
Old Sable from the Demon Race of course intently saw everything transpire, and he was equally surprised like everyone else. It was as if Xia Fei’s promotion state was a geyser that no one could stop!
As the Immortal Demonlord that had existed for millions of years, Old Sable naturally possessed outstanding knowledge, and he had of course seen countless geniuses, as well as people who could go up in levels with the ease of chopping up vegetables, but Xia Fei’s ability to improve by leaps and bounds, anytime, any place, had left him completely flabbergasted!
Xia Fei lit a cigarette. The injuries he sustained several days ago had all healed, and leveling up had him brimming with vigor, enough that it staved off any lethargy he was feeling from his crazy cultivation.
“Xia Fei,” Old Sable called his name.
“Yeah?” Xia Fei turned around and asked.
“Has the speed of your promotion always been this fast?”
Xia Fei shook his head. “My brain region was badly damaged before, so I relied on medicine and drugs to promote my cultivation at first, but there’s ultimately a limit to what they could do, and I ended up stalling at the Legendary rank for three years, unable to make any progress whatsoever until I managed to repair my seventh brain region.”
Old Sable chuckled. “I bet that you didn’t stop cultivating during those three years, huh?”
Xia Fei nodded. “I didn’t slack in the slightest.”
Old Sable nodded. “Now I see. Though your brain region was ruined, you didn’t once give up on cultivation. As a result, the moment your brain region made a full recovery, the cultivation you had accumulated from before allowed you to increase the speed of your promotion. If I’m not mistaken, that three-year accumulation only will end after you achieve the cultivation of Law Sovereign, and the speed of your promotion will slow down by then.”
Xia Fei asked, somewhat puzzled, “I’ve only been cultivating my special ability before; what has that got to do with law?”
Old Sable burst out laughing. “Looks like you don’t have too much understanding with regards to law. Have you heard of the saying: ‘Different paths lead to the same goal’?”
“Different paths lead to the same goal?” Xia Fei’s brows furrowed. “What does that mean?”
“Take life as an example; no matter how exciting or boring you lead your life, be it a rich life or a poor life, you’ll ultimately end up dying. Different processes with the same result. This itself is an eternal rule of the universe.
“Cultivation is just the same. Whether you start with cultivating law or if you first cultivate your special ability before changing over to law, the end goal remains the same, and that is the acquisition of supreme power.”
Xia Fei was slightly stunned. The words Old Sable had said sounded very reasonable. Previously, Xia Fei had always thought that being born with special abilities was the strongest power in the universe, until he discovered the existence of the Law Realm and realized that talent in law without any special ability could be equally as powerful, if not even more so.
“The Law Realm originally didn’t exist and only came to be created by a group of ability users. They too went through the same path you’re taking, first by cultivating their special abilities and then comprehending law force in the process. From this point alone, you have an advantage in having spent plenty of effort learning your special ability, while if you’re born in the Law Realm, your starting point will begin with law and will lack the special ability foundation.
“Your special ability is speed, and that is your Innate Law.”
“Innate Law? Is the speed ability a law in itself?” Xia Fei curiously asked.
“But of course. What did you think would be the final state you could reach cultivating your speed ability?”
“Achieving lightspeed,” Xia Fei answered somberly. “To have a speed that is as fast as light.”
Old Sable shook his light lightly. “Wrong! The speed ability will reach its limit upon hitting the Immortal rank, and from then, no matter how much medication you administer to yourself, no matter how hard you train, nothing will matter, unless you pivot to cultivating the Speed Law!”
Xia Fei came to a profound understanding there and then. It was no wonder why the experts in the Alliance would always say that the Immortal rank was the endpoint. It turned out that there was a limit to ability cultivation, so unless they started learning law, they would just end up stagnating there for the rest of their lives!
“In the past, even in the Law Realm, the families and clans would first require the younger generations to cultivate their special abilities to the Immortal rank before getting started on laws. Unfortunately, it seems like the people in the current circle have become more and more impulsive, only recognizing that directly learning law will promote faster, with no one having the patience to spend the hundreds of years needed to cultivate their special ability to its limit.”
Xia Fei smiled. “Thank you. I’ve indeed learned plenty from spending time here with you.”
His words were earnest, and Old Sable laughed. “If you are patient enough, then it’s best if you cultivate your special ability till the end before beginning your study of the Law of Speed. I’m certain that you will have an unexpected gain by doing so.”
Xia Fei knitted his brows together. “But I’ve already learned both the Law of Space and Law of Energy Purification, while my main ability is speed, with a secondary ability of telekinesis. Wouldn’t I be under a lot of pressure if I were to cultivate so many altogether?”
That was not all. Xia Fei was still keeping mum about the Law of Primal Chaos, and just thinking about all these gave him a headache. There was too much he needed to learn and not enough time to do so. He really wished he could have forty-eight hours in a day or even seventy-two hours.
Old Sable mused. “Two abilities with two laws… That’s indeed tough on a new Law Warrior, but this universe is fair. The more you give, the more you receive in return.”
“That person beyond the Law of Light restricted boundary is a level 4 Law Emperor. Why did he not kill you? The level difference between you two is humongous, and it’s all because of how complex the things you learn that gave you a combat strength well above warriors at your level ”
Xia Fei nodded. Logically speaking, there was no way he ought to be able to retaliate given the huge gap in levels they shared. The only reason why he had managed to escape was all thanks to his speed ability, Crafty Approach, Law of Space, and Law of Primal Chaos working in tandem, turning the impossible possible.
Just one type alone might not have been sufficiently powerful, but they would often demonstrate an unimaginable combat strength when used in conjunction.
“Time!” Old Sable said severely. “To a warrior, aside from energy, the other thing they need the most is time! Only by living a longer life than others, cultivating for a longer time than others, and being more hardworking can you reach the highest reaches of your potential!
“Having a complex system of learning is a benefit, while having a short lifespan is your enemy! Honestly, there aren’t many people in the Law Realm who have embarked on so many different paths like you have; you may end up becoming very powerful, but you will first have to address the issue of your limited life.”
“Oce you cultivate law to a certain point, your lifespan will increase, even to the point where you are near-immortal, but that is very difficult. If you practice the Law of Life, you’ll be able to achieve the same result with half the effort.”
After all that talk, Old Sable finally arrived at the crux of the conversation. Everything he had said prior was just to remind Xia Fei. “I, Old Sable, have the Law of Life. If you wish to learn it, beg me for it.”
Xia Fei, of course, understood his intentions, and he remained wordlessly seated on the ground where he was. He placed a grade 4 Origin Crystal on the white jade ape. Xia Fei had been able to promote two whole levels in seven days all thanks to this thing which could concentrate energy, and now he was preparing to try comprehending the Law of Energy Purification.
Doing the same cultivation would dull the senses and induce lethargy; changing the style of cultivation to something else was like a sort of relaxation to Xia Fei.
Old Sable coldly harrumphed. “Still not gonna beg me for it? I refuse to believe that you’re not tempted by the Law of Life!”
The more he thought about it, the angrier Old Sable got. He had already amply stated the value of his existence, yet Xia Fei was still unmoved. This made him feel irate, and so he turned his body over and no longer faced Xia Fei.
…
That mysterious energy thread in his seventh brain region slowly turned, and Xia Fei began to be more used to this sort of fine control, which inadvertently gave him greater confidence toward his ability to manipulate the thread, and in turn this increased his speed at recreating patterns.
*Snap!*
The complex and changing pattern for the Law of Energy Purification finally solidified, and the numbing sensation of electricity passed through Xia Fei’s entire body as if every single cell in his body had been agitated as a result.
Xia Fei did not stop, as the most important step after formation was the consolidation, which he spent an entire day’s time going over.
Opening his eyes once more, Xia Fei had a smile across his face.
Actually, level 1 Law of Energy Purification was hardly of any use to Xia Fei, for few people would use red grade 1 Origin Crystals. Thus, even though Xia Fei had the ability to purify grade 1 crystals, he would hardly benefit from them.
Nonetheless, this process was also the way to learn it. To Xia Fei, the most important aspect was getting a handle of the technique. After taking plenty of detours and experiencing a lot of frustrations, Xia Fei slowly began comprehending the true meaning behind the Law of Energy Purification.
Wading across a stream while feeling the way would always be difficult, but once successfully making it across, it would give one an even deeper understanding of the process.
“You cultivate in a very strange manner,” Old Sable said with uncertainty. “Who would cultivate the Law of Energy Purification like you did? Which family’s method is that?”
Xia Fei was mildly surprised. “Isn’t that how it’s done? I figured it out on my own.”
Old Sable was flabbergasted. “What? You don’t have a teacher, and you practiced the Law of Energy Purification all by yourself?!”
Xia Fei nodded, not denying the truth.
“That’s impossible! All Energy Masters need not only a natural affinity to the control of energy, they also need to rely on their master’s imparted teachings. How could you become an Energy Master just by cultivating it all on your own?”
The fact remained that, no matter how shocked Old Sable was, Xia Fei had truly managed to complete the first level of the Law of Energy Purification by himself, and he had done it right before his very eyes!
“Heavens! To actually cultivate the Law of Energy Purification successfully through your own probing!” Old Sable was looking at Xia Fei as if he were looking at a monster, hardly hiding a shred of his surprise.
“Why must the Law of Energy Purification require a teacher? Who made such a rule?” Xia Fei asked, dissatisfied. He hated rules the most and was never the sort to follow them, either.
Old Sable pouted. “The Law of Energy Purification is a very difficult path to cultivate, and most circumstances require a high level Energy Master by their side as assistant, or else it will be extremely difficult to succeed.
“That’s why it is so important to have a teacher as an Energy Master. Unless you have a teacher who is willing to help increase your level, it’ll be completely impossible to promote all by yourself. Having a good teacher to help you willingly level is the only way to advance as an Energy Master!”
With that, Old Sable suddenly let out a self-depreciating chortle. “Honestly, even for someone who has lived as long as I… this is the first time meeting a self-taught Energy Master. You’ve really surprised me there.”
Xia Fei shrugged. It was no wonder he had such a hard time cultivating the Law of Energy Purification by himself. It turned out that the reason was he lacked anyone aiding him.
Xia Fei was unfazed by the hardship he faced, though, because he was originally not the sort who liked subjecting himself to others, having to defer to a teacher’s capriciousness, only promoting when he wanted you to. Xia Fei would have hated that sort of life.
In any case, Xia Fei succeeded in the end, and that was what mattered the most. He was now a bonafide Energy Master, and though he was still of low level, at the very least he had managed to get on this path.
Placing Furball on his shoulder, Xia Fei began walking toward the periphery of the Law of Light’s restriction boundary.
“Where are you going?” Old Sable asked, intrigued. “That guy who’s after you has yet to leave… Are you trying to get yourself killed?”



Chapter-551-In-Furballs-Lifetime
Chapter 551: In Furball’s Lifetime 
Xia Fei passed through the thick colors and was now by the edge of the restriction boundary set by Law of Ternary Spectrum. He squatted without a sound and observed the situation outside.
There did not seem to be any trace of Mu Qiubo anywhere, but just as Xia Fei was about to turn back, he noticed ice chips whipping up in flight from quite far away, as if a blizzard was coming.
“Hmm? There seems… to be a battle unfolding over there,” Phantom said hesitantly.
Xia Fei furrowed his brows. The boundary, which was in his way, made it hard to make out what was happening that far out, but he slowly used his Law of Primal Chaos, piercing through the boundary and moving toward the commotion while using Breath Control with light footsteps.
*Kaboom!*
The sound of battle grew louder and louder. Xia Fei took a closer look and saw that a large pack of snow-white spiders had surrounded Mu Qiubo, who was hiding within his spatial barrier with a listless look on his face. He held onto a green Origin Crystal in hand, as if he was using it to slowly replenish his energy.
“That’s a grade 5 Origin Crystal!” Phantom said excitedly. “That guy has quite the goods on him, to actually take out such a high grade crystal.”
Xia Fei knitted his eyebrows. The snow-white spiders were as big as oxen, and there was a whole mountain of them. There were at least several thousands of them, with many spider carcasses on both sides, most likely killed by Mu Qiubo. However, due to the fact that there were truly too many spiders, to the point that there was no end to them, Mu Qiubo had given up on resisting and chosen to hide behind his barrier with an angry look on his face.
Xia Fei quietly made his way back after checking up on Mu Qiubo’s status. Aside from enemies, there were still legions of strange spiders around; the Eternal Ice Plains sure did not seem to be a peaceful place.
All of a sudden, the ice beneath his feet fissured!
A snow-white spider even bigger than an ox suddenly burst forth from beneath the ice and ambushed Xia Fei. Its eight huge and long legs were like eight sharp spears, its green eyes gleaming with vicious intent, and its mandibles were like a grinder made of countless curved knives!
*Bang!*
Xia Fei suddenly leaped into the air, and with a flick of his wrist, sent Dragonscale Hectoslasher out and immediately chopped off that spider’s two fore legs.
His wrist was in pain!
The claws from the snow-white spider were very sturdy, and the shock from the blow hurt Xia Fei’s wrist!
“Crafty Approach!”
Keeping his body close to the ground, Xia Fei pulled Dragonscale Hectoslasher behind him.
“Dragged Blade style!”
The sharp edge of the sword carved out a circle on the ground, and the remaining six legs of the snow-white spider were all chopped off! The huge body of the spider collapsed onto the ground and it struggled vigorously.
*Pew!*
Furball spat an energy ball right at that spider’s body, and about a fifth of it immediately turned into white smoke!
Xia Fei was shocked. Furball’s attack had the miraculous effect of turning matter into energy, and a single strike actually failed to kill the spider outright. That just went to show how high their grade was!
Not risking negligence, Xia Fei jumped up and stuck his sword right into the spider’s brain!
*Crunch*
The blade plunged into flesh, and Xia Fei gave it a twist, while also implanting the power of the Law of Primal Chaos right into its body, and only then did he manage to end its life.
Xia Fei’s fight drew even more spiders to him, and these creatures were abnormally cunning. They had all hidden themselves beneath the ice in an attempt to wait for the chance to strike. The moment Xia Fei slacked even the slightest, these spiders would all break through the ice and attack him!
Their numbers increased, almost as if the spiders were communicating with one another. The moment one discovered Xia Fei, even more began swarming over!
“Chain Blockade!”
The tornadoes tore through the icy plains, throwing all the spiders everywhere. Even the ice surface cracked!
The power of Chain Blockade was great, and Mu Qiubo discovered Xia Fei’s presence in the distance. He dismissed his spatial barrier and struck the nearest snow-white spider with two punches before he began slaying his way out, leaving a trail of blood after him!
“This is all your fault! Causing yours truly to be trapped here in this bitter cold! I’M GONNA KILL YOU!” Mu Qiubo yelled madly as Xia Fei stooped low. With weird footwork, he escaped from the mass of spiders and retreated through the boundary with his Law of Primal Chaos.
Mu Qiubo did not have the ability to get past the Law of Ternary Spectrum, so he had no choice but to defend from the spiders mobbing him outside, even as he kept bellowing at Xia Fei.
With a smile, Xia Fei stuck a middle finger to Mu Qiubo before turning to leave, nearly infuriating the latter to death.
Returning to the base of the pyramid, Xia Fei wiped his sweat. Those spiders were no issue if fought alone, but there were simply too many of them, and that made it difficult for Xia Fei to handle.
“Have you seen those Ice Spiders yet?” Old Sable asked while chuckling.
Xia Fei nodded. “Most exotic beasts will be scared to the point of cowering when they see Furball, yet for some reason, these spiders barely reacted to his presence.”
Old Sable glanced over at Furball and said, “Your holy beast is pretty good, with great potential to boot. Unfortunately, these Ice Spiders aren’t any exotic beasts, but demonic beasts of the Demon Race, so of course they won’t be afraid of Shatterstar.”
“Demonic beasts?” Xia Fei pursed his lips. Hearing this name caused him to think of the Demon Chrysalis, and obviously these spiders were nowhere as powerful, but they definitely held a superior advantage in terms of numbers.
“Demonic beasts were born from exotic beasts, and after our Demon Race reared them for millions of years, they can now be considered separate species, completely breaking away from the shadows of exotic beasts. These Eternal Ice Plains are the habitats of Ice Spiders, and their numbers are uncountable.”
“Originally, Ice Spiders live very deep underground, but the appearance of you two have disturbed their sleep, so they’ve burrowed up to the surface through tens of thousands meters of ice. That guy outside is about to get really unlucky, for those sleeping Ice Spiders have started to wake up slowly, and their numbers will only increase with each passing day.”
Xia Fei nodded. “What do you know about the Shatterstar beast?”
Xia Fei had previously looked up information pertaining to Furball, but what he found was very general, merely stating how powerful it would become upon reaching adulthood, with barely any additional information.
Old Sable answered, “Holy beasts are very strange creatures. The greatest ability of your Shatterstar beast isn’t in helping you during battle but rather in helping you destroy.”
“Destroy?” Xia Fei furrowed his brows as he turned to Little Furball beside him. “This pet of mine does indeed love destroying things, often eating some really strange things.”
Old Sable laughed. “Holy beasts are mischievous in nature, so that can’t be helped. If you are hoping that your pet can be helpful during battle, then you’ll be sorely mistaken. A Shatterstar’s strongest attack requires a very long time to brew, so if you plan to destroy a planet, it will be suited to hand that task to an adult Shatterstar.”
Xia Fei was confused. “What do you mean by ‘brew’?”
Old Sable replied, “Did you notice how your Shatterstar beast hasn’t been making any progress recently?”
Xia Fei nodded meaningfully. “Indeed, it has been a long time since Furball achieved his second form, learning two types of combat, with the first being attack and the second being defense. He was originally very powerful in the Alliance, but ever since it got to the Law Realm, Furball’s attack has evidently become much weaker.”
Old Sable said, “The reason is simple; You’ve used your Shatterstar beast too much, causing him to no longer have enough accumulated energy! What a waste of a treasure! A dignified holy beast reduced to be your henchman.”
Xia Fei said, “Furball has been eating so many of my Origin Crystals. What’s wrong with getting him to help me here and there?”
Old Sable shook his head. “You don’t understand at all; a holy beast Shatterstar can only attack once in its whole life!”
“Once in its whole life?!”
“That’s right! A Shatterstar beast will only consume energy from birth, and with the greatest vitality bestowed upon it by this universe, it is capable of demonstrating devastating catastrophe!
“It will be a singular attack that is paid for with life! The entire universe will be shaken by it! No one can compare! The real reason why the holy beast Shatterstar is called a holy beast is its disregard for the universe!
“You’re very fortunate to have taken in a holy beast, but you’re also a fool to have used him like a common combat exotic beast,” Old Sable said discourteously.
Xia Fei shook all over! He looked in surprise at Furball.
So Furball was actually such an impressive holy beast!
Living its whole life just to make one attack!
A catastrophe that could shake the entire universe—all caused by it!
It was hard to imagine just how shocking this one attack could be!
Could it tear the entire universe apart!?
“Looks like the Law Realm has truly declined… The man who owns the holy beast Shatterstar doesn’t even know what his pet does.” Old Sable sighed, feeling sorry for Furball.
Fireball seemed to understand Old Sable’s words, but he just quietly snuggled up next to Xia Fei, looking up at him with big eyes.
“One day, when you meet an unimaginably powerful opponent, able to cause black holes to collapse with the raise of his hand, and their kick can cause a galaxy to flow backward, when that time comes, the only thing you can rely on is that insignificant looking little ball beside you. It will use its life and the energy which has accumulated its entire life to disintegrate that opponent!”
In Old Sable’s great agitation, his voice had already become hoarse!
“After dealing this one attack, the duty of the Shatterstar beast will also be over. All its mischievousness, laziness, and peculiarities will disappear with its death, and in a certain corner of the universe, another holy beast Shatterstar will be born. It will repeat what its ancestors did, absorbing energy for a lifetime before unleashing one attack.
“Every holy beast is unique and they have no kin to speak of, nor will they give birth. The only thing it can do is reincarnate time and again.”
Not just Xia Fei, even Phantom was extremely surprised upon learning all these!
Who would have guessed that the seemingly weak little life would bear such a heavy burden?
Behind its indolent and delinquent ways was actually a fearless soul!
Xia Fei’s impression of Furball suddenly shot high up. He had never imagined that Furball would become his strongest reliance and that the beast would be the only one who could save him when faced with an enemy he could not defeat!
The final trump card!
A trump card that could turn the tables!
Xia Fei secretly made the decision never to use Furball again, letting him slowly grow up and become his most powerful backup.
However, to exchange the energy the beast accumulated his entire life and his life himself for the most powerful attack, Xia Fei felt that such a life and reincarnation to be a bit cruel.
Though Xia Fei would often beat and scold this lazy ball, his feelings for him were very deep. To exchange Furball’s life for an insane attack, Xia Fei was very reluctant, thinking that it would be better if he could just keep his pet around him forever.
He pulled out a grade 3 Origin Crystal to feed Furball, who happily ate it, very grateful to his master.
“Your holy beast Shatterstar needs to undergo nine transformations before he can reach adulthood, and it’s not long before he will reach his third transformation. Most likely because he has been growing beside you, he gained a decent temperament. Treat him well from here on out, and maybe one day, you’ll be able to rely on him.”
Xia Fei nodded. Even if Old Sable had not said that, Xia Fei would definitely treat Furball well, too.
Changing the topic, Old Sable asked, “There’s something I don’t get, though… You actually already own the powerful Nature-class Immemorial Mystical Armament, Peacock Blue, so why have I never seen you use it?”



Chapter-552-Harnessing-an-Immemorial-Mystic-Armament
Chapter 552: Harnessing an Immemorial Mystic Armament 
“You actually already own the powerful Nature-class Immemorial Mystical Armament, Peacock Blue, so why have I never seen you use it?”
Xia Fei was startled, involuntarily touching his right wrist. That thin and weak small grass was onto his arm, with its two blades of grass already grown.
Xia Fei of course knew just how powerful Peacock Blue was, and the tenacious resilience it had shown when he killed the Demon Chrysalis was shocking, practically saving Xia Fei single-handedly from the clutches of death. However, Xia Fei really had no idea how to use this powerful Nature-class armament.
Shrugging, Xia Fei helplessly answered, “Honestly, I don’t have a clue how to use Peacock Blue.
First he was stunned, then Old Sable let out a long and raucous laughter, nearly going out of breath from laughing too much.
“Someone who has an Immemorial Mystical Armament has no idea how to use it? Who is this expert who has done this? To give you Peacock Blue yet not tell you how to use it? HAHAHAHAHA!”
Old Sable’s words were a bit unkind, for the Black and White Gods actually quite had their eyes on Xia Fei. It was too bad that they had yet to make contact with Xia Fei, though, seeing as they were already being hunted after coming up with the Law of Primal Chaos. They were barely able to keep the hides on their back, so of course there was no way that they would have the time to speak or explain things to Xia Fei.
The powerful Law of Primal Chaos was actually Xia Fei’s hidden concern. He had absolutely no idea that the God Race had already deemed it as taboo, but it was a good thing Xia Fei had yet to come across anyone from the two High Races, or else it would have caused quite the stir. Trouble was like that; while it had yet to rear its ugly head, it was actually hiding somewhere, waiting for the chance to strike.
Old Sable finally managed to stop himself from laughing as he said in a deep voice, “Peacock Blue is an Immemorial Mystic Armament, with a powerful combat strength. Calling it the most resilient weed in the universe is by no means a pointless namesake.
“I have seen people use such a Nature-class armament more than once, and the effect achieved is very good. It’s said that this Peacock Blue’s greatest function is in breaking defenses and capture. Plenty of warriors in the Law Realm enjoy learning two sets of defense martial arts techniques, like spatial barrier or Darkness Obstruction, which utilizes Law force to defend against attacks.
“Peacock Blue has its overpowering tenacity, able to penetrate the toughest barriers and forcefully capture the enemy.”
Xia Fei’s ears perked up upon hearing this. If he could learn the method to harness Peacock Blue, no doubt that it would be a great help to him. Using Peacock Blue to seize the enemy meant all he had to do was stab them with a knife, and Xia Fei of course enjoyed that a lot.
“Though Peacock Blue has recognized you as its owner, it has yet to establish any real kind of connection with you. It still needs even more information about you.”
Xia Fei was stunned. “Even more information? Peacock Blue is growing on my right arm, accompanying me day and night. Aren’t we already very familiar with each other?”
Old Sable shook his head. “The reason why he attaches to you is you share the same tenacity and personality, with similar experiences, but this is only enough for you to have it, not control it. If you wish to truly harness it, you will have to pay a hefty price. The armaments and exotic beasts that naturally form in the universe are all very strange; your exclusive beast Furball is a unique holy beast, and Peacock Blue is also the same.”
Xia Fei knitted his eyebrows. “Price? What sort of price?”
Old Sable said in a serious tone, “The price of fresh blood! Cut your right arm a little, and the Peacock Blue will consume your blood until it finally plants itself in your body. Taking your body as nourishment, and your fights as sunlight, it will gradually grow.”
Xia Fei was slightly shocked. “Is this a type of blood sacrifice?!”
“Precisely! A blood sacrifice! Only then will Peacock Blue truly become a part of you and listen to your command!”
“It’s too bad; if you used the blood sacrifice method right from the start, it wouldn’t be hard for Peacock Blue to take root in you. Now that it has grown two grass blades, it will take even more blood before it can completely implant itself on you, and that’s a fair risk you’ll have to undertake. If you’re afraid, it’s not a bad idea to keep it like an ornament. Others will just take it for your tattoo.”
“Afraid? That word has never been part of my vocabulary. As long as the price to pay isn’t disparate from the reward I gain, I won’t even care about the price I must pay,” Xia Fei said firmly.
Old Sable intentionally made it sound like the subjugation of Peacock Blue would be extremely dangerous, but Xia Fei barely spent even 0.1 second to arrive at a conclusion. Such a decisiveness was hardly something most people could display, and the old demon could not help but be moved by it.
With a keen small knife in hand, Xia Fei cut a horizontal wound upon his right arm, and fresh blood came spurting out!
*Whoosh!*
Peacock Blue really began to move!
Its two grass blades perked up, and after examining the wound for a short while, they slowly approached and wrapped themselves against it, taking in blood as a thin vein of red gradually became visible in the plant, similar to the blood vessels found inside a human body!
…
About an hour later, Xia Fei’s wound gradually started to heal up as if Peacock Blue was taking the initiative to help him.
The process was rather alarming. In the beginning, because Xia Fei lost plenty of blood, he felt light-headed, but Peacock Blue soon sent the blood it absorbed back into Xia Fei’s veins, and the blood, which had been through Peacock Blue was purified by it, making it even purer than before!
This came as an additional surprise to Xia Fei, albeit a welcomed one. There was apparently no risk to feeding Peacock Blue his blood; instead, it brought greater benefits to his body!
“You lied to me?” Xia Fei frowned.
Old Sable burst into laughter. “So what if I did? What are you going to do, bite me?”
Xia Fei was unamused. Old Sable was truly part of the Demon Race, his actions all strange and perverse.
“If you look closely, you’ll see that there’s an additional vein of red running through the stem and leaves of Peacock Blue. That is your blood, and the plant has now become a part of your body. Your blood is now its nourishment, and the stronger you become, the faster Peacock Blue will grow.”
Xia Fei shut his eyes and tried to sense that weed on his arm, attempting to control it.
“Contract!”
Peacock Blue suddenly shrank, returning to that small weed it was, coiled up around his arm.
“Expand!”
“Contract!”
“Expand!”
Xia Fei still needed to train and practice in order to achieve the contraction and expansion rate that he desired, and his ability to control Peacock Blue would increase as he became more used to it with frequent use.
After such a long time, Xia Fei had finally gotten the Immemorial Mystic Armament, Peacock Blue, to become part of him, and he was beyond elated.
Getting up, Xia Fei made his way toward the restriction boundary.
Peacock Blue was both a plant and a weapon. The only way to adapt better to the weapon was through battle!
….
Xia Fei quietly avoided Mu Qiubo and searched for traces of spiders out in the Ice Plains.
There were even more Ice Spiders out than what he had seen two days ago, and they were even more frenzied with their attacks, too!
These creatures lived tens of thousands of meters underground, so with Xia Fei and Mu Qiubo suddenly barging into their territory, they all left their nests and got up on land to join in the encirclement of the two interlopers.
The boundary from the Law of Ternary Spectrum was wide, spanning over a hundred miles. Mu Qiubo was in the west, so Xia Fei exited in the east. The moment the former spotted the latter, he would quickly rush over, which was when Xia Fei would duck back behind the safety of the boundary before exiting in another direction that Mu Qiubo would not have expected.
Like a game of cat and mouse, Xia Fei’s speed and physical ability made it difficult for the average human to grasp, and with the tens of thousands of spiders in the way, not once did Mu Qiubo manage to get anywhere near Xia Fei.
“Bind!”
After constant fighting, Xia Fei became more and more accustomed to Peacock Blue, of which the two grass blades could now grow up to thirty centimeters in length!
*Whoosh!*
The blades of grass were like flexible tentacles, tightly wrapping up an Ice Spider like a dumpling. The creature could hardly struggle in that snug grip, and it was all due to the extreme resilience of the plant. If even the great Demon Chrysalis could not withstand it, there was no reason these Ice Spiders would be an exception.
With a twist of his wrist, Xia Fei produced the black and sinister dagger, Blood Crystal, in his hand.
…
*Crunch!*
Blood Crystal very easily plunged into that Ice Spider’s thorax and drained its blood essence ravenously!
After its transformation as a result of the Law of Primal Chaos, Blood Crystal was no longer a dagger that only drained the blood essence of humans; it was now a weapon that could drain whatever blood it came into contact with! Its ferocity had essentially been multiplied by many folds!
Very soon, the Ice Spider began shriveling up and became no more than an empty husk a cicada would molt in the summer. A light flick of the finger and it dissipated like ash!
A single Ice Spider could hardly last three seconds when facing the ravenous draining speed of Blood Crystal! This was definitely an unimaginably terrifying speed; considering that the spiders were at least the size of oxen, the amount of blood that they would have was surely substantial, yet Blood Crystal, a dagger that was barely longer than his handspan, could actually drain one completely in just three seconds! That was a truly insane bloodsucking speed!
Returning to the boundary, Xia Fei sat down cross-legged and used Origin Crystals to alleviate the lethargy he was feeling. At the same time, he continued his cultivation of laws.
“Eighty-seven Ice Spiders? Not bad,” Old Sable softly muttered.
On the second day, Xia Fei shot out like a cannon and risked anew being hunted down by Mu Qiubo to kill Ice Spiders outside.
“A total of 275 today. Looks like he’s getting more and more used to harnessing Peacock Blue,” Old Sable’s mouth twitched as he muttered to himself.
On the third day, 910 Ice Spiders died by Xia Fei’s hands, and his Chain Blockade martial arts technique had reached stage 5! He was only two stages away from the complete stage 7!
On the fourth day, 3255 Ice Spiders were killed.
On the fifth day, it was 9001!
On day six, he rested, choosing to focus all his effort on making a breakthrough with his Wildstorm martial arts technique.
On the seventh day, 10,003 Ice Spiders were killed. Blood Crystal had turned to an even deeper hue of black, and the time it took to drain an Ice Spider had decreased to 2.5 seconds. It was apparent that as Xia Fei massacred these creatures, this ancient and mysterious bloodsucking dagger of his was also growing!
On the eighth day, he rested. Wildstorm had reached stage 5 and was still four stages away from hitting its completion at stage 9.
On the ninth day, he killed 11,265 Ice Spiders. This was already the very limit. After all, there was only so much time in a day, and Xia Fei practically spent every second killing spiders non-stop!
Thus, he spent his days cultivating one moment, and massacring Ice Spiders the next. Xia Fei began his first crazy cultivation and training session since arriving in the Law Realm!
Xia Fei was not the only one growing during this time. Peacock Blue was also becoming even handier to use that he began utilizing and coming up with new tactics he had not used before, allowing Blood Crystal to become more ferocious than ever!
Fourteen days later, Xia Fei’s Law of Space had broken through the level 9 threshold! He was just a step away from becoming a Law Sovereign!
Just like before, Xia Fei quietly made his way out of the Law of Ternary Spectrum boundary, but the entire Eternal Ice Plain was strangely quiet. There was not even one Ice Spider inside!
It must be said that, just two days ago, there were still millions of Ice Spiders swarming the place!
‘Where have they all gone?’ Xia Fei asked himself inwardly with furrowed brows.
Even any signs of Mu Qiubo’s presence were gone, and a foreboding sense once more crept up Xia Fei’s spine.



Chapter-553-Oro,-the-Lionheart-Emperor
Chapter 553: Oro, the Lionheart Emperor 
Returning to the restriction boundary, Xia Fei made his way to the foot of the pyramid with furrowed brows.
“Strange. All the Ice Spiders outside are gone. Even that guy who has set his heart on killing me is gone, too. Something’s not right.” Xia Fei purposely wondered out loud. Old Sable’s mental energy monitored the entire planet, so he most definitely knew just what caused the Ice Spiders’ disappearance.
Old Sable chuckled. “This was originally a very peaceful place, but you and the other man’s sudden appearance broke this peace, so of course the old monsters who live here in the Ice Plains would all be drawn out.”
“Monsters?” Xia Fei pondered over Old Sable’s use of the term ‘monsters’, which very clearly meant that there was not just one. He could not help but become vigilant.
“Would you like to know what’s going on?” Old Sable asked with a smile.
“I do.”
“Then let’s do a trade.”
“What kind of trade?” Xia Fei asked. After waiting for all these days, the old recluse of the Demon Race could finally stand it no longer and spoke, which was exactly what Xia Fei had expected. The fact that he could hold out for so long already showed sufficient patience on his part.
“Kill me,” Old Sable said solemnly.
Xia Fei was slightly taken aback. This demon actually wanted Xia Fei to kill him? In his over twenty years of life, this was the first time Xia Fei had heard of such a request.
“My body has been heavily injured, and there’s no way for me to make a full recovery in this lifetime. That is why I must die, allowing me to be reborn and cultivate from scratch again, train my body, and learn law,” Old Sable very earnestly said.
Xia Fei let out a bitter laugh. “Dying to experience rebirth; experts are truly a different breed altogether; we mortals would rather live wasted lives than die, yet you are seeking death. The power of the Law of Life truly makes others envious.”
“I have to do this because I’m an immortal!”
Old Sable suddenly displayed his outstanding temperament, stating his words with such ease even as he showed his disdain for mere mortals! This was most likely his true personality.
Xia Fei lit a cigarette. “After you are reborn, I’ll still have to bear the anger and ire from peak powerhouses. This is a poor transaction for me, so I won’t do it.”
“I can impart you the Law of Life, the secret law unique to the Demon Race! If you miss this chance, you can forget about ever acquiring it in this life.”
Xia Fei froze slightly. This was a very valuable bargaining chip—a price so high that it was practically priceless!
Humans were a race that stood on the side of the God Race, so even if he were to go up the ranks as per convention, Xia Fei would start from the Yu family before rising to join one of the Nine Great Clans, and ultimately becoming a member of the God Race. Even if he reached the Universal Gate, there would not be any chance for him to come into contact with the Demon Race’s laws.
Of course, this was under ideal conditions. Given Xia Fei’s current understanding of the Law Realm, the difficulty of such a feat far outstripped that of the Alliance. There was no telling when he might fall into another’s trap. Eking a living out in this circle which lacked any righteousness whatsoever was tough, and becoming a powerhouse was even tougher; too many unseen hands in the dark, and too many hidden enemies that kept to the shadows.
Friends? There was no such thing as a friend in the Law Realm!
The chance to learn a law from the Demon Race was an opportunity that was hard to come by. All he had to do was use his disruptive force and break this restriction boundary, releasing the Demon Old Sable from within. It was hardly anything difficult, but what would happen after he released him?
“The Law of Life is very good, but I still can’t accept it. The price is too high.”
Old Sable somewhat angrily barked, “What price? I’ve already seen you use that strange law you have. Though I have no clue what sort of law it is, it is definitely not something to be underestimated! As long as you cultivate it sufficiently, even the Law of Ternary Spectrum, a top-tier law power of the Light-type, can’t be a match for it. Let me out and kill me after. You can practically do all that with a lift of your small finger!
“Doing such a small act in exchange for the great Law of Life that belongs exclusively to the Demon Race—the price you’re paying isn’t high at all; rather, it’s insignificantly small!”
Xia Fei smiled upon hearing that, “First, you call yourself Old Sable, and there’s no way I can trust someone who isn’t willing to reveal his real name to me. Second, you already have an immortal body, and that means your cultivation is very high, meaning that I will still be lacking in cultivation if I go up against your enemies. On that point alone, I will be taking on severe consequences for letting you go. When that time comes, perhaps they’ll be the one having an easy time destroying my very soul.”
Old Sable was surprised. Xia Fei had indeed thought about the offer thoroughly and figured out the pros and cons from when they first met. That was the reason why he had not begged Old Sable from the get-go; he knew that if they were to make a deal, it would be a big undertaking, and the risk he must bear would be unprecedented.
Going by Xia Fei’s theory of price that he lived his life on, he would be willing to make a deal as long as it did not go against his personal principles, but the key had to be an equal transaction in terms of payment and reward.
Warriors were essentially a profession that lived their days with their heads tied to their waistbands, where living and dying was a daily part of life. Xia Fei was not afraid of dying, but he had no intention of courting death, either. Letting Old Sable go was evidently a deal that would cause him to lose his head. No matter how powerful a law could be, no matter how much money was offered, Xia Fei was not about to do something that would just result in him taking whatever benefits to his grave.
Old Sable heaved a long sigh. He had waited for millions of years before finally getting a chance at being reborn, meeting Xia Fei and his Law of Primal Chaos, but it just so happened that Xia Fei was a calm and obstinate person, not the sort who would lose his cool when tempted by potential benefits. Old Sable could not help but feel very dejected. Why was Xia Fei someone so headstrong?!
“My name’s Oro Wrej, a Black-armored War God of the Demon Race and the Supreme True Emperor of the Lionheart Clan,” Old Sable said. He knew that the titles he said did not mean anything in front of Xia Fei, so he did not bother hiding them from him.
Xia Fei was somewhat stunned. Black-armored War God? Supreme True Emperor?
These titles sounded very imposing, but Xia Fei did not show his surprise in the least. In this time, even if someone claimed to be a Tyrant King, the title itself proved nothing.
Oro extended a hand to take off his mask, and the ice casket he was encased in was too small for his frame, so he had quite a tough time before he managed to touch his face.
Shock!
Oro actually had a lion face! With his large nose and a mouth full of sharp fangs, his golden mane was dishevelled, looking far more stupefying than a real lion!
“The Lionheart Clan never reveals our true form to outsiders, so the fact that you’ve seen mine makes you a comrade of mine from here onward!” Oro declared in a deep voice.
Xia Fei did his best to endure the shock he was feeling. There were plenty of other sapient races out there, but this was the first time Xia Fei had heard or seen someone from a so-called Lionheart Clan. It was no wonder Oro wore an entire suit of black armor, covering himself so airtightly. It turned out that his true visage was this frightening!
A majestic lion that stood seventeen to eighteen meters tall! Just how scary would it be if such a huge head walked among the crowd?
“We of the Lionheart Clan act as we speak; let me out and I’ll give you eternal life!” said the Lionheart Emperor Oro decisively in a very dignified tone.
Xia Fei chuckled. “Eternal life? Don’t you mean never have a chance to experience rebirth? If I Iet you out, that is.”
“I can hand you the concealment technique, so no one could ever find any trace of you. No one will know where you go. Set me free.”
Xia Fei sighed, “That’s very tempting, but I’ll still have to say no.”
“If I kill you and you get reborn immediately, there’s no way for me to explain it when your enemies come after me, and who even knows if the concealment technique you’ll teach me actually works.”
The Lionheart Emperor Oro suddenly realized that convincing Xia Fei was truly a difficult task, and that the human would not fail to point out any potential flaw to the plan he proposed.
Phantom was curious. “If this Lionheart Emperor is so insistent on getting himself killed, even willing to offer the Law of Life just so he can die, why hasn’t he killed himself yet?”
Xia Fei laughed. “He probably will be more than happy to, but the physical body he inhabits has already been trained to the point where no matter how much effort Oro spends, he will have a tough time succeeding in killing himself.”
Phantom pouted. Becoming an immortal powerhouse sure was troublesome; unable to kill himself the moment he lost the cultivation to do so. It was really quite preposterous.
Getting up, Xia Fei made his way to leave the boundary.
The Lionheart Emperor Oro became flustered. “Where are you off to? Are you agreeing to this deal or not?”
Xia Fei answered, “I want to say yes, but I don’t want to be courting death, either.
“Since you’re not willing to tell me what those spiders are up to, I’ll have no choice but to see with my own eyes. Meanwhile, I can mull this over, see if I can find a perfect solution to this.”
With that, Xia Fei walked off. That great immortal war god was, thus, left alone with his sadness. Even his Law of Life could not grant him death!
No one would seek to die in this universe, and the tragedy that Oro faced was one where he could not even die even if he begged for it.
All those millions of years lying here in this desolate icy plains, Oro had practically lived a life no better than death, and he even began to somewhat regret cultivating to become an immortal.
Phantom could not help but ask, “Xia Fei, I don’t think that the huge lion was lying. You’ll hardly be the one losing out here if letting him go will allow you to obtain the Law of Life!”
Few would not be moved with the benefits right in front of them. Phantom had already been very much tempted by the conditions that the Lionheart Emperor had set. This was the Law of Life, after all! It was a supreme law that could practically extend life to last an eternity!
Xia Fei said, “Give it a bit more time. He’s already been stuck here for many, many years. He’s a lot more anxious than I am.”
Phantom suddenly realized that Xia Fei had decided to stifle the Lionheart Emperor Oro a bit more, meaning that he already had an idea in mind, or else he would not have spoken with such ease.
“Does that mean you’ve already decided?” Phantom was surprised. He had no idea how Xia Fei had managed to come to a balance between the dangers and benefits for this deal. There was no doubt that he would be hunted down if he let the Lionheart Emperor go, while failing to do so meant that there was no way he could learn the technique to become immortal. To say that the balance between these two options was elusive would hardly be an understatement!
“This thought has been on my mind for more than just a day or two, and the only reason why I haven’t explicitly offered it is that what’s offered isn’t high enough.”
Phantom was astonished. “He’s already offering the Law of Life; how is that not high enough? Xia Fei, aren’t you being a bit too black-hearted yet?”
Xia Fei smiled. “Thank you for the compliment.”
“It’s not a compliment,” Phantom muttered with mild annoyance.
“Whatever. I’m taking it as a compliment. Wait a while more and then I’ll let you know what’s true black-heartedness.”
Phantom was unimpressed. He knew Xia Fei’s thinking ability like the back of his hand, and he could not help but feel worried for the immortal war god, Lionheart Emperor Oro, lying inside that pyramid.
Truth had proven, time and again, that people whom Xia Fei ended up thinking about would more often than not end up miserable.
“Looking at you, I’m afraid that Lionheart Emperor Oro will be made poorer doing a deal with you,” Phantom said.
Xia Fei cracked a sinister smile. “Made poorer? Please, you’re underestimating me. He’ll more likely go broke.”
…
Leaving the boundary, Xia Fei was no longer smiling. Instead, he was serious, his eyes alert as he swept his gaze around the area, reaching out with his keen senses.
This was how he was. He would never go easy on anyone when fleecing somebody, not even letting a being of Oro’s stature off. When it was time for him to be serious, he would focus all his concentration on the matter at hand, not at all negligent in the slightest.
Carefully observing along the ice surface, he noticed that there was not even a single trace of any spiders for several hundreds of miles.
“Something’s not right!” Xia Fei blurted out in a low voice. “There were still tens of thousands of Ice Spiders two days ago, so there’s no way that they could all disappear overnight.”
All of a sudden, Xia Fei vigilantly squatted low and placed a hand on the icy surface as his expression turned grim.
“What happened?” Phantom asked in alarm.
Xia Fei placed a finger over his lips. “Quiet. There are tremors beneath the surface!”



Chapter-554-Spider-Empress
Chapter 554: Spider Empress 
Xia Fei keenly sensed light tremors coming from under the Eternal Ice Plains.
At present, he was over 600 miles away from the Law of Ternary Spectrum’s boundary. Xia Fei was a speed ability user, and such a distance was no more than a stone’s throw away for him, so he had inadvertently ventured too far out.
Knitting his eyebrows, Xia Fei climbed up the right side of an icy mountain, staying hidden by the mountainside as he curiously looked down at the plains below.
It was as if there’s something trying to burrow out from underneath,” Xia Fei said solemnly.
“Could it be a spider? Oro said that the Ice Spiders stay thousands of meters underground,” Phantom curiously asked.
Xia Fei shook his head. “Unclear. Let’s wait and see.”
The tremors were becoming greater, and several minutes later, even the mountain that Xia Fei was on had started shaking! It was as if an earthquake had erupted from out of nowhere!
*Rumble!*
The huge icy mountain split into two! A fissure from below surfaced!
Xia Fei lost his balance, but it was a good thing that he had not lost his balance because of the severe tremors. He hurriedly changed his liquid war armor’s form and used the four hooks that grew from his limbs to grip the icy surface tightly.
Furball suddenly lifted his head and glared into the distance; his eyes were filled with fighting intent, seemingly having sensed danger.
Xia Fei pressed on Furball’s head. “You don’t have to do anything. From today onward, all you’ll ever do is eat and sleep, becoming a proper glutton so that you can grow up quickly. Just focus on accumulating your energy; who knows when I may rely on your help one day.”
Furball pouted. The holy beast Shatterstar understood humans very well after spending so much time with Xia Fei, so he knew that being called a glutton was no compliment, and Furball was seemingly displeased with that.
*Boom!*
The plains abruptly exploded!
“A sinkhole! It’s a sinkhole!” Phantom exclaimed.
They saw a huge black hole appear across the once icy surface, over ten kilometers in diameter, and so deep that they could hardly make out its bottom!
*Roar!*
A strange cry could be heard coming from within, shocking the ears painfully of anyone within earshot!
Spider!
A gargantuan white spider came crawling out from the sinkhole, and it was letting out a series of frightening roars as if it were in great pain.
“Such a huge spider! Could it be the Spider Empress?!” Phantom’s expression was grim.
Xia Fei did not say a word. What he was concerned with was not the terrifying size of the spider but rather the figure on top of the spider!
Xia Fei had no idea how the Law Emperor, who had been hunting him down, Mu Qiubo, had actually managed to get himself on the head of the spider, half his body seemingly merged into the spider as if he were using some bio-fusion technique!
If Mu Qiubo truly had an ability to control these spiders and to control the Empress amid this swarm of spiders, then every Ice Spider in this place would without a doubt listen to him and become Xia Fei’s enemy!
Xia Fei was originally able to move about rather freely here in the ice plains because there were these Ice Spiders that would attack both Xia Fei and Mu Qiubo indiscriminately. Furthermore, Xia Fei was able to depend on his Crafty Approach to very nimbly shuttle among the Ice Spiders like fish in the water while keeping his distance from Mu Qiubo. The latter would have to first get rid of the spiders harassing him before he could reach Xia Fei, thereby slowing him down tremendously. By the time Mu Qiubo managed to kill his way to Xia Fei, the latter would already have been long gone.
Now that all the Ice Spiders were under Mu Qiubo’s control, that would come up to tens of thousands of evil creatures he would have to face! Xia Fei was severely at a disadvantage here!
That gigantic spider crawled out of the sinkhole, and right behind it was a mass of spotted spiders. They were small in size but moved very quickly, with colorful chitins.
In nature, a colorful palette did not just mean pretty; it also meant dangerous!
Just like the pretty and poisonous tree frogs, anyone who accidentally touched them would find themselves poisoned. They were very lethal!
These colorful spotted spiders were the same, but beyond just being poisonous to the touch, they were also capable of spitting poison!
Weird black and white spiders followed right after. Half black and half white split right down the middle, these spiders were big, with spikes growing out from their backs which made them resemble very much like an oversized hedgehog.
What followed after were just the normal Ice Spiders, and their numbers were the most, juxtaposed with their lowest status among them. The spotted spiders and black and white spiders would abuse these Ice Spiders from time to time, and the latter could only take this without any resistance.
“Heavens! Are… Are there a million spiders out here? Could that guy have sent every single spider alive on this planet?!” Phantom was in shock.
The endless sea of spiders swarming by the foot of the mountain made for a very fearsome sight. Xia Fei had no idea how Mu Qiubo did it, but he knew deep down that he would clearly be at an absolutely disadvantageous position from here on out, and there was no way he could effectively fight back.
Mu Qiubo’s cultivation was originally much higher than his, and now, after having gained command of this spider army, the power he wielded was horrifying!
‘Time to leave!’ Xia Fei thought to himself. As long as he could return to the Law of Ternary Spectrum’s boundary, no matter how powerful Mu Qiubo was or how many spiders were in his command, he would not have any way of targeting Xia Fei. As for what he could do afterward, Xia Fei decided to leave that conversation for later.
Just as Xia Fei was about to turn back to whence he came from, Furball suddenly let out a low growl. For some reason, Furball had already shown a strong dislike to these large white spiders from the beginning, treating them as his enemies, and inadvertently letting out a growl.
Furball was not particularly loud, but due to his penetrative power, even something hundreds of miles away could hear him as clear as day.
The spider swarm was deep in the fryer now. A roar from a holy beast was nothing simple, and though they were not the same species as Furball and did not fear him, they still could not help but get a little nervous. Even Mu Qiubo could hear Furball’s growl, and he turned his sharp eyes over to where Xia Fei was.
With a mirthlessly laugh, Mu Qiubo waved an arm and sent the thousands of spiders moving, surging right for the icy mountain Xia Fei was currently on!
The spiders all over the wild lands became like a huge army!
Without even having the time to scold Furball, Xia Fei began sprinting away. Furball had acted purely out of his bestial instinct, an expression of his strong desire to kill a strong foe and how he naturally intended to battle.
The spotted spiders were the fastest, though they were still far from being able to catch up to Xia Fei. The biggest threat actually came from those black and white spiders!
They were flat on the ground, their backs had sharp spikes which were like spears that could suddenly shoot out into the sky, raining down on the land like a perforating storm.
“Ranged attacks! Those spiders were actually able to attack from such a long range!” Xia Fei was very surprised to learn this. His body abruptly made an emergency turn, running in an oblique direction as he gained speed, all in an attempt to avoid the sharp spear-like spikes.
The gigantic white Ice Spider Empress let loose a bellow, and the surface of the ice around instantly turned sticky like glue, drowning half of Xia Fei’s foot as a result.
“Not good! This monster has a special ability; it’s capable of controlling ice!” Phantom exclaimed.
With the icy surface changed, Xia Fei experienced a massive decrease in his speed. Even if he devoted all his effort to running, he could only achieve 10% of his top speed, dropping down to 3000ms!
Speed was Xia Fei’s weapon, and it was also the basis by which he kept himself safe. There was no need to mention just how bad it was for him to see such a great drop in his speed.
Turning back to sneak a peek at the spider swarm chasing him, though their speed decreased as well, it was not as significant as Xia Fei’s. This was because they had eight legs, and each of them were slender and sharp. Even if they plunge into sticky liquid, they would still be able to maintain a higher speed.
The situation was hardly optimistic. Xia Fei was not only incapable of escaping from the creatures hunting him down right behind him, he also had to deal with the spikes that could come falling down from the sky at any time!
Soon, the agile spotted spiders caught up to Xia Fei. With lithe bodies and fine hair growing on their legs, they were able to float on the surface of liquid ice and advance at high speeds!
*Thup thup—*
Once near, these spotted spiders spat out gobs of black mist from their mandibles in an attempt to poison Xia Fei to death!
“Chain Blockade!”
These spiders were poisonous, so even though Xia Fei had the protection of the silvery liquid war armor, he had no intention of putting it up against the poison either. As he had no idea just how poisonous they were, keeping his distance proved to be the smartest option.
Five tornadoes whipped up, like a tropical storm that churned up behind Xia Fei!
These black mist not only failed to get anywhere near Xia Fei, they had actually gotten blown back!
These spotted spiders were unable to withstand the powerful spatial tears, and their bodies all got shredded into pieces by them!
A huge amount of poison got released, so much so that the poisonous mist turned the sky murky gray! The surface of the ice turned strange, like plenty of ash had fallen upon snow.
Xia Fei’s Chain Blockade technique was akin to tornadoes, carrying the poisonous remnants from the spotted spiders as they continued onward. The black and white spiders behind, which were attacking from range, did not have the resistance to poison like the spotted spiders, so they immediately began melting upon contamination, as if they had been assaulted with highly corrosive acid!
“So it’s a corrosive poison!” Xia Fei’s heart shuddered when he realized, secretly making the decision not to let any of these scary spotted spiders near him.
Through his ingenious counterattack, Xia Fei left the spider swarm behind him by several dozen miles, and he could already make out the boundary of the Law of Ternary Spectrum ahead.
As long as he was able to get within the zone, these spiders would all be rendered useless no matter their numbers.
“Crap! We’ve been surrounded!” Phantom yelled.
Xia Fei saw a sea of spiders swarming around the restriction boundary. It turned out that the spider army had divided themselves, with one harrying Xia Fei while the other had already circled around to block out Xia Fei’s intended escape route.
Without an advantage in speed, it would not be easy for him to carve out a path through the spiders!
The white Spider Empress had been left far behind. It most likely did not have much strength left to give chase because it had used its ability to affect the icy plains. Additionally, Mu Qiubo did not use any movement techniques to close in their distance because his body had been fused with the Spider Empress. Therefore, it was not easy for him to move with it.
The most powerful Spider Empress was with Mu Qiubo, and that was the advantage Xia Fei had, while the clear disadvantage was the million low-ranking spiders before him!
Gritting his teeth, Xia Fei circled to the northwest direction to get away from the swarming spiders in front of him, hoping to find a weak spot that he could attempt to blitz through.
Two fists would have a hard time taking on four foes; Xia Fei was not afraid of these Ice Spiders, but there was no way that he could deal with a million-strong spider army all at the same time! Retreat was the only option!
There were simply too many Ice Spiders, though, so the surrounding boundary was thronging with them. Xia Fei tried to penetrate into their ranks but failed. Instead, he ended up breathing in two lungs full of poisoned air! The cunning spotted spiders had used their poisonous mist around the boundary, making it so that Xia Fei had great trouble even if he tried to force his way in.
His lungs sustained light spasms of pain. His armor’s air purification system filtered out most of the poison particles, so Xia Fei hardly breathed in any poison. This bit was not too much a problem, but Xia Fei would be unable to withstand it if it was in larger doses. His rapidly pumping heart would promote faster circulation of blood in his body, and that allowed the poison to quickly get absorbed all over his body; Xia Fei had studied some medicine, so he understood the logic behind this.
Arching his eyebrow, Xia Fei firmly decided to abandon trying to get back behind the boundary and ran straight out toward the west!
No matter how powerful an ability was, it should not be able to affect the entire planet. As long as Xia Fei could get out of the Spider Empress’s range of control, he could find another opportunity to do battle!
Inside the restriction boundary, the Lionheart Emperor Oro sighed as he muttered to himself, “West? You might as well risk your life at breaking through the boundary; at least you’ll still have a shred of hope surviving.”



Chapter-555-Law-of-Fusion
Chapter 555: Law of Fusion 
Being chased by a million-strong army was a grueling experience, as this blinding sea of white spiders seemed endless. At this rate, Xia Fei would sooner or later tire himself out!
*Crunch*
Peacock Blue bound an Ice Spider which was slowly creeping in near Xia Fei, who subsequently dispatched it with a stab of his Blood Crystal, draining the blood essence of that huge spider dry.
Such a scene was rare, for rarely would just one or two spiders surround Xia Fei. He would more often find himself dealing with enemies that numbered in hundreds and thousands!
Heading toward the west, Xia Fei hardly had any time to think too much. The over a million spiders had already surpassed what Xia Fei could deal with. He needed to stretch the battle lines as much as possible, so that the army would trail, making it easier for him to divide and conquer!
This was the only method when facing a large number of enemies.
The spiders were of varying age, and the speed they had differed as well. Since they were moving at different speeds, the longer the distance they were made to travel, the more distinct this disparity would become. Only a small portion of spiders was capable of chasing after Xia Fei, and this pursuit would cause them to split off. Taking on just a few thousand spiders was nothing too scary, and Xia Fei’s tactic was slowly working as intended.
Xia Fei was presently retreating from the battle when he noticed that the icy plains in front of him had disappeared!
What was in its place was a lush rainforest, with very clearly defined lines between the ice and trees. On one side was summer, while the other was winter.
Xia Fei was very intrigued to find a planet that would have such a stark contrast when it came to environments. The dividing line between the two was no more than a meter or two in width, yet the climate in either was so different. Just what could be the reason for this?
Just as he stepped past the line, he could feel the temperature rapidly climb. His Silver Desert Armor’s ambient temperature reading was at 42 degrees Celsius, while it had displayed -40 degrees back in the icy plains. That was a difference of almost 70 degrees!
It was practically the difference between ice and fire!
The environment, the temperature, the terrain, the plants; everything was completely different, like two different worlds colliding together!
Those spiders that had chased Xia Fei up to the dividing line came to a halt, as if they were unwilling to take even a step into the tropical region. All of them gathered together and wiggled their heads, screeching at Xia Fei from time to time.
One of the Ice Spiders took a step closer, and it looked as if it suffered greatly when it came into contact with the humid climate. It cried and retreated to its icy world.
Without the ice beneath his feet, his speed had also returned to normal. With a light smile, Xia Fei plunged deep into the rainforest and disappeared without a trace in a matter of seconds!
…
About an hour later, Mu Qiubo arrived at the dividing line while riding the Spider Empress.
“Hmm? Why is this place different?” Mu Qiubo was puzzled by this as well. A single line cordoned the icy plains from the tropical region. The contrast was huge!
Seeing the spiders that had stopped right by the line, Mu Qiubo was enraged. He punched the Spider Empress harshly. “Command your underlings to pass through and continue hunting down that rascal! I must kill him!”
The Spider Empress shook its head, seemingly afraid of going against Mu Qiubo’s orders.
With his two glaring eyes, Mu Qiubo waved his arm and used law to force several Ice Spiders into entering the rainforest.
The Ice Spiders withstood the pain as they forcefully got up from the ground, trembling as they wanted to return to their icy paradise, but none of them dared to do anything when faced with Mu Qiubo’s fierce scowl.
“It’s just a little more humid; you won’t die as a result! I’ll let you off after I kill Xia Fei!”
Just being forceful with the powerful Spider Empress was not enough. Mu Qiubo did not fail to bait the creature accordingly. As the Spider Empress considered the proposition, the spider amassed in greater numbers behind it, forming a substantially powerful force to be reckoned with.
Xia Fei’s assumption had been spot on: Mu Qiubo had used a kind of law to control the Spider Empress.
After spending the past dozen and more days suffering, Mu Qiubo not only failed to kill Xia Fei but also actually witnessed the latter become stronger with each passing day.
It was evident that Xia Fei was much stronger than when he first arrived at the Eternal Ice Plains, his law cultivation soaring by three whole levels, such that he was no more than a step away from becoming a Law Sovereign!
Mu Qiubo had no clue how Xia Fei was able to grow so rapidly in his level, but he was certain that if he continued letting Xia Fei develop like this, there would come a day when even he would have trouble facing the young man!
Mu Qiubo was very envious and jealous that Xia Fei had the ability to use the Law of Primal Chaos to penetrate through spatial barriers. He was even more shocked when he saw him later use those weird blades of grass. He had no idea that it was the Immemorial Mystic Armament Peacock Blue, but from what he had known in his hundreds of years in the Law Realm, Mu Qiubo could vaguely sense the conspicuous plant’s prowess.
Then there were the bodies after bodies of dessicated Ice Spider husks, all looking like they had been drained dry of their blood essence by a vampire, turning into dust with a mere kick as if the very life in those creatures had been siphoned!
All these strange signs combined caused Mu Qiubo to deem Xia Fei as a very freakish and mysterious foe, and he had to think long and hard just to come up with a method to kill Xia Fei!
The Law of Ternary Spectrum’s restriction boundary was wondrous, and there was no trace of energy to it, yet it was able to prevent anything from entering. Even Mu Qiubo with his level 4 Law Emperor cultivation could hardly get anywhere near it.
Mu Qiubo was convinced that the reason why Xia Fe could become so powerful over time had a lot to do with what was inside the boundary. He wished he could just get through and find out what was within, but because he did not have Xia Fei’s Law of Primal Chaos, this was not something he could achieve.
If he managed to capture Xia Fei, perhaps he could learn how he did it, but Xia Fei was crafty, even more slippery than a loach in mud. Forget catching him, as he watched Xia Fei’s cultivation grow in the past couple of days, Mu Qiubo hardly even got any chance of getting anywhere near him.
The more he thought about this, the more depressed he felt. It was Xia Fei’s fault that they were trapped here in the Eternal Ice Plains. Moreover, he was deeply envious seeing the lad grow stronger with each passing day—a feeling that grew into jealousy then hate!
Around afternoon yesterday, Mu QIubo was enjoying being surrounded by the Ice Spiders behind his spatial barrier when a peculiar but colorful Ice Spider appeared from out of nowhere. Upon seeing the colorful spider, all the other Ice Spiders hurriedly duck to another side, as if they were very afraid of it.
Seeing this scene, Mu Qiubo suddenly remembered a minor law he had once learned: the Law of Fusion!
This minor law was a derivative of major and common laws. Different from how major laws were capable of great devastation when mastered, minor laws lacked such destructive power, though they would be greatly enhanced in certain aspects; if a Law Adept was able to integrate a minor law with a major law, it would result in a strengthened combat power!
Warriors in the Law Realm would attempt to cultivate some specialized minor laws aside from their major laws, as a supplementary ability.
The Law of Fusion was an offshoot from the Great Law of Matter and allowed two different species to fuse with each other. For example, fusing a dagger into an arm would allow a warrior to have a hand knife which was as strong and sturdy as metal. It could be used to fuse other biological creatures, and the only drawback to this law was that it could only fuse with either a single substance or living creature.
The sudden appearance of the higher grade colorful spider stunned Mu Qiubo. He suddenly realized that there was not just one species of Ice Spider, so if he could somehow capture the most powerful Ice Spider, perhaps even fuse with their Empress, that would mean gaining access to the ability of controlling all the Ice Spiders out here in the Eternal Ice Plains! It essentially meant that the million of spiders out here would all serve him!
The next day, Mu Qiubo ventured deep into the icy plains, searching for the most powerful Spider Empress as all the other spiders each retreated underground in an effort to protect their Empress. That was the reason why Xia Fei only saw an empty icy plain when he first left the boundary.
The situation became a lot simpler after. Once Mu Qiubo successfully fused with the Spider Empress, thereby gaining control of the million-strong spider army, he made them all hunt after Xia Fei the entire way until he got to this strange rainforest.
*Roar!*
The Spider Empress let out a screech, causing all the Ice Spiders to tremble when they heard it.
Mu Qiubo was pleased. His Law of Fusion had perfect control over the Spider Empress, making it obey everything he commanded.
“Let’s see how you’re gonna survive this time!” Mu Qiubo viciously hissed to himself.
The million of Ice Spiders crossed the dividing line in force, all in an effort to chase after Xia Fei.
Ice Spiders were organisms that lived in the Ice Plains, so of course they could not withstand a temperature up in the thirties. Before long, hundreds of them collapsed, no longer able to take even half a step forward.
Mu Qiubo frowned. He discovered that all the spiders were dependent on the Empress, because it possessed the chilling ice ability; the moisture in its immediate surroundings would turn into ice wherever it went, which greatly reduced the agony the Ice Spiders were experiencing in the humidity.
Mu Qiubo had a brainwave, and he used his Law of Space to erect a huge shield that prevented heat from penetrating while also keeping the cold air from seeping out. He then commanded the Spider Empress to focus on maintaining its ability, turning the entire space chilly.
As the temperature dropped down to -10 degrees, it was now at a range that the Ice Spiders were not used to but at least no longer struggling. This increased the speed of the Ice Spider army’s advancement quite a lot.
One or two exotic beasts could be seen amid the foliage from time to time, and they were all hungrily devoured by the Ice Spiders, so they could not become any threat.
‘Here on this planet, I am King!’ Mu Qiubo thought to himself, delighted.
Come evening, Mu Qiubo had led the Ice Spider army into an open valley. That was when the Spider Empress abruptly came to a halt, no longer willing to take another step forward, seemingly afraid of something.
“Fool! Call your underlings to carry on forward!” Mu Qiubo gave the Spider Empress two ferocious punches on its head, causing it to let out pained cries. Though it was an empress among the Ice Spiders, it was still no match for a Law Emperor.
That was when he heard a human voice from ahead.
“If I were you, I wouldn’t be abusing your mount like that.” Xia Fei was looking at Mu Qiubo from atop a mountain, a slight smile on his face.
On his shoulder was the holy beast Furball, and right beside him was also a giant condor, even larger than an elephant, looking right at Mu Qiubo with its cold and piercing gaze.
“Beast king?” Mu Qiubo was slightly taken aback. He had not seen that large condor beside Xia Fei before, and he had no clue where Xia Fei found it, either.
“You’re still only concerned with yourself even when you’re standing at death’s doors!” Mu Qiubo declared with great gusto, his mouth curling up to form a sinister smirk.
“Reveal the secret inside that colorful light boundary, or else I’ll let these Ice Spiders eat you alive!”
Xia Fei furrowed his brows. “What? You plan to suppress me with your numerical advantage?”
Mu Qiubo burst into boisterous laughter. He waved his two arms out as he pointed to the million-strong Ice Spider army he had brought along with him. “What can you do about it if I rely on my numerical advantage?”
Xia Fei gave a light nod.
All of a sudden, exotic beasts began flooding from both sides of the valley.
Their numbers went well beyond the amount of Ice Spiders that Mu Qiubo had brought along!
It was no wonder that the Spider Empress had been unwilling to take a step into the rainforest. It turned out that this rainforest was a habitat where exotic beasts congregated! There were countless exotic beasts living here!
Xia Fei happened to be someone who had cultivated the Beast Spirit Codex, and beside him was the unparalleled being, the Holy beast Shatterstar!
Seeing Mu Qiubo’s face turn from red and green to white, Xia Fei chuckled. “Didn’t you plan to suppress me with your numerical superiority? Looks like you don’t have enough underling to do that.”
*ROAR*
The roar from the millions of exotic beasts echoed throughout the sky!
The mass of Ice Spiders huddled close in despair, just like ants on a frying pan!



Chapter-556-A-Bloody-Battle-between-the-Exotic-Beasts-and-Ice-Spiders
Chapter 556: A Bloody Battle between the Exotic Beasts and Ice Spiders 
Even in Mu Qiubo’s wildest dreams, never did he imagine that, just as how he had been able to gather a million-strong Ice Spider army through his Law of Fusion, Xia Fei could also rely on the Beast Spirit Codex to achieve control of the exotic beasts in this entire rainforest!
Furthermore, their numbers were greater with even stronger combat strength and far more ferociousness!
On Xia Fei’s side stood powerful and mighty silhouetted figures one after another.
A rank 7 White-faced Greentooth Ape King!
A rank 8 Short-tail Red Crown Crocodile King!
A rank 6 Black Wooden-eyed Bear King!
A rank 7 Star-flared Sea Pearl Snake King!
A rank 7 Steelclaw Balewind Wolf King…
The eleven Supreme King-grade exotic beasts, which inhabited this rainforest, were all standing beside Xia Fei, at his beck and call!
Taking the lead was the apex rank 9 Austere Sculpted Demon Condor King!
There was also the King of beast kings, the Holy Beast that even God Beasts were terrified of, the Shatterstar! Such a line-up could be described as majestic! Comparable to an army that numbered in the tens of thousands!
His eyes turned cold as Xia Fei stood up on that mountain peak and called loudly, “Competing against me in numerical superiority? You can keep on daydreaming!”
Arrogance!
Such overbearing arrogance!
Mu Qiubo was infuriated. He knew very well that this rainforest was an exotic beast’s paradise! The high temperatures and humidity were fatal to the Ice Spiders, and given the clear disadvantage in numbers his side was now experiencing, it seemed like this would be an extremely difficult fight.
However, he simply could not understand just how Xia Fei, who had spent all his while fleeing from his Ice Spider army earlier, after running into this mysterious rainforest in such disastrous conditions, had managed to amass such a powerful army in the blink of an eye! Could there be some god helping Xia Fei from behind?!
Even a Law Emperor of his caliber could not pass through the restriction boundary of the Law of Ternary Spectrum, yet Xia Fei could come and go as he pleased. Over the span of these more than a dozen days, Mu Qiubo watched in bewilderment as Xia Fei grew from a middling Law Warrior to become a peak Law Warrior; such a rate of promotion was practically even faster than what deities could achieve!
The timeline for others to promote was measured in terms of years, requiring constant cultivation over months and years in order to forge their way ahead with grueling effort, but Xia Fei’s promotion was as pernicious as the will of the gods!
He would promote after disappearing for a few days! The best way to describe how he could promote so crazily was getting a complete makeover after a short period.
Then these millions of exotic beasts were now taking his command in earnest; Mu Qiubo was on the verge of losing his mind here! He even felt that Xia Fei was not human but a monster, instead!
With a bold wave of his arm, Xia Fei let out the signal for his counterattack!
Millions of exotic beasts came surging down from the surrounding mountain sides, snarling menacingly as they dove right for the ice spiders!
The ground trembled!
The power that these millions of exotic beasts put forth rivaled that of armageddon!
Wherever this beast army passed, the trees and vegetation would all get trampled underfoot! Hills and mountain inclines leveled! Rivers churned up and parted!
“Charge! Kill that wretch!” Xia Fei was enraged.
Beside him, the eleven Supreme Beast Kings joined in on this unprecedented war between exotic beast and ice spiders!
The skies!
The land!
The waters!
In every dark corner of the forest!
There were exotic beasts everywhere!
Their numbers were uncountable! So much so that they practically blot out the sky! Like an oppressive haze of dark clouds, a depressing sight as they descended upon the enemy!
Mu Qiubo paled. He reinforced his spatial barrier, hoping to rely on his law to resist the attacks from the exotic beasts!
“Chain Blockade!”
Five tornadoes appeared from thin air, clearing everything that stood in their way with frighteningly disruptive power!
*Kaboom!*
A loud explosion could be heard, and five huge tears were forcibly made across Mu Qiubo’s spatial barrier, and the ferocious beast army poured in under the lead of the beast kings!
This was no war but plain slaughter, instead!
The Ice Spiders had left their sub-zero icy plains and arrived at this humid rainforest, so of course none of them was as powerful as what they had been before. The Ice Spiders all scattered wildly when the beasts came to bear. Any that was too slow would end up being torn to shreds by the army of beasts!
A spotted spider attempted to release its poison, but several green snakes quickly came springing off from atop trees, sinking their fangs right on to its back!
The venomous snakes found in the rainforest were even more poisonous than the spotted spiders!
In barely a second, the spider was dead flat on the ground foaming at its mandibles!
This battle was completely one-sided, with Xia Fei’s exotic beast army holding the clear advantage with both their location and timing, as well as their numerical superiority! There was no way for the Ice Spiders to put up a fight!
In the span of several minutes, the frontlines had collapsed in on the spider’s formation and were soon reaching the Spider Empress with Mu Qiubo!
*ROAR*
The Spider Empress spat out a large amount of white mist, instantly dropping the temperature around it below zero, freezing several wolves that had charged toward it solid. The Ice Spiders around proceeded to use mandibles and claws in a flurry of attack, shattering these frozen statues and killing the exotic beasts within!
Xia Fei wrinkled his forehead. The exotic beast army was very strong, but they lacked any advantage when dealing with Mu Qiubo and the Spider Empress. After all, Mu Qiubo had a very high cultivation, able to create spatial tears with a wave of his hand, instantly cleaving dozens of exotic beasts in halves!
*Whoosh*
It was as if the eleven Supreme Beast Kings had previously discussed it with one another, for they each suddenly appeared before the Ice Spider Empress, while the rest of the lower-rank beasts got out from the fight and focused on clearing out the remaining spiders around.
Beast King versus Beast King!
The Austere Sculpted Demon Condor King let out a shrill screech from the air as it came swooping down, a blurred figure that came down like a flash of lightning!
*Boom!*
Its body, larger than an elephant, came colliding with the Spider Empress, staggering it, as its pair of steel talons sank deeply into the latter’s body!
*Crunch*
The Condor King flapped its wings, forcibly dragging out a large piece of flesh from the Spider Empress!
“Shriek!”
The Spider Empress let out an anguished shriek!
These beasts were really too vicious, moving in to attack now that the Spider Empress was injured!
The Black Wooden-eyed Bear King swung its paw and five deep gashes appeared on the Spider Empress’s body!
The Star-flared Sea Pearl Snake King sank in its two venomous fangs, injecting a large volume of poison into the Spider Empress!
Eleven Beast Kings, and eleven different attacks took turns landing on the Spider Empress. It was as if none of them would let up their attacks until the Spider Empress was reduced into a carcass!
The exotic beasts and the Ice Spiders were overlords of their respective regions, neither seeing eye to eye with each other all these years. Neither could withstand the different climate, which was why they could cohabitate in peace with each other. Now that the Ice Spiders had all descended upon the territory of the exotic beasts, there was no way that the latter would let them off easily!
This was exactly what it meant to take advantage of someone while they were sick. This was not just Xia Fei’s living philosophy but also an unchanging rule of the natural world!
Not a single one of these eleven Supreme Exotic Beast Kings were the benevolent sort; being vicious and cruel was more in line with their nature! Had it not been because Xia Fei and Furball were a bloodthirsty reaper that had grasped the Beast Spirit Codex and a mighty Holy Beast respectively, there was no way any of these Beast Kings would have taken orders from anyone aside from themselves.
The eleven Supreme Exotic Beast Kings all came pouncing, riddling the body of the over one kilometer wide Empress Spider with bite marks and gashes. It was a miracle that the Empress Spider did not just lose consciousness there and then!
“Screech!”
The white mist was released once more as the Spider Empress focused all its effort on unleashing her freezing mist!
The difference between the common exotic beasts and Beast Kings lie not just in their strength but their intelligence as well.
Seeing the situation was no good, these Beast Kings quickly dodged to the side, hiding in the forest as they waited for the next opportunity to strike.
*KABOOM*
The very ground churned!
It turned out that the Spider Empress had released the icy mist so as to make the exotic beasts retreat, creating a chance for it to escape!
Its huge claws were working like rapidly spinning car wheels. The Spider Empress was focused on fleeing, leaving a deep hole with every step it took.
“D*mn you! Don’t run! KILL HIM!”
Mu Qiubo was still putting up a helpless struggle even now; in order to kill Xia Fei, he had already ignored the reality of how he had forced the entire mass of Ice Spiders to the point of extinction, insisting on fighting with Xia Fei to the very end!
Unfortunately, his attacks had all been but evaded or mitigated by Xia Fei. Even a Law Emperor would be left helpless in the face of his super speed, his physical agility through Crafty Approach, and his disruptive Law of Primal Chaos all working in tandem.
Mu Qiubo could not harm Xia Fei, and it was hard for Xia Fei’s attacks to kill Mu Qiubo, either. After all, the defense a Law Emperor wielded was substantial, able to conjure up walls after walls of spatial barriers non-stop.
The Spider Empress completely ignored Mu Qiubo’s orders, recklessly fleeing away. Mu Qiubo had not perfectly mastered the Law of Fusion, so he was unable to have perfect control over it.
With their boss gone, the underling Ice Spiders were of course the one that ended up running out of luck.
Millions of exotic beasts encircled the Ice Spiders as they engaged in a wild massacre!
None of the Ice Spiders had the courage to mount any sort of resistance now that their empress was gone, and the million-strong Ice Spider army was completely vanquished in a span of just one hour!
Xia Fei and the still alive eleven Supreme Beast Kings chased along the Spider Empress’s route of escape, even throwing out attacks from time to time when they had the opportunity!
The rainforest was the home of these exotic beasts, and they were obviously very well versed in the terrain. Any mistake that the Spider Empress made as it fled would all end up in the Beast Kings taking a bite or two out of it.
As for the lower-rank exotic beasts, all of them had remained on the battlefield to clean up the strugglers. If he was killing, Xia Fei would of course kill all to extinction so that there would not be a single Ice Spider in the Eternal Ice Plains ever again! That was Xia Fei’s goal!
Furball stood proudly on Xia Fei’s shoulder, commanding these Beast Kings to fight, his demeanor extremely tyrannical and arrogant.
Furball was mad that Xia Fei had stopped him from joining in the fight, so all he could do was urge the Beast Kings in their assault. No matter how ferocious these Beast Kings were, none of them could stop trembling when faced against the holy beast Shatterstar, so not a single one dared to go against Furball’s orders.
*Boom!*
A Wildstorm punch struck the Spider Empress square on its abdomen, and the powerful punch force mixed with the Law of Primal Chaos exploded on its chitin! A huge chunk got blown following the punch, and its blood came gushing out!
Xia Fei and the eleven Beast Kings’ powerful assaults only made the Spider Empress skittered away even more.
Xia Fei was in no rush. With his speed and Crafty Approach keeping up with Mu Qiubo, it was clear that he held the upper hand. Since he had gained the assistance of these Beast Kings, it was only a matter of time before he killed off Mu Qiubo and the Spider Empress. He was not at all in a hurry to attack and take any unnecessary injuries from this.
Soon, the Spider Empress was forced to the base of a large mountain. Behind it was a 10,000-meter cliff, and there was nowhere else for it to retreat!
The eleven Beast Kings spread themselves out, fanning out so that the Spider Empress and Mu Qiubo were in the center, baring their fangs, threatening the two. They were ready to kill them all in one fell swoop by the edge of this cliff!
Xia Fei slowly approached, pulling out the Blood Crystal as he gripped it in his hand. Thinking that several minutes would be needed to drain the gargantuan Spider Empress completely, Xia Fei had only not succeeded due to Mu Qiubo’s intervention.
“Was it you who tampered with the spatial door’s coordinates, bringing us to this foreign space?” Mu Qiubo pointed at Xia Fei.
Xia Fei nodded. “It’s indeed me. What are you going to do about it?”
“Mu Fuping has no relations whatsoever with you; why are you helping her?!”
Xia Fei simply answered, “Well, that’s none of your business!”
Xia Fei could not be bothered with this man any longer. He was pondering on just how he could make him slowly use up his strength until he died!
Mu Qiubo burst into laughter as his eyes suddenly sharpened.
Facing the encirclement of Xia Fei and his eleven Beast Kings, Mu Qiubo knew that there was no way out, so he had made up his mind that, even in death, he would drag Xia Fei down with him!
“Advanced level Law of Fusion! Life Fusion technique!” Mu Qiubo bellowed. “I’ll let you know what’s true law force is!”
Drawing a circle in the air with both arms, a strange power surged!
Xia Fei backed away along with those Beast Kings because they could all feel a great threat being unleashed from within Mu Qiubo’s body!
Fusion!
*Crack*
The sound of the Spider Empress’s exoskeleton crunching was heard, and then it let out an agonizing scream!
The ultimate power of the Law of Fusion had been used, and it allowed a man to fuse with a monster, creating new life!
The originally bright sky shining above their head had suddenly turned overcast!



Chapter-557-Distress-Signal
Chapter 557: Distress Signal 
It was hard to describe the scene unfolding before his eyes with words. The Spider Empress’s body had turned skinny and sturdy, from a huge arachnid into a monster with four arms and four legs in a matter of minutes!
Mu Qiubo’s Law of Fusion had caused him to become one with the Ice Spider—a peculiar and ferocious monster!
“Wildstorm!”
Before they could fully fuse, Xia Fei delivered a series of heavy punches right at them!
It was clearly evident that the monster after this fusion would have the combat strength of both a Beast King and that of a Law Emperor, becoming much stronger than before. Xia Fei simply could not allow such a thing to happen!
*Whoosh!*
Peacock Blue came out from Xia Fei’s right arm, reaching fifty centimeters in length in the blink of an eye! Its blue grass blades fluttered in the air!
Like very agile tentacles, Peacock Blue gripped the monster’s two legs left and right.
“Get down!”
Xia Fei used all his strength to hold the monster down. Two of the four legs from the monster had been ripped off, leaving it with just two legs and four arms clutching the ground.
“What are you all waiting for?!” Xia Fei angrily spat, and all eleven Beast Kings went pouncing on it, aiming at the monster’s legs with their fangs and claws.
*Crunch*
Blood Crystal was stabbed into the monster’s leg!
As it participated in more battles, the Blood Crystal’s speed at which it drained blood became faster and faster. A lot of blood flowed into the Blood Crystal from the leg of the monster; it was like a pump—no, more like a blood pump!
“ROAR!”
The monstrous Mu Qiubo let out an agonizing wail as it thrashed about!
“What strength!”
Xia Fei’s eyebrows tightened. The monster fusion of Mu Qiubo and the Spider Empress was immensely strong, and it could already reach that of a Peak Law Emperor!
*Bang*
Xia Fei was sent flying, tumbling into the air for several hundred meters. He only came to a stop after smashing through several dozen sturdy trees!
Fortunately, he had the protection of the liquid war armor, Silver Desert, so while Xia Fei could feel a measure of ache all over his body, he was not particularly wounded.
The Beast Kings had all stopped their attacks and leaped away from their encirclement. By now, the Law of Fusion was already completed, and trying to get anywhere near the monstrous Mu Qiubo was already very dangerous!
“Ranged attack!”
Xia Fei shouted his order, and the Beast Kings all began unleashing their various ranged attacks!
Exotic beasts would more or less gain their abilities after reaching the Beast King grade, though their capabilities would vary and demonstrate different degrees of combat strength.
Xia Fei used his Chain Blockade martial arts technique once more!
Mu Qiubo raised a spatial barrier before him. Aside from Xia Fei’s Law of Primal Chaos, nothing else could penetrate that, which was why Xia Fei must first break the barrier before the Beast Kings’ attacks could score a hit on the enemy.
*Bang bang bang—*
Different special abilities were unleashed at the same time, and the pretty lights and effects created were akin to a super-size fireworks display, which exploded in front of the monstrous Mu Qiubo!
The glaring light show covered the sky, with the monster Mu Qiubo right in the middle of everything. It was clear that this wave of ranged attacks was very powerful!
Without the protection of the spatial barrier, Xia Fei felt that Mu Qiubo ought to be heavily injured if not killed outright after this wave of attack!
*Roar*
That was when something unexpected occurred!
Before the lights could fade, a black figure suddenly leaped!
This one leap cleared over five hundred meters!
*Smack*
With his four arms clutching the cliff, The fused Mu Qiobo rapidly climbed up the peak of the mountain!
Xia Fei was stunned!
The body of the Spider Empress originally spanned over a kilometer, and it could be described as a huge monstrosity.
However, after fusing with the Law Emperor Mu Qiubo, their combined body reached a height of around 150 meters, and his build was a lot smaller than before!
Sinuous muscle lines bulged. Even the most outstanding bodybuilder could only sigh if they laid eyes upon this monster. His originally pale skin had turned greyish, and there was even a black mark imprinted upon his forehead!
Getting rid of the previously heavy and cumbersome body, Mu Qiubo now had both agility and speed!
“TAKE ME UP!”
Xia Fei yelled, so the Austere Sculpted Demon Condor King spread both its wings and soared to the clouds. Xia Fei exerted force to his legs and leaped high, grabbing hold of the condor’s talons as it climbed!
*Whoosh—*
With great speed, Xia Fei was carried up tens of thousands of meters up in the air!
Letting go of the condor, Xia Fei sharply plummeted head-first to the valley!
“Xia Fei, have you gone insane!” Phantom exclaimed. Never had he expected that Xia Fei would actually attempt something so suicidal!
To fall head-first for tens of thousands of meters from this height, this was practically too desperate a move!
“Shut it!” Xia Fei retorted.
Mu Qiubo fled up the cliff in an attempt to escape. This was when he suddenly discovered a black dot from above drawing closer and closer!
“GRAWR!”
Mu Qiubo seemed to have lost his speech capabilities after his transformation, merely growling a lot at Xia Fei as he waved his arms.
With his head lowered like a dropped bomb, a stern expression on his face.
Seeing that he was no more than a thousand meters away from Mu Qiubo, Xia Fei suddenly reached out his two arms and unleashed his spatial tear martial arts technique, Chain Blockade!
Because he was plummeting to the ground, Chain Blockade was not traveling out horizontally but directly straight for Mu Qiubo’s head!
Kaboom!
Spatial barrier versus spatial tear!
Xia Fei’s attack power was originally a lot weaker than that of a Law Emperor, but Xia Fei’s attacks not only had the spatial tear force, it also had the disruptive power of the Law of Primal Chaos!
The barrier shattered!
The tearing force struck Mu Qiubo! The violent tornado did a number right to him, creating thousands upon thousands of cuts upon his body!
*ROAR*
When the tornado attack finally passed, Mu Qiubo was left wailing.
Before he finished his roars, Mu Qiubo suddenly found that Xia Fei still had another move behind the tornadoes, and it was a move that no one expected!
Xia Fei’s Silver Desert had wrapped around him tightly like a cocoon, glinting its metallic sheen as he crashed in like an accelerated ionized cannonball.
A short dagger poked out from the circular surface, and it was none other than Blood Crystal!
It turned out that Xia Fei was using body as a weapon in order to assail Mu Qiubo!
The squall, which came from Xia Fei’s Chain Blockade, had messed up Mu Qiubo’s vision, so by the time he saw Xia Fei, there were no more than fifty meters between them!
*Bang!*
This one strike landed right on Mu Qiubo’s shoulder. Blood Crystal immediately began working, draining copious amounts of blood from the Law Emperor, far more agonizing than the spatial tears from before!
Though it was just a small dagger, the power it had was unimaginable!
The edge of the blade slashed downward, as a large cut appeared across Mu Qiubo’s grayish skin.
In his panic, Mu Qiubo’s body cringed, and began falling down from the cliff.
He had originally escaped half way up the mountainside, but this series of attacks from Xia Fei caused him to fall down to the base once more.
*Kaboom*
The Beast Kings which had already been waiting for this moment unleashed another series of explosions!
Xia Fei kicked himself off with the help of the cliff wall, and he came hurtling out at an oblique angle, which also reduced the inertia of his fall, so he safely landed on the ground.
“Crafty Approach!”
Without a moment’s hesitation, Xia Fei closed in toward Mu Qiubo, instantly making the decision to engage in close quarters combat with him!
Xia Fei had determined, after a short observation of the situation, that although the Law of Fusion combined Mu Qiubo and the Spider Empress as one, increasing the strength and agility, his Law force was ultimately weakened!
Until now, Mu Qiubo had yet to deal a single ranged spatial attack, almost as if he had lost the ability to do so.
Any gains would be balanced with losses; his increase in physical strength must naturally result in other aspects of him to weaken.
*Swoosh*
Xia Fei began sprinting, following along the cliff wall as he climbed upward. With a single tap of his foot, Xia Fei flew toward where Mu Qiubo’s brain was.
The monster was big in size, so Blood Crystal needed plenty of time to drain his blood essence. That was why Xia Fei had decided to retrieve the blood and brain juices from him directly!
The disadvantages of not having blood flowing to the brain was obvious, and no sentient being or beast would become light-headed as a result, making it far more effective than draining Mu Qiubo’s blood essence from anywhere else on his body.
“Bind!”
Peacock Blue answered Xia Fei’s order and came growing out, like a fragile ribbon fluttering in the wind. It deftly wound itself around Mu Qiubo’s head, essentially blindfolding him. Peacock Blue had two blades of leaves, and the other twined out to cover his nose!
“Tighten! I want him wrapped to death!” Xia Fei bellowed.
Peacock Blue was very resilient, and it swiftly began tightening its hold. As such, not only was Mu Qiubo’s two eyes completely covered, unable to see a thing, even his nose was sealed, making it impossible for him to breathe!
*Shink*
Blood Crystal was stabbed right into Mu Qiubo’s scalp! The bloodsucking dagger began drawing out fresh blood from Mu Qiubo’s brain!
*Crack crack crack*
A series of pops could be heard from the skull. Peacock Blue was practically crushing Mu Qiubo’s skull, which showed just how much strength it possessed!
In an attempt to free himself, Mu Qiubo used his hand to slap his head in his fluster when, really, all it would likely result was just him injuring himself.
Xia Fei cleverly got Peacock Blue to let go, slipping behind Mu Qiubo in one smooth motion.
*Crunch*
That slap struck his own head, and the misfortune Mu Qiubo nearly killed himself with that one blow.
Now behind Mu Qiubo, Xia Fei reached close to his neck and Peacock Blue struck once more! Winding itself around his neck this time, the plant constricted with such force that it prevented him from breathing, causing Mu Qiubo’s face to turn green!
*Puchi*
Blood Crystal was thrust into Mu Qiubo’s carotid artery!
The brain and the neck were where blood gathered the most. Blood Crystal thirsted for fresh blood, so the speed at which it drained its victim was much faster than a normal attack!
Peacock Blue was like a rope, and Mu Qiubo became like a hanged man on a noose. Blood was being rapidly drained from him, so much so that his tongue lolled out, as an unpleasant scent wafted out.
Mu Qiubo tried to stop everything from happening amid his panic, wanting to tear off Peacock Blue, which had wound itself around his neck.
However, this was an Immemorial Mystic Armament! The toughest and most stubborn weed throughout the whole universe!
Even if Mu Qiubo had the cultivation of a Law Emperor, he was helpless against it. Peacock Blue wound itself tightly around his neck, and unless this weed died, it would never loosen its grip.
He was slowly losing consciousness, for Blood Crystal had heavily stemmed what blood was being pumped to the brain due to how fast and how much it was sucking away. Even if he turned into a monster now, Mu Qiubo would be unable to stop what was happening.
The Law of Fusion was originally quite powerful, but it was just too bad that the oversized form that the fused bodies had made it difficult for Mu Qiubo to deal with the physical agility of a Crafty Approach master like Xia Fei.
Like using a cannon to hit ants, no amount of power mattered if he ultimately failed to land a blow on Xia Fei. Not to mention the fact that Xia Fei still had the mysterious Law of Primal Chaos in his back pocket, so he was not particularly afraid of dealing with Mu Qiubo’s attacks.
As his vision dimmed, Mu Qiubo saw a figure, a figure hiding deep underneath the Eternal Ice Plains.
After fusing with the Spider Empress, Mu Qiubo also inherited its thoughts and memories, and that sleeping figure in the darkness was something Mu Qiubo felt very familiar and close to.
Without making a sound, this familiar figure seemed to be in the middle of a deep slumber, unaware of everything happening above ground.
“Roar!”
Mu Qiubo let out a mournful wail, and this sound penetrated the ground, until it reached this figure sleeping in darkness.
No. It was not a wail but rather a distress call!
Because after hearing this cry, that humongous black figure, several hundred thousands of meters underground, moved!



Chapter-558-Demonic-Pastel-Ice-Spider
Chapter 558: Demonic Pastel Ice Spider 
“Go and die!”
Xia Fei used Peacock Blue to constrict Mu Qiubo’s neck, while Blood Crystal was madly drawing out his blood essence.
Be it human or beast, the neck was where countless arteries and veins were located, and there was plenty of blood flowing through. Blood Crystal position was right across the aorta, and plenty of fresh blood was being drained every second, causing the dagger to turn even darker.
Mu Qiubo let out a low croak which traveled down deep into the earth. Upon hearing this sound, a monster sleeping deep underground suddenly moved. It began madly digging through the earth, rock, and ice, making a beeline for Xia Fei.
The Lionheart King Oro once warned Xia Fei that there was not just one monster living on this entire planet!
In the natural world, there was a male and a female. Aside from a Holy Beast that was like Furball, most living creatures would have both, and the Ice Spiders were of course the same!
The ground rumbled!
The eleven rainforest beast kings all retreated far away, their fear visible in their eyes. Even Xia Fei’s seemed to have turned solemn as well.
Like the vigorous shaking akin to a volcanic eruption, it was as if something was breaking through the planet’s crust!
Xia fei gritted his teeth, not at all relaxing his stranglehold over Mu Qiubo. It was similar to when the Spider Empress emerged from the depths, and Xia Fei guessed that there must be another monster about to appear, so he must first kill off Mu Qiubo no matter what!
*BOOM!*
The ground fissured! Fragmented rocks and dirt covered the skies, as a huge creature appeared from underneath the ground!
It was a monstrosity, which was over two kilometers wide, similar to a huge millstone, with a pink pastel shin across its carapace!
The Demonic Pastel Ice Spider!
This monster was the partner of the Spider Empress, a gigantic pink Ice Spider!
The Demonic Pastel Ice Spider leaped up, bringing with it a snow of pink! Just like a scatter of cherry blossoms, the temperature dropped to sub-zero levels!
“Roar!”
The Pastel Ice Spider let loose a long bellow, as the pink snow in the air suddenly froze and turned into icicles, interlaced together to form a web. A pink, ice web!
This web was large, and it covered an area of several dozens of kilometers. Be it Xia Fei or any of the Beast Kings, all were caught in it!
Several seconds later, the temperature within the web dropped below -60 degrees!
These Beast Kings, which were used to the humid rainforest, were suddenly in agony, shivering all over, but Mu Qiubo, who had transformed into an Ice Spider, was slowly coming alive in the cold!
The Demonic Pastel Ice Spider crooked its head toward Mu Qiubo. The Spider Empress’s form had changed and was different from what that huge spider remembered, and it even had a bit of human scent to it, which left the Pastel Ice Spider very confused.
However, the aura of the Spider Empress remained, so the Pastel Ice Spider very quickly recognized its partner. It also saw Xia Fei, who was presently beating its partner up.
*Boom*
A leg, which was the size of a huge claymore, shot out, aiming its sharp claw at Xia Fei. The sound of rushing wind stirred!
Xia Fei did not dare to take a direct attack from the Pastel Ice Spider, so he had no choice but to retract his Peacock Blue and Blood Crystal, dodging to the side!
“Crafty Approach!”
He did several somersaults in mid-air before safely landing on the ground, retreating behind a large tree.
“Another Ice Spider? Why is this guy pink? It looks to be even more powerful than the Spider Empress!” Phantom commented.
Xia Fei responded. “Half of Mu Qiubo’s blood essence has already been drained by the Blood Crystal, so I doubt that he’ll have much left to live. Our target will still be him. Once we slay him, we can retreat to the restriction boundary created by the Law of Ternary Spectrum, so who cares how powerful that strange pink spider is?”
He saw as the Demonic Pastel Ice Spider approached its partner and let out a series of anguished cries, seemingly ignoring Xia Fei and those rainforest Beast Kings. It appeared to be in a lot of pain that the Spider Empress was dying.
The life of Mu Qiubo, who was basically the Spider Empress, was slowly leaving him. A huge amount of blood was gushing out from his neck, with nothing that could stem its flow. He was most likely going to die very soon.
Xia Fei waved his hand, and the frustrated Beast Kings all spread out, waiting for the next opportunity to strike.
That was when something strange happened!
The eyes of the Spider Empress flashed a last sliver of life as it bit into the Demonic Pastel Ice Spider with its sharp mandibles, sinking it deeply into the body of the Demonic Pastel Ice Spider.
“Is it trying to cannibalize?” Phantom was puzzled.
Xia Fei was stunned. He discovered that the two huge Ice Spiders were starting to fuse together!
“D*mn it! It’s the Law of Fusion! Mu Qiubo can’t hold onto his life after fusing with the Spider Empress, so he’s now recklessly attempting to merge with the pink spider, instead! That d*mn Law is truly hard to deal with!” Xia Fei hissed.
Sure enough, the body of the two huge Ice Spiders were gradually becoming one, and it was shrinking smaller in size!
When Mu Qiubo stood upright again, his shape changed once more.
His back bulged like two humps, with two legs, six arms. Walking alone, he stood well over five hundred meters, and he looked more humanoid than before.
Mu Qiubo had already lost his sense of self after fusing with two Ice Spiders, completely becoming a monster. His irises had turned blood red, looking especially vicious and savage.
The Law of Fusion was very powerful, able to merge two completely different lives as one, but it was also very dangerous, only able to be used just once. This was because the original self would lose control after fusing two lives, which was the case for Mu Qiubo at present. What was really in control were the two Ice Spiders, while only the hatred that Mu Qiubo had toward Xia Fei remained!
The two Ice Spiders of course also hated Xia Fei, since practically all of the Ice Spiders that lived in the Eternal Ice Plains had been exterminated because of him!
*Kaboom*
After fusing, the first thing the monster did was attack Xia Fei!
Pink icicles were like metal knives which suddenly bloomed from underground, and the monsters’ icicle ability was much stronger after fusion!
“Crafty Approach!”
Xia Fei ducked to the left and right, evading every attack by using the trees as cover.
*Whoosh!*
A single icicle sprouted right in front, barely a meter away from him!
Xia Fei clearly avoided it, but he ended up being thrown several hundred meters away as a result of the huge impact!
“Argh! This monster also inherited Mu Qiubo’s law force, so its icicle ability is imbued with the powerful Law of Space!” Phantom exclaimed. It was evident that what had struck Xia Fei just then was not ice, but law force!
Twisting forcefully in the air, Xia Fei barely managed to regain his balance as he landed, a burning pain that throbbed on his chest.
The Silver Desert liquid war armor was very strong, able to defend physical attacks and reduce law attacks, but that attack moments ago was simply too sudden, and before Xia Fei could even gather his Law of Primal Chaos, he was already struck and lightly injured.
“Roar!”
The monster let out a powerful bellow as if it recognized Xia Fei. It seemed to recognize only him, for it ignored all other Beast Kings completely as it charged straight for Xia Fei.
Xia Fei’s speed ability and Crafty Approach made him very agile and fast, but there was no way he could defend himself from every angle because there was a chance for an icicle with law force to appear from the sky or underground anytime!
These icicles were sharpened in the front, looking very much like big bamboo shoots that could appear from every inconceivable place and attack him!
‘It can’t go on like this. The power of those icicles is too much. I need to engage in close combat!’ Xia Fei thought to himself.
Pushing himself off the ground, Xia Fei darted right to the monster. As long as he stuck close, those icicles would lose their effect. If the monster were to continue attacking like before despite being so close, the icicles would also end up hitting itself even as they hit Xia Fei!
Just as Xia Fei expected, the monster stopped creating icicles once he was in melee range and, instead, used his six pairs of sharp arms to attack!
*Whoosh!*
With arms like blades, the monster struck from above!
Xia Fei inexplicably leaned back sideways, using Crafty Approach to dodge the said attack and counterattack with a cut of his own!
*Clang!*
The sound of metal meeting metal rang about. Blood Crystal had actually failed to penetrate this monster’s defenses!
No matter how powerful this Blood Crystal was, Xia Fei had to first plunge it into the enemy’s body before it could work, and given that it was not that sharp in the first place, it completely depended on Xia Fei’s brute strength in order to penetrate the defenses and dig into the enemy’s body. This was also why Xia Fei did not really like it. For combat, using a blunt knife was a lot more difficult than that of a sharp one.
This monster had not only inherited the strength of Mu Qiubo’s Law of Space, it also gained the defense of the two Ice Spiders, so its body was like stainless steel, hard for Xia Fei’s Blood Crystal to stab in!
As such, Xia Fei was in trouble; he would be subjected to the icicle attacks if he were to stay far away from the monster, and while staying in melee range would avoid this, his Blood Crystal could not be of use, and depending on just his physical agility was difficult.
“Law of Primal Chaos!”
Xia Fei knew that the only thing he could depend on in this current situation was this mysterious disruptive power! He needed to break through his enemy’s defenses!
*Bang!*
His fist was like a hammer as it struck the monster’s body hard!
The surrounding outer layer of the spatial barrier got shattered, allowing Xia Fei to deliver his Blood Crystal to the monster’s fore!
“I still can’t get through!” Xia Fei was shocked!
Though he had managed to break past the spatial barrier, it was like the body of the monster had an ice armor around it, for a sturdy ice carapace blocked the Blood Crystal from making contact, unable to reach in sufficiently.
The defense of the ice spider before it had been strengthened was hardly this abnormal. Xia Fei just had to use the Law of Primal Chaos’s power to break the first layer of defense when it was just Mu Qiubo and the Spider Empress, and then his bloodsucking dagger could easily puncture the body. The fused monster now had two layers, with the first being the spatial barrier and the second that sturdy ice carapace. If Xia Fei wanted to hurt it, he would have to break both layers of defense at the same time!
The Law of Primal Chaos possessed miraculous strength, and the strength Xia Fei had was already much stronger than before, yet it still could not be deemed perfect.
When attacking, he needed to impart a small amount of the disruptive force in order to attain decent effect from his attack, and Xia Fei had never tried combining both the power of the Law of Space and The Law of Primal Chaos.
Combining laws was extremely difficult, and few could succeed in doing so.
Adding a law was not equivalent to combining. Just like using two fists at once to attack an enemy, two fists could strike the enemy at the same time, but they could not achieve the same strength. Both arms grew from his body, and the division of labor was different. Some people were used to using their right, while others were used to their left.
Combining laws required two laws which were characteristically different from each other to strike with the same power. It must be perfectly balanced, no more or less, so the feat was very difficult to accomplish.
Right now, the situation required Xia Fei to combine his Law of Space and Law of Primal Chaos or to make the latter the primary force and the former the auxiliary. Only such a disruptive force was enough to shatter the spatial barrier and then break the second layer of defense, making a path for the fatal Blood Crystal to be sent in.
This was easier said than done. There was no one to instruct Xia Fei, and he could only rely on what little he had comprehended of the Law of Primal Chaos to make sense of things. His desire to make the Law of Primal Chaos his primary attack method was very difficult, and wanting to combine the Law of Space and the Law of Primal Chaos was even harder!
Presently, it was still Mu Qiubo’s Law of Fusion that held the upper hand, merging the benefits of a Law Emperor and two huge ice spiders together into one body. Though he ended up losing his sense of self, he also ended up creating a whole new monstrosity which had insanely tough defenses!
In this battle between the Law of Fusion and the Law of Primal Chaos, Xia Fei began to feel that he lacked the power to achieve what he wanted.

Chapter 559: Falling Leaf Palm 
In this battle between the Law of Fusion and the Law of Primal Chaos, Xia Fei slowly began to feel that he lacked the power to achieve what he wanted.
The battle between man and monster continued, and Xia Fei relied on his speed and nimble physical agility to fight. Even when he was going up against the Demon Chrysalis before, Xia Fei did not have such a tough time like today.
The spatial barrier of the Demon Chrysalis was much thinner, and Xia Fei was able to strike it again and again with the disruptive power of the Law of Primal Chaos together with his Wildstorm fist technique, until he shattered its defenses completely.
However, against this monster, Xia Fei needed to mount a strenuous assault.
The power of his attack at full force was great, but it had a slower rate of being dished out; by the time Xia Fei gathered the Law of Primal Chaos for the second strike, the spatial barrier of the monster had already regenerated, so Xia Fei’s repeated strike could go through the first layer but he was unable to injure the monster.
Tightening his brows, Xia Fei realized the predicament he was in. There were only two paths for him to take; he could escape back into the Law of the Ternary Spectrum’s restriction boundary and give up on killing his enemy or continue this stalemate.
Giving his enemy the chance to take a breather? Any experienced warrior would not do that. The monster was not in its peak state at the moment, so once it recovered, Xia Fei would probably have to pay an even higher price just to kill it!
Enemies must die!
Xia Fei’s maniacal mentality reared its head once more. Even though Xia Fei felt helpless dealing with the monster right now, he could only persist, not at all considering backing down.
If a day was not enough to kill this, then he would take a year! The point was that he would not let an enemy off!
The battle waged on as time flew by. In the blink of an eye, twenty-four hours had passed, and the state of the fight was still the same as before.
This was the fight between the Law of Primal Chaos and the Law of Fusion, and it was also a contest between their stamina!
Whoever succeeded in enduring until the end would be victorious!
Xia Fei’s energy was being rapidly used up due to his repeated use of the Law of Primal Chaos, needing him to rely on plenty of Origin Crystals to recharge. He had used up to a thousand grade 3 Origin Crystals in the span of the twenty-four hours of fighting!
The monster was getting more and more irritated, becoming more and more impatient, while Xia Fei was becoming filled with glee.
He realized that overusing the Law of Primal Chaos enabled him to increase his control of it greatly, and it was as if he was improving during the battle, gaining new insights every minute that he fought.
That indistinct power of his was gradually becoming clearer, as if a galaxy in countercurrent was swirling in his seventh brain region.
Xia Fei had always been adding just a bit of the power from the Law of Primal Chaos to his attacks, and without the guidance of an expert, trying to master a law was very difficult, not to mention that this was an overwhelmingly powerful law.
Though Xia Fei had managed to raise the Law of Primal Chaos to level 2 through sheer hard work, this increase in level did not mean that he had a complete grasp of its power.
Trying to make the Law of Primal Chaos as his dominant law and exerting the full power of its disruptive force was extremely grueling, and the first problem he faced was his lack of any martial arts technique.
Martial arts technique was not merely a skill used in combat but also the aptitude in maximizing the power of the law.
Take the Chain Blockade martial arts technique that Xia Fei often used; it would naturally draw the law force found in his brain when unleashed during battle, and the central the attack skill he used, the higher his cultivation of the relevant law, and the more powerful the martial arts technique would become.
Xia Fei barely had to do much work, since the martial arts technique and the law would automatically complement each other when used.
However, the Law of Primal Chaos was different. It was a type of force that existed in his brain. Just like a brawny man who had not studied martial arts, there was no doubt that he had strength, and no normal person would be able to beat him.
However, the moment such a brawny man matchup against an expert with martial arts experience, even if the expert could not hold a candle to the brawny man in terms of strength, he would still emerge victorious since that decides the victory, beside experience and strength, was technique!
This was the situation that Xia Fei was in right now. Just having strength alone but unable to maximize its fullest potential. As the fighting grew, Xia Fei had even greater control over his Law of Primal Chaos, but his technique with it was still stagnant.
*Bang!*
Xia Fei threw a fist out, attempting to use his palm and flip, all in hopes of finding a way to utilize the Law of Primal Chaos.
‘That effect’s not bad; let’s go again!’
He was slowly finding a foothold in his exploration of the Law of Primal Chaos. Xia Fei entered a trance in his research toward the principle of the Law of Primal Chaos, as well as how he could unleash the law force in his brain in an appropriate manner.
Phantom of course could sense these all, too. He was somewhat stunned, no longer continuing to nag at him to avoid disturbing Xia Fei’s clarity.
It was evident that Xia Fei was trying something new, a self-created technique!
It must be mentioned that what was known as martial arts techniques were essentially the fruits of labor of top masters’ unending research. These Law Adepts with profound cultivation would spend years thinking about how best to maximize their law force to their greatest potential, and it was nothing as simple as coming up with stances and postures.
Xia Fei barely had spent more than a handful of days learning law, yet he actually wanted to create his own technique?
Phantom would have already ridiculed anyone else if they made such an attempt, but Xia Fei was different. Phantom knew Xia Fei’s foundation very well and how he could change the impossible into possible. This was something that he had always done.
*Whoosh*
The monster’s sharp claws swung near Xia Fei’s body and sank into the ground, barely injuring Xia Fei. Since Xia Fei had devoted all his focus on studying the Law of Primal Chaos, the fight was becoming even more hair-raising. The same situation would keep appearing every time.
‘Just what sort of power is it?’ Xia Fei pondered to himself.
Like its name, the Law of Primal Chaos’s power was very chaotic and very murky. It was completely different from the Law of Space as its comprehension was open. By guiding its force through the meridians of the body, it was capable of tearing apart the very space itself!
Murky and obscure, seemingly invisible. Xia Fei expended countless brain cells just trying to understand the Law of Primal Chaos.
It was clear that the power existed, and its law force was stored in Xia Fei’s seventh brain region, but this power was very illogical!
Xia Fei attempted to draw it out via his moves, but no matter how hard Xia Fei tried, the power just remained in his seventh brain region, not at all willing to come out. Like a chaotic fog, Xia Fei could only control a minute amount of chaotic law force from when he first learned it until now.
This was when Xia Fei’s inhuman patience began to show itself, his intransigence toward giving up allowed Xia Fei to try and try again and again.
As long as it was a possibility that he could come up with, Xia Fei would try it.
First he tried guiding it, but this disruptive law force ignored him.
Next he tried dominating it, but this disruptive force refused to bend to his will; instead, it put up a fierce resistance,nearly causing his brain region to suffer a second heavy injury.
Law force was born, nurtured, and resided in the seventh brain region. This mysterious and small space actually gathered plenty of functions within, and anyone could not help but have plenty of emotions toward it.
Xia Fei had a 100% open brain region, and after cultivating two different special abilities and two kinds of law, his seventh brain region was still a vast empty space. The Law of Primal Chaos was like a mischievous child who was playing hide-and-seek with him inwardly, running about, leaving him completely helpless to its whims.
Having a 100% open brain region ought to be something that all warriors should be envious about, but to him, it had instead become a burden. This overly vast region of his brain made it difficult for Xia Fei to control.
Obsessed, Xia Fei concentrated on his brain region, while his physical body relied on his innate reflex. Fortunately, Xia Fei’s Crafty Approach had already been cultivated to the point where it was deeply rooted and inseparable to him. Against the monster’s continuous assault, he was able to barely keep himself alive.
This danger was not lost on these Beast Kings and Furball. All of them watched with bated breath, which went to show just how perilous the situation was.
This was not to say that Xia Fei had let his obstinacy get the better of him, but that Xia Fei was intentionally doing this.
During a battle, fighting by the skin of his teeth and dancing on a razor’s edge helped fire up a warrior’s potential. Xia Fei had intentionally put himself in harm’s way, all for the sake of that final sublime breakout!
If one did not die when faced with danger, then they could have explosive and spectacular achievements! Xia Fei was just that sort of maniac!
Recalling every time he used the Law of Primal Chaos, searching for the crux within, Xia Fei’s physical self danced with the devil as his mind began to analyze and contemplate carefully.
‘This can’t go on.’ was what Xia Fei told himself.
The Law of Primal Chaos was clearly a power that was so great it defied logic and the heavens. There must definitely be a way to use it!
Even if he could not unleash its full power, he must find the crux of it!
Xia Fei could not emerge victorious from merely using that bit of its disruptive force. The universe was vast, with plenty of enemies abound. There was no telling when he would come across an unimaginably powerful foe, and being unable to defeat this monster today was Xia Fei’s first warning. It was a warning of how merciless the nature of the universe was.
‘Since the Law of Primal Chaos is a disruptive power, why don’t I subvert my inherent form of thinking?’ Xia Fei thought to himself.
That was when Xia Fei felt an idea come to him.
Attack was a way to force his strength toward the enemy and unleash his power to strike down the enemy.
Since the Law of Primal Chaos was a power that subverted and disrupted, its use must also be a break from the conventional!
His palm lightly shot forth—a soft move that had no strength behind it.
*Bang!*
A miracle happened!
That seemingly soft and strengthless blow actually created an inexplicable effect!
The spatial barrier of that monster shattered instantly!
*Kaboom!*
The monster staggered. Xia Fei’s soft palm strike actually pushed it several dozen meters back!
It should be made known that this was a gigantic monster which weighed in the tens of thousands of tons!
A soft palm could actually make it stagger several dozen meters back? Just what sort of power was needed to achieve that?!
“Xia Fei, you succeeded! That’s the true Law of Primal Chaos!” Phantom exclaimed.
Xia Fei was very astonished with himself as well. He had just discovered the profound subtlety to the Law of Primal Chaos. It turned out that the more he wanted to use the disruptive force, the more it would resist. Thus, when he attempted to use a weak strike, that chaotic force instead heeded his call!
Furball and the eleven beast kings of the rainforest were all shocked!
Xia Fei had actually gotten into a very precarious state in his fight with the monstrosity, and it looked like he was about to be defeated.
It was at that moment when he was in the utmost danger that Xia Fei actually unleashed a completely brand-new power, and every blow heavily struck the monsters!
Forget that the seemingly light attack of his seemed like even a fly could not be struck dead; anyone who underestimated it by any account would most definitely receive the heaviest of blows!
*Smack smack smack smack!*
His palm made contact with the monster’s body like falling leaves. That savage monster, which was a fusion of a Law Emperor and two humungous ice spiders, became no more than putty in Xia Fei’s hand, letting him slap it around. This was a complete 180 turn to the scene moments ago!
Standing about a hundred meters apart, the monster panted heavily. It looked at Xia Fei with rage-filled eyes, its vision completely filled with panic and unease.
A torrential rain suddenly whipped up which covered the entire rainforest.
In this heavy downpour, Xia Fei arched his brow, giving off the look of an expert.
With the haze from before gone, the time for him to turn the tables was now!
“Great palm technique! Give it a name! After all, you’re the one who came up with it.” Phantom cheered in his elation.
“I’ll call it Falling Leaf, then,” Xia Fei answered softly.

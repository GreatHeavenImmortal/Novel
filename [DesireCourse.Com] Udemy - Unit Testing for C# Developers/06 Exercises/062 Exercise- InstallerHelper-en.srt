1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Alright, time for another exercise.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So, back in the Mocking folder, look at this class.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
InstallerHelper. This is the

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
code that one of my students sent me. So if you are that person who sent me this

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
code, thank you very much for sharing your code, we're going to use this as an example of a

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
code that touches an external resource. So here we have this method,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
DownloadInstaller. It takes a customer name, and

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
InstallerName, and uses the WebClient class,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to download the file from the internet. The first

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
argument to this method is the location, or the URL of this

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
file. So here we're using string.format to construct a URL

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
like this. example.com. The first argument after that

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
is customerName, and the second is installerName.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And this is the second argument to this download file

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
method. And this argument specifies the location on the

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
file system where we need to store this file. As you can see,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
the call to download file is wrapped inside

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
a try cash block, so if everything goes well, you're going to

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
return true, otherwise we're going to return false.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So, now, I want you to use what you have learned in this section, and write

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
a required unit test for this class. Next, we're going to look at my

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
solution.

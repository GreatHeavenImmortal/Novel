CHAPTER-1
1 Chapter 1 Hundredfold Comprehension

";Martial Arts are the future, and power is the guardian.";
";If you want to protect Blue Star and our home, you must strive to improve, sweat the last drop, and expend the last bit of heat.";
";There are only seven days left before Martial Arts College Entrance Exam. As the saying goes, grinding an axe on the eve of battle is not fast enough, let alone you still have seven days. Use these seven days as if they were seven years.";
";If you fail the Martial Exam, you can only take the Literary Exam. Think about it, when your classmates glow around the world, when they enter the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds, when they roam the cosmos, when they achieve immortality, you are still working overtime and worrying about food, salt, and tea ";
Jiang Ming was still lost in thought, but the head teacher's impassioned scene of waving his fists and spittle flying around before school dismissal echoed in his mind.
He had transmigrated.
After absorbing the memories, he was shocked.
This was an ultra-modern world, but martial arts were popular and practiced by everyone.
There were powerful martial artists who opened up pocket worlds and transformed stars.
There were powerful martial artists who entered the Ten Thousand Realms Battlefield to conquer the universe.
And so on.
It was incredible.
Take the college entrance exam, for example, which was divided into Martial Exam and Literary Exam.
The Martial Exam came first, and the Literary Exam came second. If you failed the Martial Exam, you could only take the Literary Exam and become just another cog in the wheel of society.
Martial Exam was also a national carnival, because it was broadcast live on TV, and the city top scorers, province top scorers, and federal top scorers were determined.
Not to mention becoming the world's only Federal Champion, just becoming a City Champion was enough to skyrocket one's career.
";Hehe, Ming, the big white legs, right?"; Wang Fatty laughed beside him.
";Big white legs?"; Jiang Ming couldn't help but be surprised. He looked at the virtual screen in front of a foot-washing city, where a big white leg was advertising: During the Martial Exam, the discount is 50%; for the first 100 students, it's free for one month.
";Hehe, that's a man's dream. Ming, work hard to be within the top 100 in the city, and enjoy yourself at that time."; Fatty winked, ";Do you want me to take you to try it now? Get familiar with the routine first?";
";Get lost, I have to save my virginity for my future wife!";
";Come on! Men, who doesn't know who!";
The two were desk mates and good friends.
At the intersection, the two parted ways.
";Ming, are you going tomorrow?";
";No, I'll practice at home!";
";Keep it up!";
";Keep it up!";
Jiang Ming walked silently.
According to his memory, he' had average talent in martial arts, only considered average in the class. After practicing for so many years, he still hadn't reached the state of Muscle and Bone Resonance.
Even if he participated in the Martial Exam, he could only enter an ordinary martial arts school.
Jiang Ming scratched his head, but at this moment, a prompt sounded in his mind.
";Ding: System activated.";
";Ding: Talent loading";
";Ding: Talent loading completed.";
";Ding: The Martial Arts Talent System is fully activated. It is detected that the host is currently in the Martial Arts First Layer realm, temporarily solidifying the Hundredfold Comprehension' talent.";
";Ding: Step into the Martial Arts Second Realm within seven days, and the temporary talent will be permanently solidified; otherwise, the talent will disappear!";
";Ding: Temporary talent solidification in progress.";
";Ding: Solidification completed!";
Jiang Ming was stunned, and a barrage of information rushed at him. At the same time, he felt his soul as if it had been cleansed of dust. In an instant, the world in front of him seemed to become a hundred times clearer.
His thoughts raced, and all the memories of his previous life and even past life surfaced in his heart.
His mind seemed to have left his body, merged with heaven and earth, and gained insight into the essence of the world and the mystery of the void.
";This ";
Jiang Ming was astonished and then overjoyed.
";Is this the legendary benefit for transmigrators!";
He took a deep breath, suppressed the waves in his heart, and carefully sorted through the information.
This was the Martial Arts Talent System, and every time he entered a realm, he would be given a temporary talent and a limited-time mission.
Only by completing the mission would the talent be permanently solidified and become his genuine ability.
";Talent should be innate, born from bloodlines. But now it's been granted. I must be defying the heavens.";
Jiang Ming leaned against the wall and pondered.
He had a detailed understanding of Hundredfold Comprehension  it was the ability to comprehend cultivation skills, with anything being a hundred times more effective.
Moreover, it also granted him a photographic memory.
";Hundredfold Comprehension is equivalent to greatly enhancing my understanding, logic, reasoning abilities, and so on. But now I need to undergo body refinement, and reach the next realm in seven days. It's not going to be easy!";
The first layer of Martial Arts is the Bone Forging Realm. There is no specific strength requirement. Simply put, one needs to temper one's body, then force the strength into the bones. When the bones have a tingling sensation and the muscles and bones resonate, this would be considered great success in bone forging.
Going further, one needs to integrate the strength, twisting it into one, mastering it like an extension of one's arm. In short, this means refining the strength and achieving perfection.
Once one reaches this level, one needs to sense the Heaven and Earth, draw Qi into the body, and open the Dantian sea of Qi. This is the second realm of Martial Arts, the Qi Sea Realm.
Jiang Ming didn't think too much, and quickly headed home.
He lived in Jinhua Community, which was very ordinary.
Arriving at the third floor, he opened the door and walked into the apartment. It had three rooms and a living room – not small, but very quiet.
He let out an inexplicable sigh.
He was the only one living in the home now.
He took a quick look around, then sat down on the sofa, considering his next arrangement.
Stepping into the second realm of martial arts within seven days, although the chances were slim, he decided to give it his all. If he succeeded, just the permanent solidification of the Hundredfold Comprehension talent alone would make his martial arts path go smoothly and ease his life.
";To temper the body, cultivate Qi and blood, and forge muscles and bones, I need proper nutrition, meaning I need money!";
";Additionally, I need a cultivation method!";
Jiang Ming thought about it, and a screen also appeared before his eyes.
Name: Jiang Ming
Cultivation level: Bone Forging Realm (Martial Arts First Layer)
Cultivation Skills: Soft Fist, Military Boxing, Shock Fist, Thunderstorm Nine Slashes
Talent: Hundredfold Comprehension (Temporary Solidification)
Mission: Break through to the second realm of martial arts within seven days
The information was simple.
Thunderstorm Nine Slashes was a blade technique and also a killing technique.
The martial exam inevitably included combat assessment. His predecessor' had only just managed minor success.
Soft Fist was a body tempering method taught since elementary school. It was meant for the general population – simple and easy to learn, without causing bodily harm. However, its body tempering effect was much worse.
It was a foundational method.
In high school, students were taught Military Boxing, a cultivation method suitable for widespread promotion among the general population. But it was extremely domineering, and if practiced improperly, could easily harm their body, which is why it was introduced at the high school stage.
High school students had abundant Qi and blood, well-developed physique, and strong comprehension, making it more suitable than ever.
As for Shock Fist? This was a deeper body refinement method, and difficult to learn at the entry level. However, once practiced successfully, its body refinement effect was excellent.
Apart from Soft Fist and Military Boxing, high school students also have the right to choose one additional method to practice.
The vast majority of students choose this method, but ultimately, few can enter it; most stick to Military Boxing.
Cultivation methods are divided into entering, minor success, great success, and perfection.
According to the memories of his predecessor,' Soft Fist had been practiced to the stage of great success, while Military Boxing had only reached minor success.
Jiang Ming pondered, and the content of Soft Fist emerged in his mind. After thinking it through and refining it slightly, he understood its essence.
He stood up, took a stance, and began practicing.
Soft Fist was named for its softness,' like water. Water is the softest thing and has the good quality of flowing into everything.
Water benefits all things without competing, nourishing all things in silence and being soft and pliable.
One pass integrated the predecessor's' cultivation achievements; two passes fully mastered the great success practice; three passes, subtle movements, pinpoint strength, understanding its essence, perfectly interpreting the essence of Soft Fist.
His body trembled slightly, and a surge of strength emerged from deep within his body, circulated throughout his body, and then subsided.
He felt an increase in strength.
";Is this the horror of the Hundredfold Comprehension?";
Jiang Ming was shocked and then showed a smile.
At the same time, he thought of another point.
";When practicing Soft Fist to the state of perfection, it will trigger one's potential once, and it turns out to be true!";
He exhaled a turbid breath, and felt a bit more relaxed.


CHAPTER-2
2 Chapter 2: Perfection Once Again

After practicing Soft Fist a few more times, the improvement was minimal.
";This fist technique is only for building a foundation and promoting vigorous blood and qi circulation!";
Jiang Ming shook his head, sat down for a drink of water, and began to delve into the essence of Military Boxing.
In his mind, it seemed as if countless tiny figures were practicing boxing and comparing it with his previous life's cultivation experience, pondering every movement and variation, and unraveling the mysteries behind each move and form.
As the figures dwindled, they eventually merged into one.
Jiang Ming opened his eyes, now enlightened.
";Military Boxing is all about dominance. The techniques are simple and efficient, heavy and powerful. Practicing it not only hones one's character but also forges unwavering confidence.";
He stood up, moved to the center of the living room, and assumed the stance once more.
";My teacher once said that whether it's Soft Fist, Military Boxing, or Shock Fist, mastering them to the realm of perfection will trigger a Cleansing Marrow process. This is the profound wisdom and truth contained in these techniques, which is why they are widely promoted, and it is also my hope.";
With steady steps and whistling fists, he performed the moves.
Once finished, he had fully grasped the Minor Success level of Military Boxing.
Jiang Ming didn't stop.
He continued, his boxing like a ferocious tiger descending the mountain and a never-ending torrential river.
After three more sessions.
";I've reached the Great Success level!";
";I can feel tingling in my bones too!";
Jiang Ming stopped and revealed a delighted expression, but then he rubbed his belly.
He was hungry.
Cultivation improvement came from food.
Without enough food, even the best comprehension would be useless.
Opening the refrigerator, he found a pork knuckle and a few cans of meat, which he heated up in the microwave.
While waiting, he checked his phone and saw a balance of 180,000 credit points.
";I wonder if it'll be enough?";
By the time he finished his drink, the food was heated. He feasted, then ate an apple and drank two more cups of water.
After a brief rest, he resumed cultivation.
As the lights turned on and night fell, a peculiar force shook Jiang Ming's body, turned into a warm current, and permeated his limbs and bones, refining his physique and strengthening his body.
Having achieved perfection in Military Boxing, the Cleansing Marrow was triggered again, this time several times more potent than reaching perfection in Soft Fist.
The tingling sensation in his bones intensified, covering his entire body.
Jiang Ming didn't stop, continuing to practice Military Boxing.
Each session brought improvement.
This was the effect of reaching the realm of perfection in the boxing technique, which greatly delighted him.
The food in his stomach was rapidly digested.
When he finally stopped, he rubbed his belly again.
";This is true cultivation!"; Jiang Ming smiled, took out his phone, opened the food delivery app, and found a restaurant sponsored by the City Lord Mansion.
";To cultivate senior high school students, there's a 50% discount on daily orders after real-name verification, but it can't exceed the standard for three meals.";
";Three thousand credits for a medicinal meal nourishing blood and qi, half-price still costs one thousand and five hundred.";
Jiang Ming placed the order for his three meals, equivalent to an average person's daily intake.
He utilized this time to ponder the techniques of Shock Fist.
According to his past life knowledge, among fifty classmates, only around ten had entered the gate of Shock Fist, and merely two had reached Minor Success, one of them being Wang Fatty.
As for Great Success?
There were only a few in the entire school.
Cultivating it was too difficult.
Jiang Ming pondered and understood why it was so difficult  Shock Fist emphasized generating power from inches, using this inch-power to shock the skin, muscles, bones, internal organs, and penetrate the bone marrow.
In short, it meant generating force outwardly and shocking inwardly, infiltrating the power into the bone marrow.
If practiced incorrectly, it could easily harm the body.
According to his memory, many students had hurt themselves fundamentally by obsessively practicing this technique.
There were even cases of people vomiting blood on the spot while practicing.
Besides that, it had to be combined with a unique breathing method. The breathing and martial arts fused together, exhaling with the external fist and inhaling internally, allowed the cultivation effect to reach its peak and enabled the force to affect the internal organs and marrow.
With his eyes closed, Jiang Ming's mind erupted in a storm of wisdom, analyzing the Shock Fist's training method, understanding the underlying principles of the martial arts, the key points of breathing, and so on.
He stopped when there was a knock on the door.
He collected the takeaway.
Putting two of the portions aside, he opened one of them, and there was no shortage in quantity: a nourishing Ginseng soup, a dish of ferocious beast meat, a dish of spiritual vegetables, a spiritual fruit, and two meat pancakes.
In a short while, everything entered his stomach. A warm current immediately surged in his stomach and flowed to his body. He knew this was the essence of the food being absorbed.
Standing up, he adjusted his condition and began to practice.
He raised his hand, inhaled, threw a punch, exhaled, inhaled three times in a row, his breath moved around twelve layers, went up to the upper focal region, entered the middle region, reached the lower region, then punched again. Within the space of a few inches, his power shook violently.
After one round, he found the feeling, and after two rounds, he already became familiar with the rhythm.
Three rounds, and he was enlightened.
Jiang Ming felt warm all over, and the numbness in his bones became more intense.
";No wonder Wang Fatty reached Muscle and Bone Resonance at such an early stage, and his power has now reached a subtle level, striving for the Second Realm of Martial Arts.";
He understood the reason for this: talent was one factor, and the excellent cultivation effect of Shock Fist was another.
Even just entering the gate was comparable to the effect after the perfection of Military Boxing.
Most of the essence transformed by the food he had eaten had been absorbed.
";Shock Fist, harmonized with breathing, is all about the word shock', which transfers power into the body and shakes the organs inside and out. Each round of practice is like a refinement, but once an error is made, internal injuries can easily occur.";
As Jiang Ming pondered, he continued to practice.
At midnight, after eating the third portion of food, he rested briefly and resumed cultivation.
Wasting time simply meant being irresponsible to his future self.
Within the square, and in between the inches, the power shook, and it seemed as if there was a surge of Qi and blood, and a resonance of muscles and bones.
His breathing also became stronger and more forceful.
Hum
After a long while, Jiang Ming paused slightly, and a strong and strange force surged from deep within his body, turning into a torrent that swept over his entire body.
Round after round, one after another.
This was the stimulating power of latent potential, a treasure hidden deep within the human body.
At the same time, black grease also seeped out from all the pores of his body.
";Shock Fist, Perfection!";
Jiang Ming exhaled a turbid breath, feeling exhilarated.
Was this the empowerment of Hundredfold Comprehension?
As his excitement slowly subsided, he went to the bathroom to take a shower. When he came out again, his skin was flushed and white, giving him a moist and full appearance.
Jiang Ming also felt that his whole body was transparent and much more relaxed, as if he had dispelled years of confinement.
He glanced at the crushed floor, didn't care much, then returned to the bedroom and fell into the bed to rest.
He was exhausted.
The next day, he woke up around five o'clock and rubbed his stomach.
He was starving.
After taking care of his personal hygiene, he found the milk and drank six packs before stopping.
";I can't practice at home anymore, or else, the whole place would be trampled down!";
Shaking his head, Jiang Ming opened the door and went out.
There was a park not far from the residential area.
When he arrived here, there were already many elderly men doing their morning exercises. Many of their movements seemed slow but were quite powerful.
He came to a corner, closed his eyes in contemplation, went through the content of Shock Fist again, and began to practice.
After each round, his whole body was filled with a tingling sensation, which was not uncomfortable. On the contrary, it was a greedy pleasure, much like the feeling of scratching an athlete's foot.
He couldn't get enough.
In the early morning sunlight, Jiang Ming indulged himself in his cultivation.
As he released his fist, there was even the sound of wind and thunder.


CHAPTER-3
3 Chapter 3: Yin and Yang

When he stopped, Jiang Ming felt an unmistakable increase in physical strength and power; it was definitely not an illusion.
";The numbness has spread throughout my body, and I'm not far from Muscle and Bone Resonance.";
";Definitely not far!";
Jiang Ming was invigorated.
Wiping his forehead, he shook off a series of beads of sweat, only to notice someone else practicing nearby. It was a girl wearing a white practice uniform, her hair tied up in a ponytail, her skin fair and delicate.
He recognized her as Yun Xiyao from the next class, also a beautiful scenery in the school.
Jiang Ming paid no attention to her and turned to leave.
It was time for breakfast.
Yun Xiyao stopped her practice and glanced at him, murmuring, ";Is he a student from the Second Level too? His Shock Fist is at least at the Great Success Realm, but I've never heard of him before.";
She dismissed the thought and continued her practice.
Compared to Jiang Ming, her movements were graceful and captivating.
After breakfast, Jiang Ming bought a large bottle of water and returned to the park. Just as he was about to start cultivating, his phone buzzed with a message.
Wang Fatty: ";Ming, it's time for class. Why haven't you come yet?";
Jiang Ming: ";I'm cultivating at home, I won't be coming! I'm going to ask the teacher for a leave of absence and give it my all before the College Entrance Exam. You should stop wasting time too. If you reach the Martial Arts Second Realm, you'll definitely have a chance to get into one of the top ten universities!";
Wang Fatty: ";I'm already trying my best, okay! The teacher is here, gotta go!";
Jiang Ming smiled.
His deskmate had greater potential than him but was a bit lazy.
After sending a message to the teacher, he put his phone on silent mode.
Looking up, Yun Xiyao had already left.
He continued practicing until noon before going home.
";I still haven't reached Muscle and Bone Resonance. This progress is too slow.";
Jiang Ming frowned in thought.
After achieving Muscle and Bone Resonance, he still needed to reach the Micro Power stage before breaking through to the Martial Arts Second Realm. He didn't need to think to know that breaking through would be even more difficult.
He turned on his phone, gritted his teeth, and ordered a medicinal meal that cost ten thousand credit points even after the discount.
";So extravagant!";
Even though it wasn't money he earned himself, he still felt a sharp pain. At this critical moment, he couldn't afford to skimp.
After lunch, he returned to a secluded corner of the park.
As he cultivated, he felt a surging force within his body, the medicinal power of the meal. As he continued to practice, he rapidly absorbed this power and turned it into his own strength.
Time flew by when immersed in a specific task. Unconsciously, night had fallen.
The numbness in his body had disappeared.
This was a sign of further improvement.
Tianwu Calendar 9918, May 27, early morning, a corner of the park.
Jiang Ming was still diligently cultivating.
An old man approached and watched him practice with a strange expression on his face.
";He has reached the Perfection Realm of Shock Fist, yet he hasn't achieved Muscle and Bone Resonance.";
";If he had great comprehension and terrible potential, it would explain it. But at his age, he should have reached Muscle and Bone Resonance.";
";Even if his family background is poor and his nutrition is lacking, once he exhibits a Perfection-Level Shock Fist, the school would definitely provide financial support. No, with his mastery of Soft Fist and Military Boxing, he would receive subsidies in middle school, or even elementary school.";
";This is really strange.";
He stood there, hands behind his back, watching with increasing gravity, ";He has taken the Shock Fist to its limit, and there is even a faint sense of transcending. This level of comprehension is extraordinary!";
Jiang Ming finally stopped and looked at him helplessly, ";Old man, have you seen enough?";
Feeling watched while practicing, he felt uneasy.
He also took the opportunity to observe the elder who looked kind and amiable, with a cheerful smile and especially striking long eyebrows.
";No!"; The elder laughed, ";I'm just curious, you've already perfected the Shock Fist, so why haven't your muscles and bones resonated yet? This is the first time I've seen such a situation in my countless years of experience.";
";It can't be that strange. While it's rare for someone in Pingyang City to perfect the Shock Fist, it's quite common in the world!"; Jiang Ming shook his head.
";Calm and composed, and with a worldly view, good temperament."; The elder praised, then said, ";It is indeed quite common. I've seen an eight-year-old perfect the Shock Fist and reach the Bone Forging Extreme Realm before turning nine; I've also seen someone comprehend the essence of Shock Fist within seven or eight days and reach the Bone Forging Peak within a month. But your situation is different.";
He paused and continued, ";After all, you're not young. You should be a senior high school student, about to face the Martial Exam. Before this, your Soft Fist and Military Boxing should have already reached a perfected state, and after practicing the Shock Fist for so many years, you still haven't resonated with your muscles and bones, which is quite rare.";
";I could've just had a sudden breakthrough!"; Jiang Ming immediately understood what was going on.
It's a process to achieve perfection in Shock Fist, but a perfected eighteen-year-old student is not normal.
At the same time, he was also shocked.
Perfected Shock Fist at age eight and reached Bone Forging Extreme Realm at nine?
Comprehended the essence of Shock Fist within just seven or eight days?
Are these the geniuses of this world?
They're truly extraordinary!
";A sudden breakthrough?"; The elder hesitated for a moment, then realized, ";Right, that must be it!"; However, he looked at Jiang Ming with even more astonishment, pondering, ";I have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here, do you want to give it a try?";
";Old man!"; Jiang Ming sighed, ";There are only a few days left before the Martial Exam, and I still haven't resonated with my muscles and bones. I can't afford to waste time.";
";I have a Peiyuan Pill on me, if you pass the test, how about I give it to you?"; The elder smiled, ";It won't take long.";
";A Peiyuan Pill? The one that's said to be gentler than gene medicine, has no side effects, and is the best auxiliary elixir for the Bone Forging Realm?"; Jiang Ming was surprised, ";I've heard that a single pill is worth 200,000. Are you willing to give it away for just a test?";
";Of course!"; The elder nodded.
";Then please tell me, old man?"; Jiang Ming rubbed his hands, looking very pleased.
He cannot afford a 200,000 Peiyuan Pill.
";I like your money-loving look, haha!"; The elder couldn't help but laugh out loud, then said seriously, ";I have a body refining fist technique, watch carefully. If you can achieve minor success today, I will give you the Peiyuan Pill!";
As soon as his words fell, he began to perform his fist technique.
Jiang Ming raised his eyebrows: The elder casually took out a 200,000 Peiyuan Pill, he must be a high-ranked senior, and now he's demonstrating his technique, shouldn't his energy and demeanor be transcendent, on the level of the Nine Heavens? Why does he still look so loose and slouchy?
However, he also stared intently at the elder.
";This technique is called the Yin Yang Fist. Yang is external and strong, aggressive and fierce, yet it enters the body in reverse. Yin is internal and soft, adaptable as it endures storms, shoulders strength and aggression, using both strength and softness together as one, interchanging between Yin and Yang, to achieve the effects of refining the body, strengthening the organs, improving blood circulation, and washing the marrow.";
";The principles contained in this fist technique are even deeper than those of the Shock Fist.";
";Watch carefully!";
The elder was still practicing within a small space, back and forth.
Softness containing strength, the Inch Fist dominating; strength containing softness, everything turning as desired. Within the interplay of Yin and Yang, of strength and softness, the entire body is refined from the inside out.
After one round, the elder stopped, still smiling, ";Have you understood? Do you need me to demonstrate it again?";
";I've understood and don't need to see it again!"; Jiang Ming said as he closed his eyes.
The elder's eyes brightened, his interest growing even more.
At this moment, a storm of comprehension erupted in Jiang Ming's mind.
Countless thoughts transformed into little figures in the emptiness of his mind, practicing the Yin Yang Fist, even incorporating his understanding of the Soft Fist and Shock Fist.
After a while, Jiang Ming opened his eyes, assumed a stance, and said, ";Old man, watch closely!";
After one round, he did it correctly, earning the elder's admiration.
Two rounds, he got the hang of it, and the elder nodded in agreement.
Three rounds, he achieved minor success, and the elder gasped in awe.
Six rounds, it seemed like great success, and the elder was overjoyed.
After ten rounds, he directly achieved perfection, and the elder's eyes widened in shock, rubbing his hands together as if he was a 3,000-year-old bachelor who had just seen an old pimp.


CHAPTER-4
4 Chapter Four: Opening the Sea of Qi

Jiang Ming had already stopped.
When he had achieved perfection in Yin Yang Fist, a strange power surged up from the depths of his body, sweeping over his entire body, cleansing his marrow and purifying his muscles.
He couldn't tell if it was due to experiencing it three times before, but this time the effect was not as good as the Domineering Boxing, yet there was still a minute amount of impurities being expelled from his body.
This made him feel that his body was stronger, his strength was greater, and his vitality was even more vigorous.
This was an significant enhancement once again.
However, Jiang Ming also realized the remarkable nature of Yin Yang Fist. If he did not have the foundation of Soft Fist and Shock Fist, he would never have comprehended the essence of Yin Yang Fist so quickly. At least a dozen times of practice would be needed to fully master it.
";Old man, how was it?"; Jiang Ming asked with a smile.
";Impressive, your comprehension is rare in the world!"; The elder exclaimed in astonishment and then took out a jade bottle from his bosom. After opening it, he poured out a pill.
Jiang Ming was startled.
Because the bottle was full of elixir pills.
";This is my snack. If you don't want to eat food, just take one!"; The elder laughed, passed over a Peiyuan Pill, gave a brief explanation, and asked, ";You are a student of Second Level, aren't you? What's your name?";
";I am Jiang Ming from Class Four of Second Level."; He revealed his identity without thinking and then finally suppressed the surging thoughts in his mind. He couldn't help but praise, ";Elder, you are really generous. May I ask your name?";
At the same time, he took the elixir pill.
Immediately, an aroma pounced on his nose, causing his spirits to rise.
";My last name is Tang, and you can just call me Old Tang.";
";Old Tang? I dare not. I am afraid that a slap of yours might kill me. I'll call you Elder Tang!";
";Haha, you, young lad!"; Elder Tang couldn't help laughing, ";Dare to take it right away?";
";Why wouldn't I? I am penniless!";
Jiang Ming said as he swallowed the elixir pill.
Warm currents immediately bubbled up in his stomach, gentle as water, yet incredibly potent.
He started to practice boxing again.
Yin Yang Fist.
The fists created a roar like wind and thunder.
As time passed, Jiang Ming's punches became heavier, shaking the air, and many of the surrounding leaves were shaken off.
His momentum was getting stronger and stronger.
Bang
The air exploded, and a resonating sound emanated from Jiang Ming. It was faint at first, but it soon became deafening, like the roar of a dragon, the cry of a phoenix, or the thunder from the Nine Heavens.
Muscle and Bone Resonance was achieved.
But Jiang Ming didn't stop because the medicinal power hadn't completely worn off yet.
His tendons were akin to mysterious ropes, bones grinding like gears, blood raced like a herd of wild horses, and his heart pounded like a war drum.
Elder Tang at the side kept nodding his approval.
";Good comprehension! Good constitution!";
";If given enough time";
";He must have recently awakened. Otherwise, with such constitution, he should have at least come across the Sea of Qi, if not reaching the Martial Realm of the Third Level.";
";Indeed, a raw gemstone!";
The praise from Elder Tang was indeed high.
Immediately after, his eyebrows twitched, and his expression of joy intensified.
Because the resonance sound of Jiang Ming's muscle and bone kept weakening, until it gradually vanished.
";The power has condensed into one, as easy as commanding his own arm, with a fine grasp."; Elder Tang applauded and began to speak. ";Enhancing constitution, intensifying power, refining muscles and bones, whether by gene medicine or elixir pill, can be accomplished. So, why do we still need step-by-step cultivation?";
No one answered, but he continued, ";Because the path of martial arts doesn't only enhance power. The journey of cultivation is also a process of self-tempering will.";
";When the Muscle and Bone Resonance is achieved, it signifies the Refinement of the Body.";
";Condensing the strength into one, it's the tempering of self-will. Only with a stronger will, can one comprehend the energy of Heaven and Earth, or say the cosmic energy, primal qi, spiritual qi, etc., and then channel them into the body, opening the Dantian Sea of Qi.";
";Without a strong will, one cannot comprehend the Heaven and Earth.";
";The power cannot be condensed into one force and cannot connect to heaven and earth to tap into the breath of the cosmos.";
";Without the resonance of muscles and bones, and inner and outer strength, it cannot withstand the ferocity of the breath of the cosmos.";
";On the path of martial arts, each step ascends toward heaven, but the path is under your feet. Be it medicine for gene enhancement or elixir pills, they are merely aids.";
Elder Tang clearly explained the first hurdle and the secrets of cultivation in martial arts.
";After entering the microcosm, comprehend the cosmos, seize the fate in the dark. Transform it into a giant whale swallowing everything, or become a black hole snatching, or open the convenient door to invite guests and invite the force with a refined body to the Dantian to open the Sea of Qi.";
Elder Tang expounded the secret to breaking through to the next realm.
The teacher had already explained this in class, but it wasn't as vivid as his analogy.
He looked up at Jiang Ming's head.
At this moment, Jiang Ming had already reached this step.
After the resonance of muscles and bones, continue to cultivate, train the power thoroughly. The vibrating force between the fascia gradually hides, returning to the body.
This is the gradual process of mastery and returning to the natural state.
Once the resonance of muscles and bones completely disappears, the power is thoroughly trained, controlled as if it were an extension of the arm; the power enters the microcosm.
A Peiyuan Pill strengthens the foundation.
The strong comprehension also brings a strong spirit. The control over the self far exceeds ordinary people.
This step of entry into the microcosm is hardly a challenge.
At this step, one could break through, or he could stop and continue to hone, preparing for the breakthrough.
Jiang Ming, however, was not satisfied and continued his boxing techniques.
Hearing Elder Tang, he was thoughtful. His thoughts naturally flowed into the cosmos with the power he had refined into a single force.
He felt the breath of the cosmos, no, the primal Qi of heaven and earth, or the energy of the universe.
Incredibly vast and boundless.
Even the slightest ripple could crush him.
Jiang Ming imagined himself as a black hole, attracting everything. He used his thoughts as a guide, trying to bring the power of heaven and earth into his body. But this vast power was too stable.
He was not disheartened.
The boxing techniques continued, using the principles of Yin and Yang, a perfect balance of strength and softness. As he changed steps, the fallen leaves in his surroundings started to circle around him.
";Dao Resonance aids him!"; Seeing this, Elder Tang couldn't help but gasped. It was an almost impossible feat at the Bone Forging Realm.
But he saw this with his own eyes  this is a cultivation skill that he had just started practicing.
";Such raw talent is beyond imagination. Perhaps, he can really intake the Qi in one fell swoop and start to open the Dantian Sea of Qi.";
Expectation gleamed in Elder Tang's eyes.
Buzz
At this moment, a tremor passed through the void.
Jiang Ming seemed to transform into Yin-Yang Tai Chi, performing the Tao of the strong and flexible. Echoing a special Dao Resonance, he successfully drew a thin trace of energy from heaven and earth. This energy traveled through the Hundred Meetings, passed Heaven's Gate, descended Twenty-Four Floors, and reached straight to the Dantian.
";Don't hesitate, press on!";
Elder Tang's voice rang out again.
Jiang Ming continued his boxing techniques, but his expression had already grown incredibly solemn.
The power that had followed his summoning was ferocious, making it almost impossible to bind. Luckily, his mind was firm and his flesh was resilient. He condensed the power into a single force to contain and guide its descent to his Dantian.
";Success or failure, it all depends on this!"; Jiang Ming fortified his determination and directly directed the power in.
Boom
In an instant, it felt like the primordial world had exploded, akin to the creation of heaven and earth. He felt a loud noise in his mind as his Dantian blew open and rapidly expanded.
At the same time, a stream of eerie power swept through his entire body.
The strength and purity of this power was more than ten times greater than when he practiced Yin Yang Fist to perfection and underwent Cleansing Marrow. It was truly unbelievable.


CHAPTER-5
5 Chapter 5: Soul Dominator

Muscles and bones resonated in harmony, and power penetrated every detail. Jiang Ming directly broke through to the Second Realm of Martial Arts, the Qi Sea Realm.
No matter what, Jiang Ming could not have imagined that today he would achieve this in one fell swoop, not only increasing his cultivation level but also completing the System Task.
";Ding: Congratulations to the host for stepping into the Second Realm of Martial Arts within seven days. The Hundredfold Talent of Comprehension is permanently solidified.";
At this moment, Jiang Ming felt that a layer of shackles had been unlocked from his thoughts and spirits; they completely merged into his bloodline and imprinted on his soul.
";Ding: The host has opened the qi sea, stepped into the Second Realm of Martial Arts, and temporarily solidified the Soul Dominator' talent.";
";Ding: Please become the Provincial Champion in the first round of the Martial Arts Test, or the Soul Dominator' talent will disappear.";
Jiang Ming didn't pay attention and continued to open the Dantian.
As for the power that flowed back from the Dantian, he knew that this was the power of autonomous potential creation. Breaking the qi sea, opening the Dantian, and advancing the realm was actually digging out one's potential; this naturally brought out the hidden power of creation within the body, cleansing the marrow, and establishing the foundation.
Elder Tang's voice rang out again.
";When breaking through and opening the Sea of Qi, this step is crucial. The size of the Dantian space represents the strength of future potential. However, once the Sea of Qi is opened, it will solidify. Even if the Sea of Qi can continue to grow, it would not be as much as one-tenth of the time when breaking through.";
";With an unyielding spirit, keep guiding the breath of Heaven and Earth to expand the Dantian until the limit is reached or the spirit becomes exhausted.";
";But don't be reckless. After initially stepping into the Second Realm, the willpower of the immortal cultivator is still weak. Once the spirit is exhausted, the foundation will be injured and the future will be destroyed.";
";You have to find the right balance on your own.";
Elder Tang was somewhat nervous.
Jiang Ming remained still, but his eyes were tightly closed.
Above his head, there was an invisible vortex, absorbing the breath of Heaven and Earth into his body while also hearing Elder Tang's voice.
His heart stirred slightly.
His spirit was already strong, and now that he had acquired the Soul Dominator' talent, his spiritual power reached an immeasurable level.
Invoking the power of Heaven and Earth became easier.
With the shifting of thoughts and the spreading of consciousness, his entire body seemed to merge into Heaven and Earth.
He himself seemed to become a part of Heaven and Earth.
";This…"; Elder Tang suddenly widened his eyes, revealing an incredulous expression.
";Merge into Heaven and Earth?";
";The whole body is attracting primal qi.";
";It seems that his spirit has also surged.";
";This transformation, this comprehension, this talent!";
";Damn it, it's really incredible!";
Elder Tang smacked his lips, and then his eyes lit up, more excited than when he saw the little beauty in the Monster Pavilion.
At this moment, Jiang Ming did not only attract primal qi from the Baihui acupoint but from all over his body. Waves of primal qi were being drawn in and infused into the Dantian.
He seemed to have turned into a black hole, devouring the energy of Heaven and Earth.
Inside the Qi Sea, as the power of Heaven and Earth entered, it was immediately assimilated into Jiang Ming's own power. Most of it merged into the Qi Sea barrier, expanding outward.
";So this is the qualitative change caused by the Soul Dominator!";
Jiang Ming also gained some insight.
Although he hadn't checked the ability of the Soul Dominator yet, he was certain that this talent was no less than the Hundredfold Comprehension, even more terrifying.
Just the initial integration allowed him to merge into Heaven and Earth, as if he could see the operation of the rules and the countless creations.
Finally, he stopped.
It was not mental fatigue, but reaching the limit in the space of his Dantian.
The sun had long since risen from the sea, casting its speckled shadows through the branches and leaves.
";Incredible, incredible!"; Elder Tang couldn't help but exclaim.
Merging into Heaven and Earth?
What a terrifying talent!
Moreover, he continued to absorb the primal qi without stopping, the long duration of which amazed him.
";Jiang(author's note: surname), how far has the space in your Dantian reached?"; Elder Tang couldn't help but ask, then quickly followed up, ";Don't say it, don't say it. I'm afraid it'll be a blow to me.";
Judging from the situation just now, the space within Dantian is at least one zhang in radius.
One zhang? Two zhang? Three zhang?
It's like going against the heavens!
";In the past, the Federation has collected information about the Powerful of the Second Realm of Martial Arts from 108 Provinces to carry out statistics. Results found that most martial artists' Dantian space was only about one chi; a person with average talent had their dantian space around two chi; and three chi represented top-notch genius. If the space in the Sea of Qi reached more than five chi, then it is of unparalleled genius; above one zhang is considered unrivaled in the world."; Elder Tang explained briefly while looking at him, fully revealing an expression of admiration towards Jiang.
";Thank you, Elder!"; Jiang Ming sincerely bowed in gratitude to the old man.
A Peiyuan Pill helped to make up for the shortcomings in the foundation, fully unleashing his terrifying potential.
";It's just a single elixir pill. To me, it's as simple as a meal."; Elder Tang waved his hand dismissively.
";But to me, it's a stroke of luck, especially before the Martial Exam."; Jiang Ming smiled and said, ";My Dantian's Sea of Qi is at least two zhang!";
In fact, it was actually ten zhang.
Not an inch less.
";Two zhang? An unparalleled genius among Tianjiao(author's note: genius peers)! An unmatched talent!"; Elder Tang couldn't help but gasp, saying happily, ";This little guy is going to rise up.";
";Elder Tang, with my current situation, can I become a Province Top Scorer?"; Jiang Ming asked.
";Province Top Scorer? What are you thinking about!"; Elder Tang couldn't help but laugh, ";Tianzhong Province has a population of hundreds of millions, with about 800,000 people participating in the martial exam. There are so many geniuses. Even those who have reached the Third Realm of Martial Arts will appear, and you are probably not on par with them. After all, your breakthrough is too late; you haven't accumulated enough, and you don't even have a practice method. You need to have a cultivation method, a realm, and combat skills. Other than the realm, you still lack cultivation. Furthermore, you lack experience in fighting. To become a Province Top Scorer in the martial exam would be as difficult as reaching the sky, but";
He hesitated slightly.
At this moment, Jiang Ming's heart sank, but the word ";but"; caught his attention, and he couldn't help but ask, ";Elder Tang, is there still a chance?";
";Yes!"; Elder Tang became serious and said, ";Ten Thousand Realms Tower!";
";Ten Thousand Realms Tower?";
Jiang Ming suddenly understood.
He had heard that Ten Thousand Realms Tower was a tower controlled by the City Lord Mansion. Inside the Tower, there were many World Secret Realm entrances that were temporarily solidified, and only those who had reached the Second Realm of Martial Arts were eligible to enter.
The Secret Realm was magical inside. No matter how many years had passed, it was only an hour outside.
Upon entering, one could hone their martial skills, improve their cultivation level, increase their experience, and so on. However, if one failed to meet the requirements, everything they had gained would be erased, and they could die inside.
Once dead, it was truly over.
The mortality rate was not low.
For a while, many people ventured into the Secret Realm, resulting in a staggering death rate of 40%. Later on, only those who knew their limits dared to go there.
Even now, the death rate was around 10%.
According to the statistics, only about 5% of the people could benefit from it.
Ordinary people hardly dared to venture into the World Secret Realm.
";Don't get carried away, kid!"; Seeing that Jiang Ming was tempted, Elder Tang quickly stopped him, ";Don't underestimate your talent and the Sea of Qi you opened! With your talent and the opened Qi Sea, your future is boundless. Although being a Provincial Champion brings great honor and benefits, it's not worth your life. Moreover, you can obtain those benefits easily in the future. If you're worried about not getting into a good martial school, I can guarantee you a spot in Central Divine Martial College.";


CHAPTER-6
6 Chapter 6: The Spirit Lives On

After exchanging contact information with Elder Tang, Jiang Ming hurried home.
After a quick wash, he sat on the sofa and a system template appeared before his eyes.
Name: Jiang Ming
Cultivation: Qi Sea Realm (Martial Arts Second Realm)
Cultivation Skills: Yin Yang Fist, Thunderstorm Nine Slashes
Talents: Hundredfold Comprehension, Soul Dominator (Temporary Solidification)
Task: Become the Province Top Scorer in the Martial Arts Exam Preliminary Selection
Many changes took place in the information.
Even Jiang Ming himself couldn't believe that he would open up a ten-zhang-wide Qi Sea Space. According to Elder Tang, a space larger than one zhang would already make one an unrivaled genius.
But he had ten zhang.
There are no records on the internet about a Dantian Qi Sea Space of ten zhang.
The highest record was only three zhang, and it's unclear whether it's true or not.
Jiang Ming clenched his fist, feeling the surging power like a great river, giving him the illusion of being able to smash a building with a single punch.
";Too strong!";
";After the Muscle and Bone Resonance, the power entered the micro level, and I could feel that I could easily kill my past self. As for now? One slap could kill my past self when he had entered the micro level.";
";The potential power feedback from the ten-zhang Qi Sea Space has made my body incredibly strong.";
Jiang Mingfinally understood why the martial arts realm was so significant.
Even if he had only just entered the second realm of martial arts, he was already incredibly strong.
Suppressing the waves in his heart.
There were also changes in the other aspects, but the most attractive to him was the talent column.
Soul Dominator:Soul as the foundation; spirit as the application. Your soul characteristics change, your spirit strengthens, and as your cultivation level increases, you possess the potential to become the master of your soul. Immune to most soul curses and spiritual attacks, you can quickly learn similar techniques and see through the essence of the world. Your soul is immortal, and your spirit will last forever.
This is the basic information that the system brought.
As for other abilities? He had to explore them on his own.
Jiang Ming closed his eyes and contemplated, his spiritual senses spreading out, and everything within a ten-meter radius became clear in his mind, albeit veiled by a layer of fog.
Even so, he could detect the slightest changes.
He could also get a general idea of the neighbors and even capture their scents, sensing a special fluctuation, which should be a unique life magnetic field.
It was amazing.
When Jiang Ming opened his eyes, this sense weakened, and as he looked at the cup before him, he reached out and caught it as it wobbled slightly and flew into his hand.
";Am I a superhero now?";
He couldn't help but laugh.
After a few trials, he found that the weight of the objects he could control could not exceed one kilogram.
The most amazing thing was his immunity to spiritual and soul attacks.
There have been powerful people on Blue Star who controlled the power of the spirit, but there had never been any mention of curses, so it would be hard to say if they would appear when they stepped onto the Ten Thousand Realms Battlefield in the future.
In addition, it gets stronger as one's cultivation level increases, so there is no need to practice separately.
";It should be saved as a trump card to save my life, and not be used easily!";
Since he didn't know much about it, it was better to keep a low profile.
";Only the Province Top Scorer?";
Jiang Ming felt a bit of a headache.
First, there's the College Entrance Exam, then the Provincial Exam, and finally, the United States Major Examination to determine the final champion. According to Elder Tang's words and the records of previous college entrance exams, it would be extremely difficult for him to become the Province Top Scorer in the preliminary selection stage.
Even using mental power was almost impossible.
";It's because of the powerful martial artists";
As he raised his hand, a stream of Qi flowed out and quickly dissipated into the air.
He had not yet practiced suitable cultivation techniques and combat skills for the Qi Sea Realm and could not effectively use Qi.
In the Martial Arts Second Realm of the Qi Sea Realm, if Qi is sufficient, it can already be used to enhance one's fists and weapons, and even forming a detached attack.
As for the Third layer of martial arts?
It would be even stronger.
";Ten Thousand Realms Tower, should I really go?";
Jiang Ming frowned.
Now that he had tasted the sweetness of the Soul Dominator talent, giving it up was not an option.
After having lunch, he took a short rest before rushing to school.
When he arrived at the school gate, he saw a girl walking over from the other side, Yun Xiyao from the next class. She brightened her eyes when she saw Jiang Ming and waved, ";Wait a moment, fellow student.";
She quickly walked over.
Swiveling her waist.
";What's up?"; Jiang Ming furrowed his brows slightly.
";Well"; Yun Xiyao hesitated, tucking her hair behind her ears, her voice playfully said, ";Classmate, I saw you practicing at Jinshui Park, I didn't expect we go to the same school.";
";I'm in Class Four, you're in Class Five!";
";Hehe, what a coincidence! Classmate, I saw your understanding of Shock Fist far exceeds mine, could you give me some pointers?"; Yun Xiyao asked with expectation amidst her coyness.
";Why not ask your teacher?";
";Our class instructor is a middle-aged man, his gaze on people is very very uncomfortable, and I heard he didn't even cultivate his Shock Fist to the Great Success Realm back then. After entering the Qi Sea Realm, he probably won't practice it anymore.";
";I see, what's the problem? Just tell me!"; Jiang Ming hesitated a bit, but nodded in agreement since they were from the same school.
";It's the ninth movement, no matter how hard I try, I can't perform it perfectly and fluently with my breathing technique."; Yun Xiyao quickly said.
";Speaking about it is useless, let's do this, you demonstrate once for me to see."; Jiang Ming said, pointing to the side and walking over.
";Alright!"; Yun Xiyao was overjoyed and began her demonstration after walking over. Jiang Ming's voice came over, ";Stop!";
Yun Xiyao froze.
Jiang Ming adjusted her left shoulder and said, ";Before the ninth movement, your inhale should be deeper, sinking into your navel. Your left shoulder should drop by three points, and your wrist slightly bent.";
";Stop it!"; At this moment, a furious shout came from the distance, as a male student dashed towards them with incredible speed.
As fast as a cheetah, he quickly reached them and angrily shouted, ";How dare you molest Xiyao in broad daylight? You're asking for death!";
Jiang Ming frowned and launched a counterattack before the other student could land a hit on him. He used the soft power from Yin Yang Fist.
Watching as the other student stopped, Jiang Ming said, ";Classmate, did you understand the situation before acting?";
He then looked at Yun Xiyao, who seemed excited. This left him puzzled.
";I saw it with my own eyes!"; The male student attacked once more and aimed a punch at Jiang Ming's chest but was once again repelled.
";That's twice now!"; Jiang Ming's expression darkened. ";Yun, aren't you going to explain?";
";You audacious guy, how dare you threaten our goddess right in front of me? Seeking death!"; The male student became even more enraged, leaping up and kicking toward Jiang Ming's shoulder.
He was still somewhat rational, not aiming for the neck.
";No more third or fourth chances!"; Jiang Ming was utterly annoyed. In his eyes, the opponent's speed was extremely slow.
He raised his palm like a knife, striking the other student's leg and then knocked him away with another palm. The male student fell to the ground, unable to get up.
Jiang Ming looked at Yun Xiyao expressionlessly, but she gazed back at him with bright, expectant eyes, as if saying: You're so amazing!
For fuck's sake!
Jiang Ming walked over to the male student and looked at his pained expression. In a low voice, he said, ";She asked me for guidance on her Shock Fist practice. I was just giving her some pointers. You attacked me without knowing the situation, and she didn't stop you or explain. She didn't comfort or explain to you after you've been continuously defeated, do you understand?";
";You must be really into her, but look at the result? Ha!";
";Brown noser, you've become nothing but a dog in the end!";
";Look at you, you're just like a dog, a pitiful dog no one cares for!";
Jiang Ming left after saying this.
He originally thought Yun Xiyao's dedication to her morning training at the park showed good character, but the outcome made him want to curse.
His good mood was completely ruined for the day.
";Classmate, why are you leaving?"; Yun Xiyao called out, puzzled.
By giving her pointers, wasn't he pursuing her?
After defeating another pursuer, shouldn't he be bragging about his excellence to her? And then taking it a step further by exchanging contact information, or even asking to go out together.
According to her experience, that's how all male students should behave, right?
What's going on?
She truly didn't understand.
The male student lying on the ground was initially enraged and embarrassed, but when he saw Yun Xiyao's reaction and her indifference to his plight, he almost spat out a mouthful of blood.
He suddenly remembered Jiang Ming's words: You're like a dog now, a pitiful dog no one cares for!
I've really become a dog!
Fuck!
Jiang Ming went to look for Head Teacher Mr. Chen.
";Jiang Ming, didn't you take a long leave? Why are you here?"; Mr. Chen put down the pen in his hand, ";Is there something you don't understand about your cultivation? Tell me!";
Jiang Ming raised his hand, and Qi flowed out.
";Qi overflow? Real Qi! You've opened your Sea of Qi and stepped into the Martial Arts Second Realm!"; Mr. Chen suddenly stood up, his astonishment unmatched.
";Yes!"; Jiang Ming smiled, ";I just broke through and came to find you for school certification.";
";How is that possible? I remember you haven't even reached the Muscle and Bone Resonance stage, how are you already in the Martial Arts Second Realm?"; After his initial surprise, Mr. Chen was puzzled, but still delighted, ";Come, let's certify you first. Opening the Sea of Qi is equivalent to obtaining an admission voucher to a first-tier Martial Arts University, and there will be various benefits. Haha, fantastic!";


CHAPTER-7
7 Chapter Seven: Return to the Origin

The certification was simple, it just involved measuring one's strength, and then record and archive it.
From then on, Jiang Ming became a martial artist of the Martial Arts Second Realm, and enjoyed various benefits. Social welfare: for those who reached the Second Realm of Martial Arts before 24, housing would be half-priced, as well as half-priced food and goods in certain places, and so on.
There were also rewards inside the school, such as being awarded a cultivation skill, a combat skill, and a weapon of choice, and so forth.
The benefits of being a powerful martial artist were beyond imagination.
Class Four.
Jiang Ming entered the classroom, which was sparsely populated with students.
";How come you're here, youngster?"; Wang Fatty was flabbergasted.
";Missed you, didn't I?"; Jiang Ming said with a smile.
";I'm not a beautiful woman, stop talking nonsense,"; Wang Fatty lowered his voice and glanced at a delicate girl in front of him, ";Are you missing the class flower?";
The girl's ears twitched and she shot a warning glance at them.
A round face, delicate but mixed with humor.
Her name was Qin Zhiyan, her cheeks flushed and implied the fluctuation of primal qi around her.
Wang Fatty retracted his neck.
Jiang Ming smiled and pointed at Wang Fatty, then shrugged his shoulders.
The girl snorted lightly, grinding her teeth.
At this point, school was over. Most of the students in the classroom either came back to rest after practicing in the school practice room, or were preparing for the literary exam as they felt they couldn't make it into Martial Arts University.
People like Wang Fatty were rare.
";What are you always doing in class?"; Jiang Ming was genuinely puzzled.
";Ah!"; Wang Fatty sighed softly, ";Once I leave, I won't be able to come back. This is the final attachment, the last unwillingness to let go of youth, and the ultimate farewell to carefreeness.";
";I don't believe you!"; Jiang Ming frowned, ";You're not going to try for a breakthrough?";
";Even if I try, could I possibly open the qi sea!";
";You come and see!";
Jiang Ming raised his hand and qi flowed from his fingertips. Although it was invisible, it could be clearly sensed.
";Damn!"; Wang Fatty almost jumped up, ";Jiang Ming, you've actually opened your Qi Sea, this, this";
All the other students looked over.
Their look was one of confusion.
They were all from the same class, they knew each other's strength, Jiang Ming opening his Qi Sea? What nonsense.
He had not even achieved Muscle and Bone Resonance, it was impossible to open the Qi Sea.
Even if he had reached the realm of entering the microcosm, it would take more than a day or two to break through.
At this point, the phones all chimed with notifications.
It was a message from the teacher in the class group: ";Congratulations, let's celebrate! Our classmate Jiang Ming has opened his Dantian Qi Sea and stepped into the Martial Arts Second Realm. Let's celebrate again. Fellow students, time is running out, don't waste more time, keep working hard, you might be the next Jiang Ming!";
The classroom was instantly abuzz.
Wang Fatty rubbed his eyes, looked at his phone, then looked at his deskmate, blurted out, ";Demon, reveal yourself, when else are you going to wait!";
Jiang Ming was speechless.
";You are definitely a demon!"; Qin Zhiyan walked over with a face full of curiosity and disbelief, ";How did you open the Qi Sea? I remember that last time one slap nearly disassembled you. Say, have you been possessed by a demon?";
";I even dual cultivated with a demon!"; Jiang Ming said impatiently.
";So it's the merit of dual cultivation!"; Wang Fatty suddenly realized, ";Speak, which demon is it? Does she have sisters?";
Jiang Ming was left speechless.
However, Qin Zhiyan patted his shoulder. The first pat was heavy, the second even heavier, and at the third, seeing that Jiang Ming was unmoving, she nodded approvingly but her face was particularly serious.
She looked at Jiang Ming with more confusion, but simply offered, ";Work hard to achieve a good result at the Martial Exam.";
After saying that she returned to her seat.
Jiang Ming watched her go, noting that this girl was unusual.
With those three pats, the first was heavy enough for his usual self to bear; the second was much heavier, and the third was clearly enhanced with Qi.
As for exposing himself, and the teacher revealing the situation in the class chat group, he didn't care at all as it could not be hidden anyway.
There wasn't a need to.
After all, it's a martial world; the stronger you are, the more benefits you obtain, which is a different story from concealing one's mental power.
Not wanting to stay in class any longer, he dragged Wang Fatty out with him.
";I still can't believe you've entered the Qi Sea Realm."; Wang Fatty scratched his head, obviously perplexed.
No one knew his desk mate better than he did.
";I swallowed a Peiyuan Pill, and then I broke through step by step, directly opening my Dantian!"; explained Jiang Ming.
";Even with the Peiyuan Pill, you shouldn't be able to!"; Wang Fatty protested, ";Look at me, I've been in the microscopic realm for a long time, but I just can't grasp the opportunity to break through. To achieve this, one must sense heaven and earth's rhythm, feel Primal Qi, slowly disturb the solid-as-mountain Qi Sea, draw in heaven and earth's rhythm, and let Qi enter the body to open the Dantian! Normally, this process requires at least half a year of preparation.";
";That's because I'm a genius!";
";If you're a genius, then I'm a demon.";
";Demon, reveal your true form so the old monk can capture you.";
";Piss off.";
Jokingly, Jiang Ming went to the equipment center to get a blade, a cross-blade type to be exact. As for cultivation methods? He could simply claim them online; it wasn't so troublesome.
";How do you feel?"; Jiang Ming took out the long blade, spun it around, raised an eyebrow, and smiled, ";You're 195 cm tall and weigh 300 kg, been in the microscopic realm for three months now. What has resulted from it? Weren't you surpassed by me? Are you envious? Are you jealous?";
";I even hate it!"; Wang Fatty hummed, gritted his teeth, and said, ";No, you have surpassed me, this is embarrassing. I'm going home to train right away, I'll close the door and train, I won't come out until I break through.";
";Kid, you better not play around. Breaking through is vital; if you make a slight mistake, it will be a lifelong matter!";
";Rest assured!";
They parted ways, each heading home.
At home.
Jiang Ming sat on the sofa, a cross-blade on his lap, eyes closed. In his mind, the method of Thunderstorm Nine Slashes practice flowed.
His mind was whirring, wisdom sparking.
It seemed as if a virtual space truly manifested in his mind, where numerous avatars, condensed from his powerful spirit, began to rehearse the blade technique.
It was far more intuitive than when he was deducing the cultivation method before.
Though the name Thunderstorm Nine Slashes sounded powerful, its actual practice was simple — it was domineering, fearless, quick to strike, its force deep, using power to suppress opponents.
In no time, Jiang Ming opened his eyes again.
With a clang.
He stood up, pulled out the long blade, and slashed, splitting the air in half.
He was practicing right in the living room.
In less than ten minutes, he reached a pitch-perfect level of performance.
Blade skills, perfected.
It was already understood theoretically when he was deducing in his mind, but in actuality, he still needed to practice, adjusting his muscles and exertion, in order for illusion and reality to come together as one.
In short, it's all about theory and practice.
Comprehension was the theory, and training was the practice.
When the two are combined, one reaches the grand path.
";Now I can comprehend the cultivation skill even faster!";
Apart from Hundredfold Comprehension, the Soul Dominator talent certainly gave a boost.
Sheathed the blade, opened his phone, and checked the class group chat. Good grief, there were thousands of unread messages already!
";They're all youngsters; their hands move way too fast!";
A swift glance, many of them were talking about him, expressing shock, confusion, misunderstanding, Wang Fatty's comment on how he ate a Peiyuan Pill, causing most classmates to denounce him as a rich bastard'.
Jiang Ming exited the chat group, logged into the school's intranet, and started to select cultivation skills.
";Choose the cultivation skill carefully.";
";Those chosen by the most people are usually universal, even though they might not be the best, they are certainly not bad.";
";Alright, Guiyuan Sutra it is!";
";Combat skill? Still sticking with weapons, definitely blade technique then. Huh, this blade technique Thunderstorm Nine Slashes, according to the description, is the sequential evolution of Thunderstorm Nine Slashes, one leading to another, interesting, I'll take it!";
After selecting, he received the two cultivation techniques in his mailbox swiftly. Instead of diving right in, Jiang Ming looked up Qi Sea Realm on the school's intranet, browsed various martial arts posts, and researched information about Ten Thousand Realms Tower.
As for Ten Thousand Realms Tower, he might really have to give it a try.


CHAPTER-8
8 Chapter 8: Entering the Small World

The sun slanted, and a gentle breeze blew.
It was the lazy afternoon time.
In an exquisitely beautiful courtyard, two elders sat facing each other, drinking tea.
";Old Tang, you said there was good news and insisted I come over. I've come, and we've had two cups of tea, but you're still all smiles. What's the good news? If you don't tell me, I'll leave. You're here for a vacation, but what about me? I have tons of things to deal with!";
";Old Song, look at you getting so anxious. At this age, can't you take it easy?"; Old Tang chuckled.
";I'm not like you, all accomplished. I'm just a tired soul."; Old Song snorted, ";These days, taking care of you has really worn me out. You, old man, should never have come back!";
";Alright, alright. You're still the same hot-tempered person after all these years! Old Song, let me tell you, I've found a great talent, really amazing! You'd never guess how good he is.";
";A talent? There aren't any outstanding immortal second generations in the city. If there were any good talents, how could I not know?";
";That's exactly it, you don't know. I've been wandering around and this morning, I saw a kid at Jinshui Park. He's perfected the Shock Fist, yet managed not to achieve the Muscle and Bone Resonance.";
";Could it be that he's only seven or eight years old, with weak bones, and a heaven-defying comprehension?";
";He's a senior high school student.";
";Impossible, absolutely impossible! Old Tang, your cultivation level is stronger than mine, but you can't talk nonsense. If he's perfected the Shock Fist, then he would have definitely perfected Soft Fist and Military Boxing as well. Even if he has a weak constitution or a not-so-good family background, the school would have certainly provided him assistance once they found out. Even if he cultivates low-key, he would be able to reach Muscle and Bone Resonance. No, that's not it. You wouldn't be this happy just because he's perfected Shock Fist.";
";But that's the truth. The kid said he has just started recently. Of course, I didn't really believe him, so I made a bet with him. I demonstrated Yin Yang Fist, and if he could achieve Minor Success within a day, I'd give him a Peiyuan Pill.";
";Recently started? Such a situation isn't unheard of—a sudden enlightenment, and a great increase in comprehension. It's possible. But Old Tang, Yin Yang Fist isn't easy to practice. It contains the principles of hardness and softness, complementary and contradictory. If he achieves Minor Success in a day, it's indeed rare talent, but it wouldn't make you this happy. Could it be in half a day? If it's just half a day, you wouldn't call me over. Could it be he achieved Great Success in half a day? If that's the case, he really is a good talent.";
";You really underestimate me. If it was just half a day and Great Success, would I call you to share?";
";So go ahead and tell me, don't just drop your pants without farting!";
";Vulgar!"; Old Tang put on a serious face, ";He watched me once and understood, and after practicing ten times, he reached perfection.";
";Holy shit, that's impossible!"; Old Song was astonished, ";Are you sure he's just a senior high school student, hasn't achieved Muscle and Bone Resonance, and has never practiced Yin Yang Fist before?";
";Do you think he could deceive me?"; Old Tang snorted, ";That's not even the key point. The key is that after taking the Peiyuan Pill, he went straight to Muscle and Bone Resonance, then breakthrough to enter the Sea of Qi in his Dantian.";
";Damn, he really is a gem. It's no wonder you've gone through so much trouble, Old Tang. Did you take him as your disciple? Call him over someday so I can have a look.";
";Don't be so anxious, we're far from there yet!";
";I hope you're not telling me he's also awakened Spiritual Power. That's a one in ten thousand chance!";
";No! But when he opened his Dantian, he merged into Heaven and Earth, and directly established a two-zhang-wide Sea of Qi.";
";Merging into Heaven and Earth? A two-zhang Sea of Qi?"; Old Song shouted in surprise, his breathing quickening, ";How is this even possible? Old Tang, you've taken him as your disciple, haven't you?";
";No!";
";Holy shit, you old man, don't tell me you don't even value such a talent! If you don't take him, I will. Just tell me, who is he?";
";If I'm afraid of teaching someone wrongly, what about you?"; Old Tang snorted and then said seriously, ";Once such a genius takes off, he will soar straight up into the sky. Just keep an eye on him for the time being, try to protect him as much as possible. No matter what, he is still from Pingyang.";
The two chatted quietly.
At home.
Jiang Ming looked up a lot of information and began to memorize the content of Guiyuan Sutra and Thunderous Nine Heavens Strike in his heart, closing his eyes to sort it out.
He also began to comprehend Guiyuan Sutra.
This was the fundamental way of practicing cultivation skills.
When a martial artist breaks through to the Martial Arts Second Realm, they can merge their mind with Heaven and Earth and draw Primal qi into their bodies, a very special state.
Once the breakthrough is made, manipulating qi into the body requires cultivation skills.
After a while, Jiang Ming opened his eyes, a spark of understanding in them.
The method of absorbing elemental qi into true qi as described in the Guiyuan Sutra, he had comprehended its essence.
";But with the size of my Dantian space, filling it up with true qi is going to be very difficult!";
Not very difficult, but rather, extremely difficult.
Most of the Primal qi absorbed during the breakthrough has been used to expand the Dantian, which is now empty.
What kind of concept is ten zhang square radius?
It's a circle with a radius of thirty-three meters, no, a sphere!
As he thought about it, Jiang Ming couldn't help but feel goosebumps.
";I'll take it one step at a time!";
Sighing, he sat cross-legged on the sofa, cycling his Qi through his Dantian Sea of Qi, forming a peculiar circulation within his body, drawing the fluctuations of the surrounding Qi, and then flowing into his Dantian Sea of Qi.
At first, it was slow.
One strand at a time flowed in and was refined into true Qi in the Sea of Qi.
As he cultivated, Jiang Ming's soul vibrated, and his spirit radiated, unconsciously merging with the pulsations of Heaven and Earth, causing his body to seemingly melt into nature. His limbs, body, and every pore absorbed Qi from Heaven and Earth.
At this moment, he truly became a ravenous behemoth.
The sun set in the evening twilight.
Jiang Ming opened his eyes, a streak of intelligence flowing through them, then disappearing. ";My cultivation speed should be fast. No, not just fast, but extremely fast. But for me, it's still too slow.";
His Dantian space was too vast.
He felt his stomach, but wasn't too hungry.
That was one of the advantages of entering Martial Arts Second Realm, which allowed him to absorb the energy of Heaven and Earth for his own use, naturally reducing his need for food.
After going out to eat dinner, he began to comprehend the Wild Thunder Ninth Slash.
It wasn't difficult for him.
A silent night.
Tianwu Calendar 9918, May 28th, 9 AM.
Jiang Ming, carrying his blade, arrived in front of Ten Thousand Realms Tower.
It was a nine-story building, with the City Lord Mansion next to it. There were many martial artists coming and going, and some people were carrying weapons.
The hall on the first floor was very large.
It was similar to a leisure area, offering drinks, food, and more. Many martial artists were sitting and chatting, exchanging experiences.
On one side were several elevators, each leading to a single floor. There was also a service staff member in front of the elevator.
Jiang Ming walked towards the elevator leading to the second floor.
";Please verify your identity!"; The service girl smiled and pointed to the nearby machine.
";Alright!"; Jiang Ming took out his mobile phone, pulled up his identity information, and started to verify it. At the same time, a beam of light fell on him for scanning.
";Martial Arts Second Realm, verification passed!";
There was a prompt sound nearby, and the elevator automatically opened. Jiang Ming entered.
There were a few scattered people sitting in the spacious second floor.
A few middle-aged people looked hesitant, as if they wanted to take a risk but were very cautious.
Jiang Ming, however, unexpectedly saw someone he knew.
";Qin Zhiyan, what are you doing here?"; he walked over.
The familiar face was his Class Monitor and class flower, Miss Qin.
He was genuinely surprised.
";Jiang Ming!"; Qin Zhiyan was also surprised. Hesitating, she said, ";I want to give it a shot.";
";There's no need!"; Jiang Ming sat across from her, ";Given your situation, it's difficult for martial arts prestigious schools, but first-tier ones are still within reach. Why would you take such a risk? I've looked up some information, and most of us recently-advanced students who enter the World Secret Realm to take risks have a very high chance of dying, while the benefits are extremely rare.";
";Then why did you come!"; Qin Zhiyan said unhappily.
";I have special circumstances!"; Jiang Ming hesitated for a moment, raised his hand, and placed it on her shoulder before she could react.
Qin Zhiyan suddenly felt a heavy weight on her shoulder, as if a mountain was pressing down on her. She couldn't bear it even if she tried to resist it with her cultivation skills. Jiang Ming, on the other hand, seemed unbothered.
She immediately showed a shocked expression, her face full of disbelief: ";You, how is this possible? Didn't you just break through yesterday?";
Her voice was very low.
";Didn't I say my situation is special?"; Jiang Ming removed his hand, ";Do you have a reason to go in?";
";No, I just want to try my luck and get into a prestigious school.";
";At the cost of your life? Don't forget you have parents!";
After hearing this, Qin Zhiyan fell silent, and then bitter laughed, ";You're usually a closed-up person, but I didn't expect you to be so persuasive. Sigh, I really shouldn't have come! What about you? Do you have a reason to go in?";
";Yes!"; Jiang Ming nodded.
";You don't need to, either. Like you advised me, you can cultivate step by step, and your future achievements will definitely be impressive. Even if you have any grievances, you can easily solve them with your future status. There's no need to risk your life!";
";Since I'm here, I've made all the preparations! Qin Zhiyan, if I don't come back, bring my belongings to Wang Fatty and let him deal with them as he pleases.";
Jiang Ming stood up and walked towards the mysterious World Gate, which was only a frame and filled with darkness inside.
A middle-aged man was sitting in front of the World Gate, swiping his phone. Hearing the commotion, he raised his head and frowned upon seeing Jiang Ming: ";You're still young, do you really want to take this risk? People die there!";
";Since I came here, I'm prepared to take all the consequences!"; Jiang Ming bowed his hand, ";Please proceed with the procedure!";
";Alright!"; The middle-aged man nodded, pointing to a nearby machine, ";First, scan your identity. If it's your first time entering the World Secret Realm, it's free. Otherwise, there's a handling fee of 100,000 credit points.";
";Sign a will in case of death, and put your belongings in the locker.";
";There are ancient clothes in the room next door, and you can choose a set for free. There are also some small accessories! If you have money, you can ask the people inside to tailor-make a set for you, plus a wig.";
";Read the instruction manual before entering!";
";Let me remind you again, past experiences are not reliable because the world you enter is random and constantly developing. There may even be new World Secret Realms emerging.";
The middle-aged man said tirelessly.
Jiang Ming had already verified his identity, put his mobile phone and other items in the locker, and after hesitating for a moment, even placed his blade inside. He entered the room next door and came out after a while, wearing a set of white Confucian robes, with a jade pendant hanging from his waist, and holding a folding fan in his hand. His short hair was now long, but it was meticulously arranged so that it didn't look like a wig.
It gave people an astonishing feeling, like a peerless young master with jade-like appearance.
Qin Zhiyan, who was walking by, couldn't help but stare and take a few more glances. Then, with a serious look on her face, she asked, ";Do you really have to go?";
";I must!"; Jiang Ming smiled, ";I put my stuff in the locker. If I don't return in an hour, you take it. Anyway, I have no worries.";
With a bow of his hand, he stepped into the World Gate without hesitation. His figure disappeared without a trace.
Qin Zhiyan was lost in a daze.


CHAPTER-9
9 Chapter 9: Nine Yin and Nine Yang

Worlds differ, rules differ.
The moment Jiang Ming stepped into the World Gate, his head was slightly dizzy. Astral travelling had brought him to another one-party world, appearing beside a mountain road.
Immediately, he showed caution, observing his surroundings and carefully sensing for any dangers before relaxing a bit.
At the same time, some information about the World of Secret Realm surfaced in his mind.
The World Secret Realm that those in the Martial Arts Second Realm enter are usually second-tier secret realms. The strongest within them are at the Martial Arts Third layer, and at the most can reach the quasi-fourth layer.
This is a limitation of power.
To escape and leave the Secret Realm, and simultaneously gain all the learning, there are two known criteria that apply to most worlds: Become the acknowledged strongest in the Secret Realm World or become the Supreme of Ninety-five.
The strongest power, the strongest authority.
Other conditions depend on the specific world or the degree of evolution.
At this moment, a distorted screen appeared before his eyes, displaying lines of text.
Secret Realm: Nine Yin and Nine Yang World.
Limitations: The survival limit is three years. In the last year, the world's will repel and powerful beings of this world will sense the general location of the outsiders and hunt them down in the name of exterminating demons and protecting the Dao. Note: Only the general location can be sensed.
Exit conditions: First, persevere for three years; second, obtain five top-secret books; third, comprehend a brand-new top secret skill. Note: Completing the first condition allows you to leave at any time, but everything gained in this place will be erased.
Achievement conditions: First, become the recognized strongest; second, become the Emperor; third, comprehend a martial arts realm; fourth, obtain the Nine Yin Divine Art and Nine Yang True Scripture. Note: Achieving any of these allows you to leave at any time while keeping all non-material gains intact.
There were two grey buttons at the bottom: Leave, Achieve.
The content was actually very simple, surviving in this place for three years.
If it wasn't for the last year when the Heaven and Earth's will repelling him, and being hunted by powerful beings sensing his location in this world, there would be no difficulty.
But it's obvious, coming here is asking for trouble.
Exit conditions are difficult.
Achievement conditions are even more difficult.
";Is the intention of the World Secret Realm to cultivate and select the powerful?";
Jiang Ming pondered secretly.
Becoming the strongest or the Emperor within three years? It's as difficult as reaching the heavens. He isn't familiar with the Nine Yin and Nine Yang cultivation skills, but comprehending an entirely new realm?
That's even more difficult than becoming the Emperor.
If he reached the Third layer of martial arts and comprehended the realm, he would be equivalent to a quasi-fourth level powerhouse.
";No wonder so few people can truly benefit.";
Let alone gaining benefits, even the exit conditions are not simple.
Comprehending secret skills? For those in the Martial Arts Second Realm, it's like a fantasy. The key is that the time is too short, only two years of development before a final year of fighting.
Collecting top martial arts? Without the power of the third layer, it's very difficult to achieve.
As for achievements?
He's not too worried about that. With his comprehension, creating a new law is not difficult, at least he can get the condition to leave at any time, and stand invincible in the innate realm.
While thinking, he also examined the surrounding environment.
Below his feet was the mountain road, flanked by high mountains on the left and right.
After carefully sensing it again, he discovered something unexpected: the gravity in this world seemed lighter, no, restriction would be more accurate.
As he circulated the Guiyuan Sutra, there was no feeling of stagnation, he could continue his cultivation.
";It's just that the absorption of primal qi is slower, far less than that in the Main World. No, it's because of the low vitality concentration in this world.";
Jiang Ming couldn't help but frown.
For him, this was not good news.
";The most important thing now is to figure out the situation here.";
As Jiang Ming was considering his situation, he heard the sound of horseshoes getting closer, accompanied by laughter and conversation.
";Haha, we made a fortune this time.";
";Yeah, I didn't expect this group of merchants to have three thousand taels of silver hidden in their midst. That's enough to eat for a year.";
";Damn it, there are no women around. It's killing me. Boss, should we raid a village, kill them all, and keep the women for some fun?";
";Fun my ass. If word gets out, those other bandit groups will definitely hunt us down. They're all heartless, rotten scoundrels.";
Jiang Ming's hearing was extraordinary, which made him frown slightly.
";Robbers? No, they should be mountain bandits.";
";They even want to slaughter villages, truly evil!";
";This world isn't peaceful; otherwise, these bandits wouldn't dare to run rampant, let alone massacre villages.";
Jiang Ming shook his head, feeling somewhat uneasy.
Soon, a group of more than twenty people appeared in front, all riding horses, like a sweeping gale, roaring as they came.
He focused on their senses, and felt slightly relieved.
None of them were strong.
Even the one at the front hadn't reached the stage of communicating with the outer world through Qi, which meant they hadn't reached even Martial Arts Second Realm.
Their blood qi wasn't strong either, and in his eyes, they all had a thick killing aura, with only two of them having less.
Whinny!
The horse neighed, stopping abruptly.
";A white-faced scholar? Tsk tsk, that face is so pale, even paler than a woman's chest."; The leader at the front stared at Jiang Ming and couldn't help but lick his lips, revealing a wicked grin.
";Haha, boss, this is what you like, isn't it? Do you want us to catch him and send him to your room?";
";Get lost, with your filthy claws, don't dirty my sweetheart! I can't take it anymore. I'll peel him to have some fun!";
Jiang Ming couldn't help but shudder, tightening his buttocks.
";Sweetheart, come, come, sing that song Backyard Flower' with me!"; The leader was quite burly, but his skin was extremely rough.
He got off his horse and walked over.
";Damn it, such bad luck!"; Jiang Ming spat, feeling disgusted, ";You want to lay your hands on me? I'll take you down first!";
Without another word, he moved, shooting forward like an arrow.
Fast, very fast.
The mountain bandit leader's pupils shrank in shock, quickly retreating while trying to draw his Mountain-cutting Blade from his back. However, just as he had pulled out halfway, Jiang Ming had already arrived, landing a punch on his shoulder.
Bang
His shoulder exploded, blood and flesh flying everywhere.
His left shoulder was completely shattered.
The mountain bandit leader screamed as he was sent flying backward, crashing in front of a horse and spitting out a mouthful of blood. He hurriedly yelled, ";This brat is tough! All of you, attack!";
Being hardened criminals, they all jumped up and charged forward.
The blades whistled, faces ferocious.
Jiang Ming's eyes narrowed, causing their speed to slow down a bit, as he exhaled a foul breath and attacked again.
His fists were like dragons, accompanied by thunder and lightning.
Bang
With a single punch, he turned the closest attacker and his weapon into a bloody mist, causing the remaining bandits to pause, then shriek in horror and fear.
Even Jiang Ming was surprised, but he didn't stop.
He alternated between Military Boxing and Domineering Boxing, like a wolf among sheep. In just a short time, everyone else, except for the two who hadn't dismounted, lay on the ground.
The horses neighed in pain and anguish.
Jiang Ming looked at the last two.
";Hero, please spare us!"; One of them, an elder with a goatee, and small, rolling eyes fell to his knees after rolling off his horse. ";This old man has not committed any evil, please spare my life!";
The other one was a young man, who bowed with a clenched fist, cautious yet fearful, with a hint of satisfaction.
";Interesting!"; Jiang Ming laughed.


CHAPTER-10
10 Chapter 10: Great Village Master

Someone behind him seemed to see an opportunity, forcibly suppressing the pain from his severed arm, and pulled out a dagger, pouncing at his waist.
Thud
Jiang Ming didn't look back; with a slight twist of his body, he sent his opponent flying. The man landed far away, his chest completely collapsed.
The bearded goat old man trembled and grew even more respectful.
";What's your name? Why didn't you take action?"; Jiang Ming asked.
Before the man could answer, the previous leader yelled angrily, ";Hu Laosan, are you fucking betraying me? Did you find these people? Screw your ancestors!";
Hu Laosan's mouth twitched slightly, but he ignored his leader and instead respectfully said to Jiang Ming, ";Hero, I am Hu Tu, the third-ranked leader of the Three Villages, known as Hu Laosan. I was originally a scholar who knew a bit of martial arts. One year, I was framed and had no choice but to run away. I was caught and brought up the mountain, and since I was versed in both literature and martial arts, I was made the third leader. I didn't want to do it, I really didn't, but even a tiny ant clings to life, so I could only follow the flow.";
";But, hero, I've never actively taken someone's life!"; Hu Laosan pleaded earnestly.
";What about you?"; Jiang Ming looked at the young man.
";My grandfather was a mountain bandit, and my father was a mountain bandit. After our village was destroyed, I was captured and brought here. I had no choice but to become a mountain bandit, but I don't want to be one, and I don't want my son to become one either,"; the young man said a bit excitedly. ";My name is Chang Qing, and I've always wanted to leave the mountain village but never had the chance.";
";I can testify to that!"; Hu Laosan hurriedly said, ";He can't stand people killing each other, so he's been ostracized by his fellow mountain thieves. However, his skills are exceptional, and he's always chosen to accompany them on missions, but he avoids taking action when possible. If it weren't for my covert support, he would surely suffer at the hands of Big Boss Ma.";
Jiang Ming remained noncommittal but asked, ";You want to live or die?";
";Live! Of course, I want to live!"; Hu Laosan said, ";Ahem, I may not be a good person, but I don't think I'm a bad person either. At least not intentionally.";
Jiang Ming couldn't help but laugh out loud.
As expected of a scholar, eloquent with his words.
";Go and kill Big Boss Ma, and kill all those you think are incorrigible. I'll spare your lives!"; Jiang Ming pointed at the severely injured Ma bandit leader.
Hu Laosan hesitated slightly, stood up, and drew his knife to walk over.
But Chang Qing was even faster, stabbing his knife directly into Big Boss Ma's heart. Hu Laosan also gave a stab, and amidst unwillingness and pain, Big Boss Ma died with his eyes wide open.
The two men killed several more people before stopping.
";The remaining people are basically not evil, they were all forced!"; Hu Laosan's voice was faint, and he crouched down.
";Fine!"; Jiang Ming nodded and looked at Chang Qing. ";You go and bandage them up, but they can't run away; whoever runs away will die. Then dispose of the bodies. Hu Laosan, come here!";
Jiang Ming gestured to the front.
Hu Laosan had no choice but to follow.
";I just left my clan, wandering through the mountains and rivers, observing the world, honing my martial arts, and also learning about the customs of the people in various parts of the world."; Jiang Ming stated a brief, vague origin before asking, ";Tell me about the surrounding situation.";
";Yes!"; Hu Laosan breathed a sigh of relief upon learning that the youth was a member of a prominent clan. ";This is Black Cloud Mountain. There are several bandit hideouts on the surrounding mountains: Black Wind Village, where I am; Black Dragon Village, Black Saber Village, and Black Tiger Village.";
The four villages had similar strengths and had been fighting overtly and covertly. They all had one commonality: they engaged in banditry and carried out all sorts of evil deeds. At one time, the four villages had even collaborated to discuss attacking a nearby county town.
";No wonder they're so wild!"; Jiang Ming couldn't help but blurt out.
";Sigh!"; Hu Laosan sighed, ";The emperor is incompetent and corrupt, selling official positions, and the court is dark. High and low officials collude together, their hearts turning black like maggots. The common people have nothing to live on, especially last year's flood in Jiangzhou, which displaced countless people. The court not only failed to provide relief but also prevented people from fleeing the disaster. It was a tragedy! In the first half of this year, Yunzhou suffered a severe drought, and some people even resorted to cannibalism. Sigh";
Jiang Ming's eyebrows twitched as he listened.
 ";Clan powers grow, dividing lands and nations.";
 ";Noble families divide territory amongst themselves, creating countries within the country.";
 ";Bandits roam the land, leaving a trail of woe.";
 ";Sigh, the common people's suffering is great. Many people were forced to join the ranks of bandits out of desperation.";,
Jiang Ming couldn't help but express his thoughts: ";Prosperity brings suffering to the people; decline brings suffering to the people.";
Hu Laosan's eyes lit up: ";The young master has such literary talent!";
Jiang Ming continued to ask questions and gradually learned more about this world.
The Great Yan Dynasty ruled the world, with the northern barbarians known as Beimang, which used to be insignificant, now posed a great threat.
The three hundred year-old dynasty had declined and was nearing its end.
In the world of martial artists, the prominent sects included the Dalin Temple, Zhen Wu Sect, Chunyang Sect, Lengyue Palace, Divine Sword Villa, Sun and Moon Demon Sect, and Divine Fist Sect.
The Sun and Moon Demon Sect once stirred up the martial world, and although they are low-key now, they remain very powerful.
The martial world is still divided into good and evil factions.
The martial arts realm is rather peculiar, divided into: Not Ranked, Third-tier, Second-tier, First-tier, Innate, Grandmaster, and Great Grandmaster.
Not Ranked' are those who know some basic martial arts techniques, like farmers.
At the Initial stage, one cultivates their qi; opening up the Dantian and the Sea of Qi makes one a Third-tier practitioner, unblocking all twelve meridians elevates one to the Second-tier, and opening up the extraordinary vessels makes one a First-tier practitioner.
Breaking through the Governor and Conception vessels and absorbing the power of Heaven and Earth transforms one's true Qi into that of an Innate warrior.
";As for Grandmasters and Great Grandmasters, I'm not sure!"; Hu Laosan shook his head. He looked slightly puzzled: why would someone ask about such common knowledge?
He didn't think too much about it.
Jiang Ming's expression was quite strange.
In the Main World, cultivation starts with refining the body and directly drawing the breath of heaven and earth into the body to open up the Dantian, with Qi circulating throughout the body, and the strength leaving the body. There is no need to open up meridians.
But here, the process starts from the inside out, requiring the opening of the twelve meridians and the Eight Extraordinary Meridians, only after stepping into the Innate realm can one absorb the Primal Qi of Heaven and Earth.
";In the Main World, all the meridians are opened, which can directly save the process of opening meridians and directly draw the energy of Heaven and Earth into the body, equivalent to the Innate here. Starting from Innate, because the Primal Qi is violent, a powerful body is required to withstand it, which results in the Bone Forging Realm?";
Jiang Ming speculated in secret.
However, to be sure, he needs to find the cultivation skills of this world and verify them through textual research.
";Is the Bone Forging Realm equivalent to Third-tier, Second-tier, and First-tier? Is the Qi Sea Realm equivalent to Innate, and the Martial Arts Realm of the Third Layer of Gang Qi equivalent to Grandmaster?";
Jiang Ming suppressed the idea.
He would look for an opportunity to explore it thoroughly later on.
";Come on, follow me to Black Wind Village!";
He made a decision.
";To Black Wind Village?"; Hu Laosan was momentarily stunned.
";I want to be a Village Master and play, also leading you to change from evil to good, finding a way for you to live!"; Jiang Ming laughed, ";Go, lead the way.";
";Okay, okay!"; Hu Laosan nodded in amazement.
Being a Village Master just for fun?
Changing from evil to good?
If changing from evil to good could provide a way to survive, who would become a mountain thief?
Chang Qing was also a bit confused, he thought they would be released and leave the mountain village to wander around the world.
But they were still going up the mountain.
Dammit!
";Young Master, now the second Village Master is on the mountain, and there is also the junior Village Master. I have no say in it. I usually just give advice and manage food and drink issues."; Hu Laosan whispered.
";My surname is Jiang, you can call me Great Village Master from now on. As for the two of them? Leave them to me!"; Jiang Ming waved his hand, and he jumped onto a horse, ";Go!";
He could ride a horse.
It is a required course for students in the Main World, so basically, everyone knows it.
It didn't take long for them to arrive at the foot of the mountain village.
Hu Laosan was in the lead, Jiang Ming followed behind.
";Third Boss, you're back. Where is the big boss?";
The mountain thief guarding the village gate asked.
";The big boss has something to do and told me to come back first. Watch the door carefully, or you'll be robbed!"; Hu Laosan patted the other's shoulder and continued up the mountain.
Without any accidents, they directly arrived outside Juyi Hall, where the second boss and the junior Village Master had already come out.
";Hu Laosan, where's the big boss?"; The second boss was fat and disdainful of Hu Laosan, just slanting his eyes to ask.
";Didn't you bring me a few young girls?"; The junior Village Master was also full of resentment.
";The big boss is waiting for you. As for the young girls?"; Jiang Ming walked forward, revealing a hint of coldness.
";You brat, it's not your place to speak here!"; The second Village Master glared and was about to take action.
Overbearing and domineering.
Slap
Jiang Ming stepped forward, a roundhouse kick sent his opponent flying before he could react, crashing into a nearby stone wall. His face was a mess of blood and brain matter.
The bewildered Junior Village Master was also sent flying, dying on the spot.
The others began to stir restlessly.
";Brothers, be quiet, be quiet!"; Hu Laosan knew it was time for him to show up and waved his hand, shouting, ";Ma Guang is a tyrant, the second boss is cruel, and the Junior Village Master always beats and scolds us, even killing us and taking our wives if he's unhappy. I've had enough. But under their cruel threats, we can only endure. Now, our savior is here, I have invited Young Master Jiang, who killed the big boss, and wiped out the second boss and Junior Village Master, saving us from the fire and water, and helping us in times of crisis. He can be regarded as our rebirth parents.";
";From today, Young Master Jiang is our Great Village Master, our sky, our king!";
";He will bring us good food and drink and teach us the real martial arts skills.";
";Everyone, follow me to pay homage to the Great Village Master!";
Without further ado, Hu Tu knelt down on one knee.
Many brothers hesitated, but many smart guys knew that the times changed, they better be smart and also knelt down one by one.
";Hu Laosan, you traitor"; One of them was furious, but before he could finish, he was stabbed from behind by Chang Qing.


CHAPTER-11
11 Chapter 11: Capturing Them All in One Go

No surprises.
Jiang Ming became the Great Village Master of Black Wind Village.
He sat in the top position in Juyi Hall, making Hu Tu the new Second Brother Hu and Chang Qing the Chang Laosan.
";Pick out those who have committed evil deeds and were loyal to the previous village leader, kill them all!"; Jiang Ming issued his first order, ";Second Brother Hu, be serious about it! From now on, we will not rob common people and merchants. If we want to take action, we will target local tyrants, corrupt officials, understood?";
";Understood, understood, understood!"; Second Brother Hu nodded like garlic and hurried away.
";Chang Laosan, after Second Brother Hu has cleaned up, you pick a group of capable brothers to form a team that will train day and night. Can you do it?";
";Great Village Master, I can!";
Chang Qing regained his fighting spirit.
Whether it's becoming the Third Fortress Leader or changing the style of the mountain village in the future, it all appeals to him, so he is naturally very happy.
Jiang Ming nodded.
Second Brother Hu was a cunning man, although he was greedy for life and afraid of death, such people were easy to control. As long as you were strong, he would do his job seriously.
Chang Laosan, on the other hand, was a young man with some decisiveness. With more encouragement and utilization, plus guidance in values, he could be developed into a good helper.
After they left, Jiang Ming paced around the hall.
Although the environment was average and the furniture was worn, he felt a sense of accomplishment.
In fact, when he first arrived, the prompt said he would be fighting demons and protecting the way of life, and then he had an idea when he saw a group of mountain thieves passing by.
It was better to train a group of people for the battle two years later, at the very least, they could be used as cannon fodder.
And so, he seized the opportunity and succeeded.
Having handed over the chores to the two, he was now at leisure.
The dinner was average, and after filling his belly, he went to his newly cleaned residence. It was a small courtyard with a girl aged about sixteen or seventeen arranged to take care of his daily life.
Her name was Lan, and she looked pale and trembling when she saw him, apparently frightened.
Jiang Ming sighed inwardly.
In the Main World, these were students!
Suppressing the discomfort in his heart, he went inside. In the bedroom, there was a makeshift bookshelf, filled with many books, mostly worn-out, which he had requested.
Most of them were ordinary books, and there were only five cultivation skills: Ma's Spiritual Mindset Skill, Stele-Breaking Palm, Iron Fist, Wind-Breaking Blade Skill, and Skill of Grass Flying.
There were not many cultivation skills, but they were well-rounded.
";Ma's Spiritual Mindset Skill?"; Jiang Ming had a strange feeling as he read the twisted and crooked words on it. It seemed like the last Great Village Master was trying to give himself a gold medal.
He flipped through the books one by one.
Both the boxing and palm techniques were very average, and even the blade technique was simplistic.
However, the Skill of Grass Flying was interesting, as it required the Qi to circulate along a specific path in order to exert its power.
";As for Ma's Spiritual Mindset Skill?"; Jiang Ming shook his head after reading it.
Although it could cultivate internal energy, it was obvious that it transformed food into acquired Qi, which were inefficient compared to the Guiyuan Sutra.
After reading all of them and pondering for a short time, he quickly grasped the essence of the skills and integrated them into his knowledge.
";The mountain village is just too small after all!";
Jiang Ming was not disappointed and began to browse through other books.
Most of them were miscellaneous records and some storybooks, with little value.
";Wait!";
Jiang Ming's brows suddenly furrowed.
The language here was exactly the same as in the Main World, even the fonts.
Thoughts swirling, he eventually did not think too much about it.
";Thinking too much will turn me bald!";
Jiang Ming sat cross-legged on the bed and began cultivating the Guiyuan Sutra, which was the most important thing.
As the Qi circulated, his spirit vibrated and quickly harmonized with Heaven and Earth, attracting primal qi from the surroundings, transforming it into Innate Qi, and filling the vast dantian space.
This was bound to be a long process.
The next morning.
After morning class and breakfast, Second Brother Hu arrived in a hurry and respectfully said, ";Great Village Master, did you sleep well and eat well?";
";Not bad!"; Jiang Ming pointed at the stool, letting the other party sit down, ";How's the situation handled?";
";Everything that should be handled has been dealt with, although people are restless, it's also suppressed. Chang Laosan has selected a group of strong men, there won't be any trouble. However"; Second Brother Hu hesitated, ";The situation here must be hidden, I'm afraid the other three villages will come to make trouble.";
";Don't be afraid!"; Jiang Ming said indifferently.
It was this calmness and composure that made Second Brother Hu admire him even more.
He's indeed a descendant of a great family.
";Do you think if I invite the three village masters of the other villages on behalf of my becoming the Great Village Master, will they come?"; Jiang Ming asked.
";This"; Second Brother Hu was slightly startled, then hurriedly advised, ";Great Village Master, absolutely not. The mountain is now very empty, we should conserve our energy. Otherwise, they might come and take advantage when they see our weakness and strike.";
Jiang Ming stretched out his palm, flicked his finger, and shot out a strand of Qi that turned into a blade, piercing a hole through the stone table.
Second Brother Hu was stunned then trembled, revealing a look of ecstasy: ";Great Village Master, have you reached the Innate Realm?";
";Are you still afraid now?"; Jiang Ming didn't answer but asked instead.
";Not afraid, of course not afraid."; Second Brother Hu's spirits were greatly boosted, ";In front of the Innate Realm, they are all nothing. Great Village Master, you want to invite them over, and then catch them all in one net?";
";Yes! You go arrange it.";
";Alright! But let's first wait for the mountain to be sorted out, arrangements made, and without any worries. Half a month at most.";
";Alright! Second Brother Hu, later on, bring all the medicines from the mountain to me, so I can cultivate!";
";Great Village Master, I'll go arrange it right away!";
Second Brother Hu left in a hurry, but he couldn't help but feel emotional: Such a young age, Innate realm, and still cultivating diligently, his background must be extraordinary. The key is that he can listen to opinions, truly fortunate! Perhaps, I can still make something of my career.
It didn't take long for him to personally deliver a batch of medicine supplies, but they were all very ordinary.
The oldest ginseng was only a hundred years old.
";Lan!";
";Young Master, your servant is here!";
";I'll say this, listen carefully!";
Jiang Ming picked out some medicinal materials and sorted them out, explaining to Lan how to cook them into a medicinal meal. This was also a high school course.
Medicinal material combinations, how to cook simple nutritious medicinal meals, and so on.
Now that he had an assistant, he naturally didn't want to do it himself.
";You try it first, and if there's anything wrong, I'll guide you!";
";Yes, Young Master!";
Young Master was what he requested to be called.
Being called the Great Village Master by a delicate young girl sounded very awkward.
Lan learned the steps, cooking sequence, and cooking time in just two attempts and remembered it all in her heart.
Jiang Ming didn't pay any more attention, he stepped forward, and unfolded his light skill. In Lan's eyes, he seemed to turn into a shadow, getting faster and faster.
This shocked her greatly, and she also revealed a look of awe and envy.
Jiang Ming stepped on the grass, running without his feet touching the ground, each step covering five to six meters, as light as a cloud.
This was the true meaning of the Skill of Grass Flying, being able to run on the tips of the grass.
";Perfection!";
After the excitement, he returned to the courtyard.
He looked up at the sky.
";When will I be able to fly?";
Thinking about this, Jiang Ming couldn't help but laugh.
While cultivating, he also considered the situation on the mountain. Although he wanted to train a group of cannon fodder, rules must be established; otherwise, people's hearts would not be aligned, and it would be easy to collapse in case of trouble.
";For mountain thieves, it's almost impossible to make them loyal and devoted in a short period of time.";
";So, with a powerful deterrent strength, using interest as the lead, and high-intensity training as the core, with ideological education, we strive to create a group of iron soldiers!";
Jiang Ming had a simple plan and wrote down some provisions.
In the evening, when Second Brother Hu came over, he showed it to him.
";Great Village Master, if we implement this, the brothers on the mountain will definitely be united and devoted, but"; Second Brother Hu also showed a troubled expression, ";It's too expensive, and the mountain village simply cannot afford it.";


CHAPTER-12
12 Chapter 12: Dragon Elephant Dominator Body

Money?
Not a problem.
The plan was temporarily suppressed. It wasn't time for implementation yet, but Second Brother Hu was instructed to be mentally prepared.
Life on the mountain was simple, after all, they didn't work for a living.
In the dim night, the moon hung high in the sky.
Jiang Ming sipped tea while contemplating his cultivation.
The Qi Sea Realm was simple. It required filling the dantian with Qi while also circulating it throughout the body, radiating to the internal organs, muscles, and skin, allowing the body to adapt to the Qi while also refining it to better control its characteristics.
As long as it was mobilized, it could flow to any part of the body in an instant.
This was a slow process.
";Third layer of martial arts, Gang Qi Realm.";
Jiang Ming was already well aware of this realm. Waiting for the Sea of Qi to overflow, and after freely using the Qi, he would then start to comprehend the nature of the Qi metamorphosis.
In simple terms, it meant allowing the Qi to undergo metamorphosis, having effects like condensing the Qi into a weapon, wrapping it around, or creating an armor to protect the body, etc.
True Qi Metamorphosis, Realm upgrade.
He closed his eyes and began cultivating.
The essence contained in the medicinal meal was rapidly released and absorbed during the cultivation, greatly speeding up the Qi transformation.
Early in the morning the next day, he went to the quiet place in the Back Mountain for cultivation. Soft Fist, Military Boxing, Shock Fist, Yin Yang Fist, and the Stele-Breaking Palm, Iron Fist, which he had just learned, were practiced one by one. The coordination and exchange of the moves were seamless.
With his powerful comprehension and control of his body, after practicing for countless times, it was as if he had been cultivating for decades.
His moves were as natural as an antelope hanging its horns without leaving a trace.
Jiang Ming paused slightly, his body slightly bent, and then burst out. He stepped on the weeds or traveled through the branches like a nimble ape but faster than a flying bird.
In the blink of an eye, he came to a stop and pulled out the long blade from his back.
This was a specific blade he had chosen, a cross-cutting blade, black and sharp, and had a rather vulgar name: Black Saber.
Hum
Thunderstorm Nine Slashes was executed. It was like thunder falling from the sky, wild and fierce, each move was full of fierceness and ruthlessness, filled with the intense decisiveness of a dominant power.
The blade light changed, and the Qi flowed out, unexpectedly spraying out a more than ten meters long saber Qi, cutting the rock ahead into two halves with one slash.
This was the Thunderstorm Nine Slashes.
";It's not far from reaching a range of forty meters with the Qi!";
It's not impossible, but the control of Qi was insufficient.
As the blade technique unfolded, cutting through the air, and the Qi flowed arbitrarily.
In the end, the flowing Qi was only an addition to the long blade, with an inch of blade light shimmering. This was a highly condensed effect, with even more terrifying destructive power.
Jiang Ming's life was as plain as water.
Guiyuan Sutra, this cultivation skill, was a compulsory course in the morning, noon, and evening. In addition, he practiced combat skills and refined Qi every day.
Other times, he would wander around the mountain, interact with different people, get to know the situation here in detail, and further understand the information from the outside world.
Jiang Ming no longer showed off his powerful strength. Instead, he was very friendly. With his youthful appearance and scholarly demeanor combined with the fact that some of the unruly mountain thieves were dissatisfied or even provocative towards him, he didn't mind.
In the blink of an eye, a half month passed by.
";Great Village Master, I am a little nervous!"; In the small courtyard, Hu Laosan was somewhat excited.
He had already sent out his invitations as the new village master to celebrate and invite them to the ceremony, and he had received replies, saying that they would come today.
";What you should be nervous about is how you're going to easily take over all three villages after I kill them all,"; Jiang Ming said with a smile.
Nervous?
Just a bit.
";I've already come up with several plans, Great Village Master. Don't worry; I'll easily take over!"; Second Brother Hu's face lit up with hope and excitement, as he was being entrusted with an important task.
At the foot of the mountain.
Three groups of people converged together.
Each group had more than a dozen people with powerful Killing Qi and dense Blood Qi, making them formidable opponents at a single glance.
They were the leaders and elite members of Black Dragon Village, Black Saber Village, and Black Tiger Village.
";Old Ma got himself killed, his son is dead, and the village was robbed. It's hilarious. When I heard the news, I drank three jars of wine and laughed for a quarter of an hour.";
";Haha, me too! That guy was ruthless and always showed me no respect, I'm glad he got slaughtered. I heard the new Great Village Master is an outsider; is he the Overlord who crossed the river?";
";It must be an Overlord; otherwise, how dare he invite the three of us to the mountain at the same time? This is not just bold, but arrogant. Humph, Overlord? He still has to bow to me. Gentlemen, isn't this a delicious dish, are you interested?";
";Since we have exchanged messages and came here together, isn't it because we all want to share it?";
";What if there's a trap on the mountain?";
";A trap? Black Tiger, you old man, you are always cautious. We all brought our elites; even if it's a trap, we can still crush the entire Black Wind Village. Let's go!";
";Let's go!";
";When I level the Black Wind Village, I'll sleep with Ma Guang's woman, even if he's gone to hell, I'll still cuckold him.";
";Count me in!";
";Me too!";
Dozens of people went up the mountain without any hindrance.
They swaggered straight to the Juyi Hall.
";No banquet, yet a large number of people have surrounded us."; The leader of Black Dragon Village revealed a cold smile and looked at Jiang Ming, ";So, you are the little bastard who became the village master? Wanting to capture all of us in one fell swoop? I've seen the arrogant ones, but I've never seen anyone as crazy as you. Do you really think you're a powerful dragon that can cross the river? You're nothing but a little snake. Gentlemen, after a while, I'll personally twist off his head, take it home to stew, and use his skull to make a chamber pot. I want to piss in his head every day, so that he can carry some of my wisdom with him in his next life.";
Jiang Ming's face immediately turned black. But he didn't rush to take action.
He looked at Second Brother Hu.
This man was very nervous. Even though he knew how powerful their Great Village Master was and even though the brothers from the mountain villages had all gathered around, he couldn't help being nervous.
After all, there were three village masters in front of him, and they were all elite among the elite, notorious, and very ruthless.
Second Brother Hu swallowed his saliva, pretended to be calm, and puffed up his chest before starting to give orders.
";Good!"; Jiang Ming took note of a few people, pulled out the Black Saber from behind him, ";I'll give you a chance to live, kneel and submit!";
";Submit my ass!"; The big boss of Black Dragon Village had a violent temper and walked forward with narrowed eyes, also pulling out his Mountain-cutting Blade from behind him, ";You little brat, how dare you act big in front of me? I've decided, I'll break your four limbs first, then throw you into a pigpen and sexually excite them. No, I'll find a group of male donkeys.";
";You're ruthless!"; Jiang Ming gasped for air and couldn't help raising his thumb, then coldly said, ";Submission is just a humiliation for you! So if you don't want to continue polluting my ears, just go die!";
Thunderstorm Nine Slashes.
Die!
Jiang Ming took a step forward, and his Black Saber chopped down.
";You actually dared to fight, for that, I admire you!"; The big boss of Black Saber Village sneered, ";I haven't been defeated for hundreds of miles around, and today I'll let you see my skills.";
But feeling the terror of Jiang Ming's blade, his face drastically changed.
This slash frightened him.
The Mountain-cutting Blade changed into a defensive stance.
Bang
The next moment, his face showed horror.
A terrifying power came through, and before he could react, his Mountain-cutting Blade was broken into two pieces.
";He has Qi flowing on the blade? He's an Innate!";
As the thought flashed by, he saw the blade light enveloping his eyes, and then darkness filled his eyes, falling into the desperate darkness.
The big boss of Black Dragon Village was cut in half along with his blade.
The others were all stunned.
This big village master's strength was indeed top-notch, having already reached the peak of second-tier, and it was only a fine line away from the first-tier.
He was killed just like that?
Jiang Ming didn't give them time to think and continued to kill.
His speed was unparalleled, and his blade light flickered, completely slaughtering one-sidedly.
Even the other men didn't make a move, just surrounding them to prevent escape.
Soon, only six people remained horrified and trembling, shaking while standing. As for the others, all were killed.
";Great Village Master, mighty!"; Second Brother Hu reacted the fastest, suppressing the shock and elation in his heart, and shouted while waving his fist.
";Great Village Master, mighty!"; The other men looked at Jiang Ming with great enthusiasm, also shouting out.
";Great Village Master, mighty!";
The sound shook the sky and echoed among the mountains.
Jiang Ming raised his hand, and the sound stopped abruptly.
He forcefully suppressed the discomfort in his heart and looked at the remaining six people with a sword-like gaze, ";Do you know why you're not dead?";
Without waiting for their answer, he continued, ";Because you have committed fewer killings, there is still room for redemption, and that's why I spared your lives.";
";Is it submission or death?";
Jiang Ming spun his long blade, and the blade's aura was uncertain. This was a clear sign that he was an Innate powerhouse.
";I pay my respects to the Great Village Master; my life is now yours!";
Without much hesitation, they all knelt down.
For mountain thieves, there isn't much loyalty. It's natural to follow whoever is stronger.
";A wise man knows when to submit."; Jiang Ming nodded and instructed, ";Old Second, Old Third, you watch and arrange for the three mountains to be taken down as soon as possible.";
";Yes!"; Second Brother Hu and Chang Laosan bowed and saluted.
Jiang Ming returned to his residence.
";Young Master, the hot water is ready!"; As she arrived at the small courtyard, Lan saw Jiang Ming covered in blood, her body trembling slightly as she quickly came over to help him take off his coat.
";Don't be afraid, I won't eat you!"; Jiang Ming laughed and went into the house to take a bath.
Lan hesitated for a while before entering the room, her face flushed like blood, her voice as soft as a mosquito, ";Young Master, let me let me wash you!";
Jiang Ming felt a burst of heat from his lower abdomen rushing straight to his forehead, but forcibly suppressed it: ";No need!";
Lan sighed in relief and left.
His heart was restless and irritable.
More than ten days later.
";Great Village Master, you've really made me tired!"; Hu Laosan relaxed more and became more casual, ";Taking over three mountain villages, sorting them out, and integrating them, my old bones are almost falling apart.";
";This is called the talented bear more work!"; Jiang Ming said with a smile.
Second Brother Hu was quite satisfied, stroking his goatee, ";Great Village Master, as you instructed, the ones who were to be killed have been killed, the ones who were to be let go have been let go. The money and food have all been moved over. Village No.2 became a training ground, and Village No.3 was cleared, Village No.4 was used as a horse farm.";
";In addition, all the books have been moved into the study.";
";Various medicines have also been transported over!";
";What will you instruct next?";
Second Brother Hu asked.
Jiang Ming had a plan already. In the future, Village No.1 would become a logistical base, with Second Brother Hu in charge.
The newly subdued villages had buried their wicked followers and released the people they had previously plundered. Those who were willing to leave were given some money, while those who were willing to stay joined the village.
";You are in charge of dispatching here. I will go to Village No.2 to specially train the elite brothers, improve their strength, and announce new rules."; Jiang Ming said, with a thought in his heart, ";You set up a school so that the children on the mountain can study, read to gain wisdom, understanding, and loyalty to the village.";
";Thank you, Great Village Master!"; Second Brother Hu was immediately excited, even more excited than taking over the three villages, and his eyes were even a little moist.
";Alright, go arrange it, don't tire yourself out, and find several assistants!"; Jiang Ming waved his hand.
Second Brother Hu bowed in salute and retreated out of the room.
Jiang Ming entered the study, which was specially built in the small courtyard. It was not large but adequate.
";This is the real treasure trove!";
For him, the integration of the village was just a trivial matter.
Acquiring knowledge and collecting cultivation skills was the most important thing.
He began to flip through the books one by one.
";This one is actually a pure bodybuilding method!"; Jiang Ming flipped through one book and was a little surprised, ";Longxiang Dominator Body Skill? What an arrogant and domineering name.";


CHAPTER-13
13 Chapter 13: Six Meridians Divine Sword

The Longxiang Dominator Body Skill is an incomplete technique with only four layers of cultivation methods.
Jiang Ming quickly flipped through them.
";Toughening the body, comprehensively enhancing the resilience, strength, and power of the skin, muscles, bones, organs, etc.";
After memorizing it, he temporarily set it aside.
There were also twenty-seven other cultivation skills, mainly from the former Black Dragon Village. Although most of them were ordinary, they still broadened Jiang Ming's horizons.
Enriching his foundation and increasing his accumulation of knowledge.
Lying in bed, he carefully sorted through the cultivation skills he had observed and considered them in detail, giving him a more intuitive understanding of the cultivation path in this world.
Early the next morning.
After cultivating the Guiyuan Sutra, Jiang Ming drank a bowl of ginseng tea and began to try cultivating the Longxiang Dominator Body Skill. He felt his skin becoming denser, and his bones and muscles showed signs of further improvement.
Even his internal organs showed some strengthening.
He quickly succeeded in cultivating the first layer.
";Is it because my body is inherently strong that I achieved this easily?";
Jiang Ming didn't think too much about it.
His physical body was indeed powerful. Whether it was the Bone Forging Realm or the cleansing of his marrow from the feedback of opening the Sea of Qi, it had made his body far superior to others.
Continuing to cultivate.
With his powerful mental control combined with the vast and boundless supply of Qi nourishing his body, he unknowingly entered the state of Merge into Heaven and Earth while cultivating and absorbed the energy of Heaven and Earth to provide a source of strength for his body, allowing him to cultivate at an inconceivable speed.
By noon.
";The third layer is complete!";
";My strength has increased nearly twice!";
";Skin like leather, flesh like rope, tendons like collapsed bowstrings, bones as hard as steel!";
Jiang Ming was quite surprised.
Pinching his arm, its toughness was astonishing, even stronger than a black bear's skin, as if he was wearing a layer of soft armor.
He also had a realization.
It would be difficult to improve quickly once his past foundation was exhausted.
For the next few days, Jiang Ming spent his time cultivating and even tried to create new techniques. He managed to create a few, but they were far from being top-tier techniques.
After all, his experience was too limited.
One day, he came to Mountain No. 2. Here, three hundred chosen elite young men had been reshuffled by Chang Qing and were being trained.
When Jiang Ming arrived, he issued several orders, such as making them full-time soldiers with a minimum monthly salary of two hundred coins, which would increase with their strength; they had to engage in mandatory daily drills, shouting loyalty to the village and the Great Village Master before eating; those with children would receive free education in the village; if they died in battle, the village would support their wives and children, and so on.
With incentives and no concerns, their enthusiasm was ignited. Furthermore, they were divided into ten teams, issued cultivation skills, and competed in martial arts once a month. The wages of the winning team members would be increased by fifty percent in the following month.
Jiang Ming also trained with them, running around the mountain peak and carrying heavy loads up the mountain.
Half a year later, at the Back Mountain.
The night sky was filled with stars.
";The outside world is too vast. I'm afraid"; Second Brother Hu hesitated.
";We have to venture out eventually. As you said, the outside world is vast, but by comparison, this place is too small."; Jiang Ming stood with his hands behind his back, facing the blowing mountain wind.
There were only two of them here.
Today, in the early morning, he asked Chang Qing to lead two hundred elite warriors into the depths of the mountains, cross the mountain ranges, and continue through the Dragon Spine Mountain, which stretches thousands of miles.
This was a test of cultivation, a trial, and an attempt to seize wealth.
In just half a year, all the initial wealth had been nearly exhausted.
Jiang Ming had also reached his limit and prepared to venture out to make arrangements for the future. At the same time, he left behind a hundred elite guards to protect the village out of his unwillingness to let go.
";Will you be coming back?"; Second Brother Hu hesitated, but finally asked.
He had always felt that the Great Village Master had a sense of alienation from the village, coupled with his mysterious background, he had long guessed that the other party would leave.
But this day came too quickly, leaving him very confused.
";Maybe!"; Jiang Ming said faintly, ";I will leave this place to you. If I can't come back, let the village become a real village and live peacefully. With the strength of the mountain, you will be able to protect yourselves. Of course, if everything goes well, I will come back, and Chang Qing and his companions will return.";
Second Brother Hu let out a bitter smile.
At this moment, Jiang Ming's eyes narrowed as he saw a white figure speeding towards them from a distance. The figure stepped on the tree branches as if riding the wind, but when he got closer, his breathing became disordered and he fell to the ground.
";Damn it!"; A voice came, accompanied by a helpless sigh.
Following that, another figure arrived and landed beside them.
";Lu Paopao, why did you stop running?"; The newcomer was a stern-faced middle-aged man who glanced at Jiang Ming and Second Brother Hu with cold indifference that sent shivers down their spines.
";My name is Lu Yuan, not Lu Paopao. Damn it, why can't you remember?"; Lu Yuan cursed, seemingly unafraid of life and death.
He stood up, brushed himself off, and viciously stood in front of Jiang Ming and Second Brother Hu.
";Ever since I met you, you've been running away non-stop. If I don't call you Lu Paopao, what should I call you?"; The middle-aged man slowly approached, a powerful aura surrounding him which caused Second Brother Hu's breathing to falter and his face to turn pale.
";Wait!"; Lu Yuan raised his hand to stop him. ";Our grudges have nothing to do with these two. What if we let them go and walk away?";
";You think I will let them go?";
";Tan Feng, you claim to be a grandmaster of the Demonic Sect, an elder"; Lu Yuan started speaking and then slapped himself, spitting out a mouthful of blood. ";Right, you're an elder of the Demonic Sect. The Demonic Sect always kills indiscriminately. I can't believe I was even trying to plead with you. Damn, I'm screwed. Just drinking in a brothel and accidentally stumbling into your mess. Hey, hey, hey, you two are unlucky too, being implicated by me. Later, I will fight him to the death, and you two should try to escape. If you can't escape, don't blame me as a ghost, because I will definitely go first.";
";Indeed, Lu Paopao is righteous, even for strangers he doesn't want to involve them. Unfortunately, tonight none of you will escape!"; Tan Feng suddenly attacked, his palms flipping and his true Qi surging, forcefully blasting Lu Yuan away.
";Die!";
With a flick of his finger, Tan Feng projected two streams of Sword Qi towards Jiang Ming and Second Brother Hu, clearly planning to silence them both.
";Tan Feng, you are unworthy of being a Grandmaster!"; Lu Yuan roared, but it was too late to stop him.
";Die?"; Jiang Ming laughed, raising his hand to block the attacks. ";It's not decided yet who will live and who will die!";
At the same time, he quickly threw Second Brother Hu far away.
";Impressive!"; Tan Feng frowned, slightly surprised. ";Such a young and powerful person, which sect are you from?";
";The Sword Qi is condensed and sharp, like it could cut gold and jade. Could it be the Pure Yang Sect's Pure Yang Sword Technique? No, wait, that technique has a magnificent aura but lacks the sharpness. Lu Yuan came over, looking at Jiang Ming with admiration. ";Could it be from the Zhen Wu Sect? But I've never heard of such a person!";
He paused and then laughed: ";It seems that my luck is really good. I had the fortune to encounter such a young powerful warrior in this moment of desperation. Brother, what is your name? Let's join forces and eliminate this Big Demon Head. Once we're outside the mountain, I'll treat you to a month's worth of drinks.";
";Brother Lu, my name is Jiang Ming!"; He bowed his hand in greeting.
";I have met Brother Jiang!"; Lu Yuan bowed back.
Jiang Ming nodded and then rushed towards Tan Feng, saying, ";What a wonderful night for insomnia, and a grandmaster to practice my skills.";
He was really ready to fight.
In half a year, his cultivation level had reached Martial Arts Second Realm Perfection, and he had even comprehended a large number of secret techniques and skills.
For example, the finger sword he had just used.
Jiang Ming had studied the cultivation skills of this world, combined them with his memories from his previous life, and deduced the Six Meridians Divine Sword with his formidable comprehension ability.
Although his cultivation level was not as high as that of a grandmaster, he was not the least bit afraid.
This was a perfect opportunity to test the enemy's strength and verify his own real combat power.
";Seeking death!"; Tan Feng sneered and launched his own attack.


CHAPTER-14
14 Chapter 14: Four Unique Skills, Slaying the Grandmaster

Jiang Ming and his opponent did not use any weapons.
After getting close, they exchanged blows 18 times in the blink of an eye.
The explosion of their True Qi pushed Lu Yuan back, terrifyingly powerful.
Jiang Ming stepped back a few paces, but his breath remained steady.
";What kind of fist technique are you using? It's so domineering, but I've never heard of it before."; Tan Feng showed a serious expression, ";Also, your True Qi is scattered, and you're clearly in the Innate Realm, not even reaching the level of a Grandmaster, yet you can fight against me.";
He was shocked.
No matter what, he was an established Grandmaster, far surpassing ordinary people in cultivation, combat experience, and training of cultivation skills.
However, he was stopped head-on by an expert in the Innate Realm.
Moreover, the opponent's True Qi gave him a sense of being overwhelming like a vast sea.
";Dragon-subduing Fist, of course you haven't heard of it!"; Jiang Ming said coldly.
Based on the Shock Fist and several other fist techniques he had learned, he deduced an extremely domineering fist technique using his powerful comprehension, which he named Dragon-subduing Fist.
It was on the same level as the Six Meridians Divine Sword, both being top-notch techniques.
Now, he was able to leave this world at any time, but he still needed to work hard to retain what he had gained.
His gaze focused, and a virtual screen appeared before him.
Name: Jiang Ming
Qi Cultivation: Second Realm (Peak of the Sea of Qi)
Body Cultivation: Second Transformation
Cultivation Skills: Guiyuan Sutra, Longxiang Dominator Body Skill; Six Meridians Divine Sword, Thunder Flash Mad Saber, Dragon-subduing Fist, Dragon-subduing Kick, Meteor Step, 36 Forms of Light Rain Sword, 18 Forms of Bursting Rain Sword
Talent: Hundredfold Comprehension, Soul Dominator (Temporary Solidification)
Mission: Become the Province Top Scorer in the Martial Arts Exam Preliminary Selection
Jiang Ming's information had changed  martial arts were divided into Qi cultivation and body cultivation. Qi cultivation was clearly the True Qi of martial arts, but what about body cultivation? It was obvious that it only appeared after practicing the Longxiang Dominator Body Skill.
The first four levels of Longxiang Dominator Body Skill had been successfully cultivated, and based on the strength standard, it corresponded to the Second Realm Sea of Qi cultivation level of martial arts.
Even though it was not as terrifying as the power with True Qi.
After all, the amount of his True Qi had already surpassed the understanding of ordinary people.
Besides the Six Meridians Divine Sword and Dragon-subduing Fist, he had also deduced other top-notch martial arts in this world, such as Dragon-subduing Kick, Meteor Step, and Thunder Flash Mad Saber; and slightly inferior techniques like the 36 Forms of Light Rain Sword and 18 Forms of Bursting Rain Sword.
In addition to these, he had deduced many other skills, such as the Seven Kills Sword Skill he had passed on to the members of the Black Wind Village. The combination of movement and stillness could enhance both their training and combat.
Although their improvement was fast, the drawback was obvious  their foundation would not be solid, almost cutting off their future path to the peak of martial arts.
Also, it could easily affect their state of mind.
This was the terror of Hundredfold Comprehension combined with Soul Dominator.
";Dragon-subduing Fist?"; Tan Feng was puzzled, but frowned, ";You want to subdue the dragon? Go to hell! Great Demon Stone Hand!";
He slapped his hand down, and his True Qi surged out, turning into a grinding disc that spun and pressed down, seeming capable of crushing everything into powder.
There was also a terrible pressure, making the air incredibly viscous.
Jiang Ming raised his eyebrows, leaped into the air, and kicked out a dragon shadow, pushing the opponent back. While still in mid-air, his body spun, controlling the fierce wind, and attacked with a series of leg shadows before landing.
The two fought again.
The True Qi from their collision scattered, tearing the rocks and shattering the stone pieces.
Jiang Ming proactively engaged the opponent in close combat, trying to understand the differences in True Qi.
The Third Realm of Martial Arts, or the Grandmaster level in this world, experienced a qualitative change in True Qi. He knew this, as it had been introduced and analyzed both in books and online.
However, without any real contact, it was difficult to understand the specific situation.
Now that the opportunity was right in front of him, he would not miss it.
";Yin and Yang Demon Hand!";
Tan Feng changed his move, one hand reaching for Jiang Ming's neck from above while the other transformed into a claw, targeting his lower body. At the same time, strands of True Qi sprayed out.
Jiang Ming felt a chill, retreated several meters, then lunged forward again with a step.
The rocks behind him had already exploded, leaving a deep pit.
Bang
Jiang Ming's full power was unleashed, not falling behind at all.
Even though the opponent had extensive combat experience, he couldn't do anything to Jiang Ming. At the same time, Jiang Ming seemed to have eyes on his back, blocking all of Tan Feng's killing moves.
";His True Qi quality is higher, more solid, and more powerful. One strand of his True Qi is equivalent to the power of two or three strands of mine!";
At the same time as fighting, Jiang Ming constantly analyzed and thought.
Whoosh
Seizing the opportunity, his Shaoze Sword's fingertip landed on the opponent's shoulder, only to see Tan Feng's True Qi flowing out, solidifying into substance. Although shattered, it did not hurt him.
";True Qi solidification, protective Gang Qi!";
Jiang Ming had an epiphany.
His eyes suddenly narrowed, as he saw Tan Feng pressing his finger, ejecting a substantive Sword Qi but not leaving his body, directly hitting his neck.
The sharp aura made his hair stand on end.
Jiang Ming dodged by turning his head, but the Sword Qi suddenly turned around and chased him.
";It can do that?";
Jiang Ming was shocked but also moved extremely fast.
With a twist of his finger, he blocked it with the Shaoze Sword. Although it didn't shatter, it still blocked it for a moment, and he quickly retreated to avoid the attack.
Cold sweat broke out on his forehead.
";He actually escaped!"; Tan Feng's face turned slightly pale, he took a breath, and his expression became even more serious.
At this time, Lu Yuan's voice came: ";Brother Jiang, that's the Sea Splitting Finger, one of the most difficult finger techniques to cultivate in the world, from the Sun and Moon Demon Sect. Once activated, the substantive finger sword can extend without leaving the body, possessing the ultimate sharpness of a sword, and can be used as a sword. It can kill with one blow unexpectedly. I didn't expect this old man to succeed in cultivating it. However, it consumes a lot of True Qi and also imposes a heavy mental burden.";
Jiang Ming grinned.
Sea Splitting Finger?
But he felt the sensation of a lightsaber.
";We can't go on like this, or everything will be in vain."; As he thought, Jiang Ming's Dantian's Sea of Qi began to boil, and waves of True Qi swarmed out, filling his body.
His momentum instantly climbed several levels.
With his profound True Qi and countless temperings of his body, as well as the ability to Merge into Heaven and Earth, receiving the cleansing by the natural Primal Qi, and practicing the Longxiang Dominator Body Skill, his physical strength was already capable of bearing a much larger output of True Qi.
At this moment, feeling the changes in Jiang Ming's aura, Tan Feng's eyebrows jumped wildly.
";Have you been hiding your strength all this time?"; Inexplicably, he was a little flustered. He took a deep breath to suppress the turmoil in his heart. ";No, you are only about 20 years old. Reaching the Innate Realm and being able to fight me has already exceeded common sense. How can you be even stronger? Which old guy are you impersonating?";
";You actually saw it. I won't hide it anymore. I am Jiang Shenwang, who has been in the world for eight thousand years!"; Jiang Ming acted old and vigorous, and after pretending to be majestic, he leaped up and swung his fists.
";Dragon Subduing!";
The fist wind roared, forming a huge dragon head that attacked, and the expelled air even caused an explosive sound.
";Three Yin Sword Art, One Sword Pierces the Crescent Moon!"; Tan Feng pulled out a soft sword from his waist, shook it slightly, and countless Sword Qi filled the sky. Surprisingly, they gathered in the air and landed on Jiang Ming's fist.
Breaking the surface with a single point.
However, the Fist Qi was broken, and the pounding True Qi still blasted him away.
";Dragon-subduing Kick!";
Jiang Ming completely exploded like an erupting volcano, the surging and erupting power transformed into the most terrifying attack, overwhelmingly suppressing Tan Feng.
The Gang Qi protecting his body also constantly exploded.
Finally, he was injured, and his bones cracked.
";Quan Wuer, why aren't you coming!"; Tan Feng had blood on the corner of his mouth, but he roared to the sky, holding a soft sword in his right hand, and wrapped his left fist with several turns of Gang Qi, resisting with difficulty.
";There are more of you?"; Jiang Ming glanced at the distance with the corner of his eye. He had sensed it just now but pretended not to know.
";Then you can die first!";
";True Dragon Dominates Nine Heavens, Fist Suppresses Eight Desolate Mountains.";
At this moment, Jiang Ming mobilized True Qi to the limit which his body could withstand. He threw a punch and produced a terrifying dragon over ten meters long.
Tan Feng's pupils shrank, showing a solemn expression.
";Boiling Blood True Method, explode!"; Unable to care about anything else, Tan Feng displayed the Forbidden Law. With boiling blood and violent True Qi, his sword slashed out several extremely condensed Sword Qi, only to be exploded by Jiang Ming's punch.
He was also knocked away, spewing blood uncontrollably.
";Die!"; Jiang Ming's figure moved slightly, using the Meteor Step to quickly chase after him, intending to kill with one blow.
";Stop!"; A roar also came from the distance, and one person leaped up, reaching more than 20 meters high, and kicked towards Jiang Ming while falling.
Like a falling meteor, it struck from mid-air, absolutely terrifying.
Jiang Ming's eyebrows jumped wildly.
He must dodge!
Whoosh
With a shift of his feet, he moved horizontally, but his hand flicked and shot out a dark shadow, which was a flying knife that directly penetrated Tan Feng's throat.
He was killed on the spot.
";You die too!";
Jiang Ming's hands trembled, and several more flying knives were shot out, heading towards the falling person.
Flying knives?
These were prepared beforehand.
They were also specially made for Second Brother Hu at a high price, extremely sharp, and very sturdy.


CHAPTER-15
15 Chapter Fifteen: Breaking the Void

Ding, ding, ding!
The flying knives were all repelled by his fists and sent flying.
However, the plummeting body was slightly slowed down.
";Without Qi, just the power of the physique!"; Jiang Ming's pupils shrank, his thoughts racing, flashing with countless ideas.
";You like jumping high, huh? Then I'll keep you up in the air!";
Jiang Ming thought as he threw a punch skyward.
";Soaring Hidden Dragon!";
Boom
The punch erupted, transforming into an invisible true dragon sweeping upwards, causing Quan Wuer's pupils to shrink. His body suddenly spun, and with a slight flex of his left leg, he ruthlessly stomped downwards.
An explosion echoed, shaking heaven and earth.
The moonlight distorted, reverberating through the mountains.
Jiang Ming's punch was forcibly crushed by the other party, but Quan Wuer was also rebounded upwards helplessly, reaching a height of more than thirty meters.
Suspended in mid-air, with no place to borrow strength, he could only fall again.
Watching this scene from a distance, Lu Yuan was stunned, then laughed, quickly saying: ";Brother Jiang, what a divine tactic, truly excellent. This wonderful method is perfect for dealing with Quan Wuer. Just keep him from touching the ground.";
";Quan Wuer practices the Longxiang Dominator Body Skill, his body is exceedingly powerful. It's rumored that he could smash powerful grandmasters. All weapons are useless against him, and he is impervious to both water and fire. His power is despairing to face.";
";Without Qi in his body, he can't borrow force and can't cross distances.";
";Brother Jiang, don't let him touch the ground!";
Lu Yuan's voice carried a trace of schadenfreude.
";You will die!"; In the air, Quan Wuer was furious.
But he was continuously attacked by Jiang Ming, unable to descend. Although he was unharmed, it was still uncomfortable.
";I'm the Vice Sect Leader of the Divine Fist Sect, if you are my enemy, then you are the enemy of the entire Divine Fist Sect, think carefully! There is no bad blood between us, this is all a misunderstanding. Let me go, and I'll act as if nothing has happened, okay?"; His voice softened as he revealed his identity and posed a threat.
Jiang Ming had an inexplicable expression on his face.
Let him go?
He wasn't a three-year-old child. As soon as the other party sprang into action, it was fated that one of them will die. After all, this was a martial world.
If I don't die, then I have to make you die.
Moreover, after hearing what Lu Yuan said, he realized that the other party was practicing the Longxiang Dominator Body Skill. He could feel it, and he couldn't possibly let the latter leave.
";Brother Jiang, don't listen to him!"; Lu Yuan had already caught his breath and jumped forward. With a palm in the air, he sent Quan Wuer even higher.
His Qi was concentrated to the extreme and had already surpassed the Innate realm.
He had reached the Master-level Realm, Jiang Ming made his judgement.
";I accidentally discovered his and Tan Feng's secret and was attacked by them. I ran away because I couldn't match them. Otherwise, how could just one of them make me, the young master, so embarrassed?"; Lu Yuan quickly explained the cause and effect. ";Now that we know his situation, how could he let us go? Collaborating with the Demon Sect is tantamount to being enemies with all the righteous Tianxia Sects, not to mention that he wants to assassinate the Sect Leader of the Divine Fist Sect.";
He unleashed another two palms towards the air.
At this moment, Quan Wuer's body suddenly spun around, and using the force of the blowback, he darted in the other direction.
";I have been prepared for you!"; Jiang Ming, as swift as lightning, had already arrived ahead and continued his onslaught, forcing Quan Wuer back to the upper air.
";Damn it!"; Quan Wuer was furious but powerless.
This clearly exposed the drawback of body cultivation.
Although powerful, he didn't understand the way of transformation. If he had a strong Qi, he would have already fallen to the ground. How could he be in such a disarray?
";Scheme against the Sect Leader?"; Jiang Ming blinked, ";Go on!";
";I've only heard bits and pieces."; Lu Yuan didn't conceal anything, ";The Divine Fist Sect possesses unparalleled body refinement methods in the world, they have the Divine Fist Scripture and the Long Xiang Dominator Body Skill both of which surpass Dalin Temple's Vajra Skill. However, they have a shortcoming  they lack a true ultimate martial arts skill. Their Qi cultivation and adaptability in battle are barely satisfactory, so they have always been suppressed by the Zhen Wu Sect, Chunyang Sect, and Dalin Temple.";
";The Divine Fist Sect has also been strategizing to perfect an ultimate martial arts technique, but to no avail.";
";It seems like Quan Wuer and Tan Feng's conversation entailed the Sun and Moon Demon Sect presenting the lost Shaoyang Scripture in order to ensnare the Sect Leader. Then, they would join hands to kill him, so Quan Wuer could take his place.";
";A while ago, I heard a rumor that the Shaoyang Scripture had appeared in Mount Dependence City, I thought it was fake.";
";Then I heard that the Leader of the Divine Fist Sect travelled to Mount Dependence City, giving rise to some doubts.";
";Only after uncovering Quan Wuer's conspiracy, did I understand.";
";Quan Wuer used the Demon Sect to plot against the Sect Leader in order to become the leader himself. And the Demon Sect? They'll probably want to reignite conflict within the world.";
";Is what I'm saying correct?";
Lu Yuan looked up to the sky as he spoke.
Quan Wuer didn't respond.
But Jiang Ming said: ";Shaoyang Scripture?";
";You never heard of it?"; Lu Yuan felt surprised, seeing Jiang Ming nod, he explained: ";Legend has it that long ago two exceptional talents appeared in this world. They honed each other, vied against each other and gradually, one of them comprehended the Nine Yin Divine Art, while the other created the Nine Yang Divine Scripture. You know about the Chunyang Sect, right? It is said they got a piece of the Nine Yang Divine Scripture which was later improved by the ancestor of Chunyang, and that's how the Chunyang Manual was created, and subsequently the Chunyang Sect. Lengyue Palace seemingly acquired a part of the Nine Yin Divine Art and garnered a great legacy; Dalin Temple, Zhen Wu Sect and Sun and Moon Demon Sect also have a share of these two unparalleled martial arts' heritage. The Shaoyang Scripture is also a part of the Nine Yang True Scripture, once it appears, do you think the world would remain calm?";
";Do you believe it?"; Jiang Ming smiled and asked, ";In the same era, two world-dazzling figures comprehend unparalleled martial arts. After their teachings were passed down, people who obtained a piece of it created their own powerful sect. What about their original sect? Their family? The forces behind them?";
His heart, however, sank.
If what Lu Yuan has said is true, striving for the Nine Yin and Nine Yang would be incredibly difficult.
";I don't believe it either, it's too fantastical, but there are always rumors!"; Lu Yuan shrugged.
";Could it have come from outside the world?"; Jiang Ming pointed to the sky, ";In ancient books, I have read about the theory of shattering the void. If martial artists could break the void, could it be that there are outsiders?";
";Breaking the void, outsiders?"; Lu Yuan was astonished, ";I've never heard of it, but your theory is mystical. Can martial artists break the void?";
He scratched his head.
Jiang Ming had an inexplicable look in his eyes.
At this moment, a change occurred in the sky above.
";Heart beats like a drum, blood boils, body dyed in blue blood battling the heaven.";
";Fighting spirit is high, death wish formed, unrest until enemies are killed.";
Thump, thump, thump.
The beating of Quan Wuer's heart sounded like the beating of war drums, allowing the two people below to hear. Then, layers of blood mist emerged from his body, intertwining with each other.
His body flipped, head down, feet up.
A formidable punch was launched downwards and on his fist, a fist-sized blood mist condensed, resembling a tangible blood-colored Gang air.
";This is the Blood War Secret Skill of the Divine Fist Sect, it can boost several layers of combat power, be careful!"; Lu Yuan warned, his expression serious.
";Blood War Secret Skill? Making blood vitalize, emerge from the body, forming a special force, interesting!"; Jiang Ming's eyes narrowed, revealing more interest.
";Then let me test the power of his punch!";
";Dragon Soaring from the Abyss, Fighting for Nine Heavens!";
Jiang Ming made his move, his body soared into the air, the Qi inside his body boiling and raging out from his Sea of Qi, forming the terrifying killing move of the Dragon-subduing Fist.


CHAPTER-16
16 Chapter 16: Blast

The moon was high in the sky, and the mountain breeze was strong.
The sky cracked open, and Quan Wuer was blasted into the sky again, not falling down.
Jiang Ming fell, smashing into a deep pit.
The surrounding rocks cracked completely.
";So powerful!"; He shook his arm, looking up into the sky, his eyes deep.
Lu Yuan, who was beside him, gasped in shock. He knew the terror of Quan Wuer. Under normal circumstances, he could barely cope with it, but the secret skill he had just activated would be impossible for him to resist.
But now, this little brother seemed to be completely fine.
";Where did this monster come from!"; Lu Yuan suppressed the waves in his heart and laughed, ";Haha, Wuer, you still want to come down? Dream on!";
";Brother Jiang!"; Quan Wuer's blood and energy surged, his face pale.
After being hit consecutively and using the secret skill just now, his consumption was massive. In addition to the urgency in his heart, he almost choked for a moment.
He ignored Lu Yuan and said to Jiang Ming, ";What can we do to stop this?";
";There is no feud between us. I also don't want to get involved in the conflict between good and evil. I just want to cultivate quietly, enjoy the beautiful mountains and rivers, and taste fine wine and beautiful women. But you insist on attacking me."; Jiang Ming's eyes flickered, and after another punch, his voice reached the sky, ";To make peace is simple. I want to know the cultivation content of the Longxiang Dominator Body Skill.";
";Brother Jiang!"; Lu Yuan was anxious but was stopped by Jiang Ming's wave.
Lu Yuan opened his mouth, unable to laugh bitterly.
";The Longxiang Dominator Body Skill is one of the supreme skills of my Divine Fist Sect.";
";You've colluded with the Demon Sect, and you still care about the sect? Don't forget, you are now at our mercy. There are too many ways to kill you.";
";I"; Quan Wuer wanted to curse, but forcibly calmed down.
From the fight, he understood that the opponent was not weaker than himself, and may even be stronger. Coupled with Lu Yuan, even if they fought after landing, there was a high chance that he would be killed.
";I need a guarantee, make an oath!"; Quan Wuer demanded.
";I have a flying knife."; Jiang Ming simply ignored him, as he slapped his left hand, and a flying knife appeared in his right hand, ";It can go from the bottom upwards, into the anus, through the abdomen, and out through the mouth.";
";Brother Jiang, you're disgusting!"; As soon as Lu Yuan heard it, his legs tightened and his face changed slightly. ";There are few weaknesses for body cultivators, and the anus is one of them. Now he is on top, and we are below. It's easy to deal with him. Brother Jiang, this method is excellent. In the future, when fighting against powerful body cultivators, use this method to force them into the sky, and then strike at the soul!";
";So cruel!"; Quan Wuer felt chills in his heart. ";You better listen, I'll only say it once. Whether you remember it or not depends on your ability!";
After weighing his options, he quickly recited the content of the Longxiang Dominator Body Skill.
This skill had only six layers.
First Layer is Third-tier, Second Layer is Second-tier, Third Layer is First-tier, Fourth Layer corresponds to Innate, Fifth Layer corresponds to Grandmaster, and Sixth Layer corresponds to Great Grandmaster.
Jiang Ming listened carefully, and he caught a strange meaning.
This Quan Wuer was speaking nine truths and one lie, replacing the key content.
But he didn't care too much.
As long as he had time, even without the contents of the last two layers, he was confident of deducing them. Now, with the introduction, he could deduce the real face of the last two layers with some deliberation.
";The Sixth Layer is not perfect and has a significant flaw!"; Jiang Ming's thoughts raced, slightly analyzing and admiring the high-level predecessors who created this method. He also noticed the lack of strength in the final stage, but he did not know whether it was due to his personal limitations or some other reason.
";Only six layers?"; He asked again.
Lu Yuan, who was beside him, spoke up: ";I know this. The Longxiang Dominator Body Skill has only six layers. No one knows if it is because the sixth layer is too profound and mysterious, but it seems like nobody from the Divine Fist Sect has ever successfully cultivated it.";
";The sixth layer is too profound, hard to comprehend!"; Quan Wuer said, ";Even if you can only successfully cultivate the first five layers, you can still dominate the master-level realm and resist the great grandmaster.";
";If you're really that strong, what's going on with you?"; Lu Yuan mocked.
";If I had truly cultivated the Fifth Layer to its peak, how could you have trapped me!"; Quan Wuer's face was ugly.
No one would feel good in this situation.
Falling down and being blasted, constantly going up and down like a spring.
Even Second Brother Hu, who was hiding far away, couldn't help but grin, but as for the strength of his own Great Village Master, he had a terrifying feeling.
He was too strong.
Unreasonably strong.
How could such a strong person be a bandit in a small village?
Unable to make sense of it, he didn't want to think about it either.
";Quan Wuer, tell me about the cultivation method of the Divine Fist Sutra!"; Jiang Ming looked up and said, flipping the flying knife in his hand.
";Impossible, absolutely impossible!"; Quan Wuer burst out in anger. ";Even if I were killed, it still wouldn't be possible!";
";Then you'll just fall!"; Jiang Ming sensed the opponent's determination and leapt to the side.
";Brother Jiang!"; Lu Yuan was very anxious, but seeing Jiang Ming's solemn expression and readiness to strike, he didn't try to stop him.
At this moment, Quan Wuer had already landed.
Whoosh
Jiang Ming made a sudden move, charging towards Quan Wuer, while simultaneously raising his hand to send a flying knife tearing through the air, reaching the opponent in the blink of an eye.
";I'm prepared for you!"; Quan Wuer revealed a smile, making him look even more ferocious. He raised his arm and attempted to catch the flying knife between his index and middle fingers.
To him, this was a minor trick.
The flying knife was fast, but his hands were even faster.
However, at this moment, his pupils suddenly contracted because he couldn't catch the knife.
";How is this possible?"; Quan Wuer saw a shocking scene, as the flying knife suddenly accelerated towards him.
The next moment, the knife struck his left eye, embedding itself within, causing Quan Wuer to scream in pain. The Qi carried by the flying knife made him feel as if his brain was being ripped apart.
Intolerable pain, dizziness in his sight.
If it weren't for his incredibly burly body and strong Blood Qi, he would have died on the spot.
";Die!";
Jiang Ming's attack had arrived.
With surging Qi on his fist, he landed the Dragon-Subduing Fist on Quan Wuer's chest. In an instant, he dealt eighteen blows.
Clothes exploded, bones crackled.
The seemingly invulnerable body that was impervious to both water and fire was nearly blown apart by Jiang Ming.
His chest collapsed, and fine pieces of internal organs were vomited out of his mouth.
The intensely throbbing heart had stopped completely, as it was directly smashed apart.
Quan Wuer flew back, crashing into the rocks behind him and creating a crater. He struggled to lift his head, glaring at Jiang Ming with ineffable hatred. ";You you";
He slumped down before finishing his sentence, his breath gone.
";He really was hard to kill!"; Jiang Ming let out a deep breath.
His body was too strong.
Jiang Ming also realized his shortcomings, that he didn't have a real finishing move. It's somewhat difficult to defeat opponents of higher levels.
If it weren't for his spiritual power to guide the flying knife into accelerating, catching Quan Wuer off guard and severely injuring him, it would have been challenging to kill him.
";You killed him just like that?"; Lu Yuan found it hard to believe.
First, he killed Tan Feng, then Quan Wuer.
This younger brother of his had incredibly calm and steady demeanor.
It made even the well-experienced Lu Yuan feel a little dazed.
";Otherwise!"; Jiang Ming laughed. ";He's just a brute!";
";A brute?"; Lu Yuan grinned.
If Quan Wuer were in the army, he could slay an army of ten thousand.
Second Brother Hu hurried over with a delighted expression. ";Great Village Master! You're so mighty! Did you get injured?";
";Great Village Master?"; Lu Yuan was dumbfounded. ";Don't tell me you're the master of this village!";
He pointed at the ground beneath his feet.
Jiang Ming nodded.
";How is this possible?"; Lu Yuan jumped. ";Although heroes come from different backgrounds, this is just too unbelievable!";
";Whether it's unbelievable or not, Lu Yuan, as a guest on my territory, I must show you the hospitality of a host. Brother Lu, please!"; Jiang Ming gestured forward and said to Second Brother Hu, ";Take care of their bodies and make sure no one discovers them.";
With that, he walked ahead.
Lu Yuan hurriedly followed. ";Brother Jiang, wait, what's going on? I don't believe you're just the leader of a bandit village.";
";We'll talk about it later!"; Jiang Ming laughed. ";Brother Lu, you can first tell me who is the strongest in this world, and how many Great Grandmasters there are!";


CHAPTER-17
17 Chapter 17: Rapid Increase in Cultivation Level

";There are many great Grandmasters in the world, but there is indeed one who is widely recognized as the strongest!";
That is Master Zhang Quanyi of the Zhen Wu Sect, who is ninety-nine years old and has been unbeaten throughout the world in his time.
Lu Yuan's spirits were lifted.
";Back then, when the disciples of the Sun and Moon Demon Sect killed one of his disciples, Elder Zhang single-handedly went up to the Sect's Main Headquarters. He went on a killing spree, turning the Blue Mountains red with blood, leaving the Demon Sect members trembling in fear, beheading Sect Leaders, and killing Elders, almost exterminating them. Thus, the Demonic Sect was gravely weakened and has laid dormant ever since.";
Apart from him, there are also the Chunyang Master of the Chunyang Sect, the Lengyue Fairy of the Lengyue Palace, Sword God He Yiming of the Divine Sword Villa, the contemporary Sect Leader Yang Kaitai of the Sun and Moon Demon Sect, and Wang Wudi, the overseer of the Six Gates who sits in the court. They are all acknowledged as powerful Grandmasters.
";I believe that the Dalin Temple should also have a Grandmaster, and I even suspect that there is more than one. As for the others, it's hard to say.";
In the small courtyard, Lu Yuan sipped his wine, and then counted on his fingers, finally unable to resist asking, ";Shouldn't you already know this stuff?";
";I have always been in seclusion, so I know very little about the outside world. Brother Lu, we hit it off right away, so let's drink three hundred cups together, please!";
";Haha, please!";
The two men drank and chatted with each other.
Jiang Ming saw Second Brother Hu coming over and said to Lu Yuan, ";Brother Lu, as a righteous Grandmaster, you must have quite a few friends, right?";
";Of course! I am known as the dashing and charming man with a reputation that spans across the world of martial arts, and am considered the most passionate and chivalrous person. The Chunyang Sect, the Zhen Wu Sect, the Dalin Temple, and the Six Gates, each with my friends.";
";Brother Lu is well-connected, I admire that!"; Jiang Ming gave a thumbs up and said, ";I am going to go down the mountain to make friends through martial arts and battle the world. But I cannot set my mind at ease about the village. In the past, this place used to be a bandit's den, but after I subdued it, its nature has changed, and now the people on the mountain only want to lead a good life. But I'm afraid that once I leave, it will bring trouble. Brother Lu, could you help me out a bit, to relieve my worries? I'll owe you a favor.";
Upon hearing this, Second Brother Hu couldn't help but be moved and even more grateful.
They were trying to secure the village's future.
He looked at Lu Yuan with hopeful eyes.
";Brother Jiang is truly passionate!"; Lu Yuan thought about it for a while, ";However, given your strength, if you publicize tonight's battle, who would dare to be presumptuous? But your concerns are also reasonable, we should be afraid of villains, not gentlemen. Let me think, as for the village Generally, it would fall under local jurisdiction but the Six Gates would also oversee it. How about this, I have some connections with Wang Wudi of the Six Gates, I can send him a letter asking him to take care of this place.";
";Thank you, Brother Lu, now I can set my worries aside!"; Jiang Ming bowed with his hands clasped.
";Brother Jiang, I am very curious, with your strength, you shouldn't be hiding here, and I haven't heard of your name either. Could it be that you are from a hidden family?"; Lu Yuan asked again.
";I come from the sky!"; Jiang Ming pointed to the sky.
Lu Yuan was speechless, showing a resentful expression.
Two days later.
On the official road to Mount Dependence City, there was a large carriage, driven by an old coachman. Despite the two horses in front, he controlled them with remarkable skill.
By his side, there was another horse, on which Lu Yuan lay. He mumbled, ";Brother Jiang, this is too slow.";
";The slower it goes, the more we can appreciate the beauty of the mountains and rivers!"; Jiang Ming's voice came from inside the carriage, and he rolled up the curtain as well.
Also in the carriage was Lan, who took care of their daily needs.
In his words, life is meant to be enjoyed, so why bother riding fast and sleeping in the wilderness.
";Oh, give it a rest!"; Lu Yuan sat upright, ";I'll go ahead first and wait for you at a resting place.";
";That's fine."; Jiang Ming nodded, ";Brother Lu, can you lend me some more Qi?";
";Don't even dream about it. The Master-level Realm is achieved by personal comprehension, not by understanding the different quality of someone else's Qi. If it were that easy, powerful Grandmasters would be everywhere!";
Nonetheless, Lu Yuan shot out a strand of Qi before galloping off.
Jiang Ming captured the Qi in his hand, carefully sensing its differences from his own.
";It doesn't work for others because they are not me!";
He closed his eyes, feeling it carefully.
Lan sat quietly beside him. Seeing that there was nothing for her to do, she prepared to start her own cultivation when she felt Jiang Ming's aura suddenly change.
Faintly but undoubtedly, it gave her a sense of shock and awe.
";Has Young Master made another breakthrough?"; Lan's pretty eyes were filled with astonishment.
At this moment, Jiang Ming had an epiphany.
";The Third Layer of Martial Arts, Qi Transformation.";
There are actually two paths to take: one is to truly perceive the change in the quality of Qi; the second is to compress the Qi in the Dantian within the Sea of Qi and break it down by force, which is extremely dangerous. If one is not careful and the Dantian explodes, it will be completely over.
However, he was now perceiving another person's Qi, thus through analogy and inference, he had a direct enlightenment.
Inside his Sea of Qi, his Dantian.
At this moment, Jiang Ming's Qi suddenly collapses and transforms, causing a chain reaction within the vast sea of Qi and stirring up an invisible storm.
Transformation was intense and swift.
At the same time, it refined his body, purifying his internal organs and bones.
Jiang Ming's breath continued to rise unabated.
The carriage moved forward slowly without stopping, and no one disturbed them.
As noon approached, a tea house appeared in front of them, and only then did Jiang Ming open his eyes and reveal a smile.
";Success!";
";In the Main World, I am at the Third Layer of Gang Qi in Martial Arts.";
";In this world, I have achieved the master-level realm!";
Even he himself didn't expect to progress so quickly.
In his Dantian Sea of Qi, the True Qi had decreased to one-third of its original level, but its power had greatly increased, and its connection with Heaven and Earth had become even closer.
He raised his hand, and a point of light condensed on his fingertip.
That was Sword Qi.
Substantial Sword Qi.
";One manifestation of Gang Qi is to condense Qi into weapons or to materialize True Qi!";
As Jiang Ming thought, waves of True Qi surged out and wrapped around his arm, eventually covering his entire right arm, like armor.
Whether condensing Qi into weapons or wrapping Gang Qi, they required a long time of polishing to succeed, but his True Qi was too thick and his comprehension too defying of the heavens.
As a result, he mastered it directly after Breaking Through.
";If I were to fight against Tan Feng now, I could kill him with a single punch!";
";Even against Quan Wuer, if I were to use my full strength, one punch might not kill him, but two definitely would take his life.";
";Awesome!";
Jiang Ming gave himself a thumbs up.
";Congratulations to the Young Master!"; Lan happily said, ";Young Master is mighty!";
Jiang Ming couldn't help but laugh.
Suddenly, he frowned; this time during his breakthrough, the system didn't grant him any talents.
";Is it because of uncertainty?";
Jiang Ming couldn't help but ponder, after all, everything he gained here might not truly belong to himself. If he didn't achieve the corresponding accomplishments, once he left here and returned to teh Main World, his cultivation level and the corresponding memories obtained here would be erased.
The carriage slowed to a stop.
";Young Master, there's a tea shop ahead, and Hero Lu is waiting for you. Should we stop?";
";Old Ma, let's stop and take a break!";
The coachman's surname was Ma; he was an old man from Black Wind Village who was good at driving the carriage and had a solid cultivation level. He came out with them this time.
Lu Yuan, who was drinking tea, saw Jiang Ming and couldn't help but narrow his eyes. He suddenly stood up in disbelief, ";Brother Jiang, did youdid you Break Through?";
";It was by chance, just by chance!"; Jiang Ming smilingly walked over.
";Impossible, absolutely impossible!"; Lu Yuan was somewhat disoriented.
Even without knowing his age, one could guess from his face that he was around twenty years old, and he had already defied the heavens by killing two Grandmasters.
Through analyzing the True Qi of Grandmasters, he made a breakthrough in just two days?
This was simply ridiculous.
However, the unique aura emanating from him due to his recent breakthrough told the whole story.
A twenty-year-old Grandmaster?
Before the breakthrough, he could kill veteran Grandmasters, so what about now?
Comparable to a Great Grandmaster?
Lu Yuan was disoriented.
He became even more self-absorbed.
After eating something simple, they continued on their way.
Lu Yuan sat on the horse, beginning to cultivate.
As Jiang Ming polished his True Qi, he also studied the subsequent changes of the Longxiang Dominator Body Skill, pondering the changes and perfecting it to prepare for cultivation.
Two months passed in a blink of an eye and they were not far from Mount Dependence City.
He received a message from Chang Qing.


CHAPTER-18
18 Chapter 18: Testing the Sword in the World

Guhuai Town.
It was an ancient town, named after a thousand year old ancient pagoda tree. Because of its propitious location by the mountains and water, it exuded prosperity.
It wasn't far ahead.
";This is the slowest and longest journey I've ever taken,"; Lu Yuan lounged on his horse, murmuring incessantly, ";Luckily, we're almost at Guhuai town. They have great wine, delicious food, even a brothel; it's truly the liveliest spot. Brother Jiang, fancy experiencing something fresh?";
";I definitely do not wish to be a fellow practitioner!"; Jiang Ming replied.
";Fellow practitioners?"; Lu Yuan responded, taken aback. Understanding at last, he turned his head towards Jiang Ming seated in the carriage, displaying a peculiar expression, ";Is this something you would be aware of?";
Lan, however, was puzzled.
Old Ma up front smiled at this exchange.
";All men!"; Jiang Ming opened his eyes, ";This trip might be slow, but your powers have increased considerably.";
";Indeed they have, but…"; Lu Yuan grimaced, ";I can't believe I didn't gain any advantage from you. You even suppressed me effortlessly. You truly are…"; Seeing Jiang Ming's hostile expression, he quickly changed his words, ";Fortunately, I've learnt a lot of brilliant moves from you, otherwise, I would be at a real loss.";
The two of them had had numerous competitive bouts on the road, he didn't mind losing, but what astonished him was that he observed an incessant growth in Jiang Ming's abilities.
Lu Yuan was filled with a chilling sensation.
He had met talents before, but none as monstrous as this.
In his opinion, even Elder Zhang from the Zhen Wu Sect wasn't as frightening as this.
Just then, a figure leapt down from a tree in front of them, addressing Old Ma, ";Uncle Ma, is the Young Master in the carriage…";
";Yes, it's the Young Master inside!"; Old Ma hastily reminded the man. Seeing his ragged clothes, fatigue-filled face, and bloodshot eyes, Old Ma anxiously asked, ";Has there been some trouble?";
Jiang Ming jumped down beside the young man, ";Liu, is there trouble?";
When he had asked General Chang and others to go their separate ways, he had planned everything.
Even his approximate whereabouts were informed to the other party, in order to stay connected at all times.
He had received numerous reports during their journey.
";You, Young, Young Master!"; Liu knelt down on one knee, visibly stirred, ";General Chang told me you'd be passing this way, I've been waiting here for three days!";
Jiang Ming helped Liu to his feet.
Lan too disembarked the carriage.
Lu Yuan dismounted from his horse, choosing to stand to the side.
";Can you tell us what exactly happened?"; Jiang Ming investigated further.
Liu rapidly filled them in.
General Chang and his men were initially sent to travel along the mountain range for experiential learning, destroying mountain bandit camps they encountered, seizing goods and wealth in the process, all while continuing to accrue cultivation skills.
After Jiang Ming came down the mountain, his journey was slightly adjusted based on the direction he was heading.
He received a few messages on the way. General Chang had already eliminated quite a few bandit groups, each time they destructed a group, they would seize supplies and recruit some people to replenish their own team.
As a result, their group troops had swelled in size.
However, when they arrived in the neighborhood a few days ago, they discovered three separate bandit groups; Erlong Mountain, Baiyun Village, and Longhu Village.
They were suddenly ambushed by Erlong Mountain, but managed to decimate almost all enemy troops. However, they were pushed back when Baiyun Village and Longhu Village intervened to support the enemy.
Just as they were planning to choose an opponent to eliminate first, they were encircled and attacked by all three bandit groups together. As if matters couldn't get worse, an Innate expert showed up and seriously injured General Chang.
";We're fortunate to have undergone rigorous training in the past, and have superb cooperation. Otherwise, General Chang would have been killed, and our team would have been dispersed. During the withdrawal, General Chang quietly ordered the three of us to meet you here."; Liu's face turned grim, ";Brother Xiong and Brother Yang didn't make it here.";
Not being here meant they were dead.
Shuddering a little, Liu quickly added, ";The situation is probably not looking good for General Chang and the others. Young Master…";
";Don't worry, leave it to me!"; Jiang Ming patted Liu's shoulder, saying, ";Old Ma, Lan, you'll take Liu to the town ahead and rest there for a while. Wait for my return.";
";Brother Lu, will you accompany me into the mountains, or will you go to the town?"; Jiang Ming looked at Lu Yuan, taking out his weapons from the carriage.
A sword and a knife, strapped across his back with Lan's assistance.
There was also a flying knife in his waist, covered by his outer robe.
";Of course, I'm joining!"; Lu Yuan appeared eager, ";It's been peaceful for too long, how could I miss finally getting to some excitement? Brother Jiang, I'm known for my unparalleled Light Skills in the world of martial arts, would you like a race? Since I'm familiar with the region and the situation in the three villages, I can guide you!";
";Okay!"; Jiang Ming nodded.
";Please be careful, Young Master!"; Lan showed her concern.
";You two hold fort in town, if there's any trouble, just mention Lu Brother's name!"; Having said this, Jiang Ming soared into the air. Like a lightning bolt, he was soon twenty metres away.
";What speed!"; Lu Yuan's face filled with exhilaration, while also shooting off like an arrow. The two were soon out of sight.
";Don't worry, with the Young Master's capabilities, he can go anywhere in the world."; Seeing the worried expressions of the duo, Old Ma smiled, ";Let's go, we'll wait in the town for the Young Master, but remember to keep a low profile.";
The three of them urged the horses to proceed.
Lu Yuan was met with a sad realization: despite his expertise in Light Skill, he was increasingly lagging behind Jiang Ming. He called out in desperation, ";Wait!";
Jiang Ming slowed down, waiting for Lu Yuan to catch up, unable to contain his laughter, ";You're really too slow, I'm just beginning to warm up.";
";Freak!"; Lu Yuan huffed, ";This town here is Guhuai. Not too far ahead is the Mountain City. If we're going by the book, this place shouldn't be laden with bandits. But there are three bandit groups here. Do you know why?";
";They're being bred?";
";Exactly, they're being bred!";
Mountain City is special, serving as a gateway to the continuous mountain range. There's also a major river that flows by it, thus rendering it an advantageous geographical location.
All sorts of exotic treasures from the mountains and goods from different regions, many of them transit here.
The city is dominated by three factions, the largest of which is the Xiao family, whose fame is resounding and they're no less powerful than any general sect. The second is the Liang family, their heritage spanning over two hundred years also makes them incredibly powerful. The third faction comprises of representatives from the government, mainly from the Six Gates Sect, who kept an eye on the happenings within the city.
";I suspect Erlong Mountain, Baiyun Village, and Longhu Village were all bred by these three factions."; Lu Yuan appeared thoughtful, ";The Six Gate's men generally don't involve themselves in the conflicts, they simply observe the situation between the others. The Xiao and Liang families have been engaging in covert fights, yet they maintain harmony on the surface. However, I suspect that their relations are extremely complex. Additionally, there are several other forces inside the city that barely constitute a fourth faction, along with some sects having their branches setup here.";
";Why is the Six Gates Sect stationing people here?"; Jiang Ming wondered, ";Don't they only intervene during major cases?";
";Due to the large profits involved here, the Six Gates Sect wanted a share of it. They placed one of their constables here, securing the situation and maintaining order amongst the factions, to prevent chaos.";
";Six Gates Sect isn't really dominant. Otherwise, how could these two families grow so powerful, and even breed three bandit groups.";
";Ah, indeed. But Brother Jiang, you better consider this: If you confront these mountain bandits, you're likely to face difficulty from the entire Mountain City. In addition to this, the Shaoyang Scripture has also appeared here, the Divine Fist Sect and Sun and Moon Demon Sect will dispatch powerful men here, along with other figures from the world of martial arts. Just thinking about it makes me excited but also sends shivers down my spine.";
";The more powerful they are, the better. It's a good time for me to measure up against the world.";
Upon hearing this, Lu Yuan shuddered even more.


CHAPTER-19
19 Chapter 19: Enemies of the Righteous Path

On the mountain peak.
Chang Qing stood with his blade, covered in bloodstains, behind him were his brothers, all very exhausted, and many of them were injured.
";Commander, there's no more water, if we continue like this, we'll all be trapped to death."; A young man whispered, ";We're just intimidated by an Innate, why not rush down, and if he appears, fight to the death to kill him, and then make a bloody escape.";
";That's the last resort!"; Chang Qing turned around and looked in the distance, which was the direction of Guhuai Town: according to time calculations, the Great Village Master should have arrived.
Even if he's here, can he save us?
He was a little shaken.
At this time, a figure appeared on the opposite hill, shouting at them, ";Chang Qing, you're already at the end of the road, if you continue to struggle, there will be only one way of death waiting for you.";
";Chang Qing, I admire you, you're young, and have already stepped into the First-tier realm. With your ability to command, you have formidable strength, and with just a few hundred men, you almost toppled three villages.";
";Impressive!";
";Now I'll give you a way to survive  submit.";
";As long as you submit, you'll have beautiful women, wine, and money aplenty.";
";Martial Art Cultivation Skills, resources, and broader opportunities in Heaven and Earth can all be yours, your men too.";
";All you have to do is show loyalty. Don't think about escape, as long as we have you surrounded, we have completely cut off your retreat.";
";Here, I, Xiao Ming, am the king. Although I'm only Innate, I have many more Innate, even Grandmaster powerhouses behind me.";
";What do you say?";
Xiao Ming held his long sword behind his back, his voice booming.
Chang Qing's face was calm, but many of his men behind him were shaken, and there was a hushed exchange. Without looking back, he knew that most of those who were shaken were those who had been subdued later.
They were also the ones who died the most.
Some of the silent men looked at them with cold eyes.
";What do you say?"; A voice suddenly rang out.
Although it was behind Xiao Ming, it also reached the other hill.
";Great Village Master!"; Chang Qing was slightly startled, his face showing joy, and he knelt down on one knee, ";Greetings, Great Village Master!";
";Greetings, Great Village Master!";
All of Black Wind Village's people knelt down.
After hesitating for a moment, those who were subdued also knelt down hesitantly.
Xiao Ming was shocked, and with his strength, how could he not have noticed someone approaching from behind? What did this mean?
The other party was undoubtedly terrifying.
Clang!
The long sword appeared, and between the sword light and the rotation of the sword, it covered the area behind him, but in the next moment, his face stiffened because the tip of the sword was caught.
Caught between the index and middle fingers.
His courage suddenly chilled, and he urged his Qi, making the long sword hum, but it couldn't budge.
";Struggle again, and I'll kill you!"; Jiang Ming said coldly.
After arriving here, he found a mountain peak surrounded by countless mountain bandits, and another peak echoed Xiao Ming's voice, so he quickly came this side.
Crack
With a little force in his fingers, the tip of the sword was shattered, and with a slight movement, it shot out, piercing Xiao Ming's wrist holding the sword.
In the pain, the broken sword fell with a loosened grip.
Xiao Ming was even more shocked: ";Who are you?";
";Didn't you hear, I'm the Great Village Master!"; Jiang Ming looked at him indifferently, ";Xiao Ming? A member of Xiao Family in Mount Dependence City? You really raised mountain thieves.";
";Let me guess, Xiao and Liang families appear to be harmonious on the surface, but they secretly compete. This is a high-level cover. Maintaining peace on the surface, but secretly making Six Gates and other forces understand that Mount Dependence City is not united. But one layer deeper is the friendship between Xiao and Liang families.";
";Just like the Three Mountain Villages, they seem to be harmonious on the surface, but they secretly compete and unite when in danger, acting in unison against outsiders.";
";Seeing the mountain as a mountain, not as a mountain, and finally as a mountain.";
";Xiao and Liang both have experts!";
Jiang Ming said, carefully observing the subtle changes in the other's expression, his confidence grew.
Originally, there were two major forces in a city, but the Six Gates joined in.
And other forces coveted it.
What to do?
Unite together? It would only be targeted. It's better to be openly friendly while secretly competing, forming a true alliance at the root and maintaining the positions of the two families in Mount Dependence City.
If there's a threat, directly eliminate the others using the two families' secret competition as an excuse.
";Wow, this speculation is amazing!"; Lu Yuan also arrived, his pupils shrank upon hearing Jiang Ming's analysis, ";Under the stability, there are raging undercurrents, but they can firmly control Mount Dependence City at the root. This may also be the reason why they have always been in power, and the only reason other forces cannot truly gain a foothold in this city. Impressive, impressive.";
";Great Village Master? Who are you exactly?"; Xiao Ming's heart raced, and his eyes narrowed into a slit, as murderous intent surged.
But when he saw Lu Yuan, his pupils shrank again, ";Brother Lu, how come you're here?";
";Haha, I'm just here for fun!"; Lu Yuan laughed and jumped squatting on a rock beside him.
";Brother Lu, you've always had a good relationship with our Xiao Family."; Xiao Ming tried to relax, ";This must be your friend, and a friend of our Xiao Family. There must be a misunderstanding.";
";There's no misunderstanding!"; Jiang Ming got the information he wanted, and with a thought, he asked, ";Do you know Shaoyang Scripture?";
";Forget it, asking you is useless!";
Jiang Ming shook his head again, pointing with a finger, sending out a powerful Sword Qi, called Shaoze Sword. This made Xiao Ming, who had been secretly vigilant, panic and abruptly twist his body, but he was a step too slow.
Puff
The Sword Qi pierced through his throat.
";You really killed him!"; Lu Yuan was shocked.
";I was a mountain thief, but I know there's nothing good about mountain thieves. Those who harbor mountain thieves are even worse. If I want to change my identity, I'll do it thoroughly. From now on, I will not share the sky with evil!"; Jiang Ming laughed.
Then he soared into the air, heading towards the foot of the mountain, and shouted loudly, ";Chang Qing, kill for me!";
";Yes!";
Chang Qing's spirit was greatly boosted.
Xiao Ming was an Innate powerhouse, who had forced them to retreat and defend the peak, only to be easily killed by the Great Village Master.
Impressive, awesome, a bright future.
The others were also excited, howling as they killed towards the foot of the mountain.
Jiang Ming had already started a killing spree.
With the Six Meridians Divine Sword, he killed the leaders of three mountain villages as if he was entering an uninhabited territory.
When he felt it was almost enough, he stopped.
Chang Qing had already arrived, swinging his blade, gathering the Killing Qi and reaping life like the Death God.
Soon, those who were to die died, and those who were to submit submitted.
";I pay homage to the Great Village Master!"; Chang Qing wiped his face, flinging out a string of beads of blood, knelt down on one knee in front of Jiang Ming, his face full of admiration, ";On the way, we collected a total of eighty thousand taels of silver, one hundred and eight Cultivation Skills, and more than three hundred experts. But nearly half of them died.";
";Good, not bad!"; Jiang Ming was very satisfied, ";Attack the nearest mountain village and occupy it first.";
";Yes!"; Chang Qing's fighting spirit soared.
The nearest mountain village is Baiyun Village.
It didn't take long to easily occupy it. But Chang Qing didn't rest, leading the people to attack two other mountain villages.
In the Hall.
Two maids served fruit plates and poured tea tremblingly, standing on the side and trembling.
";You really want to rule the mountain as king!"; Lu Yuan sat on the side, looking at Jiang Ming weirdly, ";Mountain thief, disliked by the Righteous Path. If Mount Dependence City spreads the word out, you will be defined as a demon, and you will be hunted by the whole world's Tianxia Sects.";
He was somewhat gloating.
";So what?"; Jiang Ming didn't even lift his head, flipping through a Cultivation Skill book in his hand, titled: Spiral Nine Shadows.


CHAPTER-20
20 Chapter 20: The Great Killing Spree

Jiang Ming didn't care.
He really didn't care.
With his own strength, there weren't many people in the world that made him apprehensive. As for being besieged by the powerful of several major sects?
The Xiao and Liang families of Mount Dependence City didn't have that much influence.
The world was in chaos, there were countless bandits, and many forces would be watching, not wanting to get involved without a huge incentive.
Mount Dependence City, Xiao Family.
In the main hall, there were broken pieces on the ground, obviously from shattered teacups.
Family Head Xiao Yingcheng's face was terrifyingly gloomy, releasing murderous intent but forcibly restraining it: ";Great Village Master? He actually killed Ming'er? How dare he? How could he? Doesn't he know that Ming'er is my son? The treasure of the Xiao Family? Who gave him the guts!";
";Good, good, very good!";
";I will lead the family elites to capture him, light sky lanterns, and dismember him. I will exterminate his nine generations!";
Xiao Yingcheng was extremely angry.
";Control your anger!"; The elder next to him, with slightly narrowed eyes, suddenly shouted loudly, making the hall buzz. ";You are the head of the Xiao Family first, and then Xiao Ming's father.";
Xiao Yingcheng's face twisted, but he closed his eyes and sat down, taking a deep breath. He forcibly suppressed the rage in his heart but his voice still trembled: ";Second Uncle, you know that Ming'er is our meticulously cultivated genius. He is the future of the Xiao Family. Now he is dead at the hands of a nameless person, right under our noses. I can't bear it. Second Uncle, I am now only full of anger and hatred, and not suitable to make decisions. You arrange it!";
";Alright!"; Second Uncle nodded, ";A team of hundreds suddenly attacked here. They killed many bandits and mountain thieves along their way. Perhaps they are from the Court.";
";The leader of the team is called Commander, an evident military title.";
";They cultivated a single type of sword skill, extremely ferocious, with perfect cooperation. Only the military could train such a team.";
";The later Great Village Master? Such a name might be to deceive people. According to the information returned, he easily passed through the blockade of three villages to reach Ming'er.";
";Someone saw Ming'er's long sword being pinched by his fingers and then pierced Ming'er's throat with one finger.";
";With Ming'er's strength, unless it was a master-level figure, it would be impossible to kill so easily.";
";Lu Yuan has also appeared.";
";You should know Lu Yuan. Although he has no sect or background and is friends with many people in the world, he also has some connections with us. But he just watched Ming'er get killed, which doesn't match his character.";
";I suspect the Court is going to make a move on us.";
";Only the Court could easily hide a master-level expert.";
";Rumors from the outside world say that the Shaoyang Scripture has appeared here, and the situation will become very chaotic.";
";We cannot move hastily, but we cannot let this vengeance go unanswered!";
";Let's use the mountain bandits who stole our 100,000 taels of silver cargo and cash as an excuse. In order to vent our anger, whoever destroys the village will get the goods, the silver, and a thousand-year-old ginseng. Then, use the appearance of the Shaoyang Scripture in the village as a lure. There will definitely be a large number of martial artists coming to snatch it. After that, just find someone to spread the word that they got the silver.";
";Also, send people to guard the surroundings and prevent them from escaping.";
";We will watch from the shadows and wait for an opportunity.";
";If it really is the Court, eliminate the people of the Six Gates in the city.";
Second Uncle's words were well-organized.
That day, the Xiao Family passed the news out.
Undercurrents surged in Mount Dependence City, and many rumors circulated, saying that the legendary Shaoyang Scripture had appeared in Baiyun Village.
Baiyun Village.
Jiang Ming was sitting in a courtyard, surrounded by a pile of books that he was constantly flipping through.
He had already collected many.
Now there were even more in these three villages, nearly a hundred more, which made Jiang Ming overjoyed, so he kept reading.
After finishing each book, he would close his eyes and ponder, turning the knowledge into his own foundation.
Although his cultivation level hadn't increased, his temperament had changed imperceptibly, as if he was ethereal and light, blending into the natural world and as heavy as a mountain.
";Great Village Master!"; Chang Qing walked in, placed a bowl of medicinal meal on the table, and respectfully saluted, ";Would you like to invite Miss Lan over?";
";No need!"; Jiang Ming pointed to the stool next to him. Chang Qing didn't sit down, but he didn't mind and said, ";You are a commander now, not a mountain bandit anymore. Remember, don't call me the Great Village Master, call me the Commander. Your squad will be called the Heavenly Martial Army.";
";Heavenly Martial Army? Yes, Commander!"; Chang Qing was delighted and even a little excited.
From now on, he would no longer be a mountain bandit.
As for why he was called Heavenly Martial? He didn't understand, but he didn't care.
";You hurry up and train your troops. A tough battle is coming soon. Don't forget to tighten our defenses, just guard Baiyun Village, and strengthen our vigilance."; Jiang Ming said, ";In the next two days, I will further perfect the Seven Kills Sword Skill, and you also need to cultivate hard, striving to step into the Innate Realm.";
";Yes!";
When Chang Qing left, Lu Yuan suddenly jumped in, panting, and his eyes lit up when he saw the medicinal meal.
Just as he was about to reach for it, he saw Jiang Ming take it away, and couldn't help but say, ";Brother Jiang, you are too stingy. You've eaten several ginsengs in these two days, and I'm running around for you, gathering information, but you won't even let me drink a bowl. This short fuse of mine";
";Oh, you want to do it?"; Jiang Ming drank the bowl in one gulp, chewing on the ginseng and laughing.
Lu Yuan raised his hand, but helplessly said, ";You are the most shameless among my friends!";
Immediately afterward, he said seriously, ";There is news in Mount Dependence City that mountain bandits have arrogantly stolen 100,000 taels of silver cargo and 100,000 taels of cash from the Xiao Family, as well as a thousand-year-old ginseng, and are hiding in Baiyun Village. Publicly saying whoever gets it can keep it. Who can resist such a temptation? There is also news that the Shaoyang Scripture has appeared in the village. This must be the doing of the Xiao Family, agitating a large number of martial artists to come and fight for it. By tomorrow at the latest, people will come, so you better be careful.";
";The Xiao Family is too cautious!"; Jiang Ming said in surprise, ";Not taking revenge personally, but inciting martial artists to come?";
";I'm surprised too!"; Lu Yuan picked up the teapot and began to drink heavily.
";It's good this way. Let my Heavenly Martial Army practice.";
";Heavenly Martial Army?"; Lu Yuan paused and reacted, saying with amazement, ";You really want to go straight? But it's not done like this. Who would admit it? It will also make the Court misunderstand that you want to rebel. If the army surrounds and suppresses you, haha, that would be fun!";
";That's true!"; Jiang Ming scratched his head.
He hadn't thought about this when he named Chang Qing and the others casually.
";Forget it, come on, let's see if I can suppress 100,000 soldiers single-handedly.";
";Your boasting can cover the sky.";
The following day.
Fights continued at the foot of the mountain, but none came up.
Nearing noon, Jiang Ming finally stretched his legs and came out.
";It's time to make a move. I hope there are some good things."; Jiang Ming thought as he walked down the mountain.
Starting from today, he decided to make a name for himself, preparing for the next step in his plan.


CHAPTER-21
21 Chapter 21: Using the Divine Skill

At the foot of the mountain.
Jiang Ming silently stood on a tree, observing the battle.
He didn't make a move below the Innate level.
";The Seven Kills Sword Skill I deduced before is ultimately flawed and has too many drawbacks."; As he watched and pondered, he also spied on the attackers' means: every slash, stab, punch, and kick, all flowing into his heart.
Reverse deduction, forward evolution.
He even guessed most of the corresponding mental technique's movements.
Suddenly, he moved sideways, blocking in front of a person.
This was an Innate realm powerhouse, concealing his Qi, planning to take advantage of the chaos to go up the mountain.
";Get lost!";
The middle-aged man became furious when he realized he had been discovered. A fierce and extraordinary slash was aimed at Jiang Ming's head, with Qi flowing on the blade.
Jiang Ming dodged and fought with the opponent together.
With ease, he barely suppressed the opponent, forcing him to use his trump card.
";Ordinary!"; After forcing out the opponent's foundation, Jiang Ming pointed at his heart, killing him on the spot. He once again returned to the tree, overlooking the surroundings, taking in the whole situation.
The sound of battle gradually diminished, and this wave was over.
Chang Qing came to the bottom of the tree and paid his respects to Jiang Ming: ";Commander, if we continue to fight like this, I'm afraid we won't be able to hold on for long.";
";What do you think we should do?"; Jiang Ming asked. ";It won't be peaceful in the next few days.";
Chang Qing pondered: ";Continuing to defend like this definitely isn't the solution, but our team is a mix of both good and bad. Only during battle can we quickly improve. Commander, how about dividing our forces into several waves? The experienced warriors can lead the newcomers. When they get tired, they can be replaced by the next team.";
";Go ahead!";
";Yes!";
Chang Qing respectfully retreated.
Lu Yuan arrived, standing on another branch. He asked perplexedly, ";I don't understand, why don't you directly manage this team you created? Apart from the original members, most of the team members only know of Commander Chang Qing and not you. Aren't you afraid of anything?";
";Afraid of what?"; Jiang Ming laughed. ";As long as great power resides in oneself, there's no fear of any changes. As for the Heavenly Martial Army? I just created them casually to help me collect various martial arts. I'll let them do the rest.";
";Your talent and abilities are unparalleled, but your actions are too strange, hard to see through and guess. Instead of figuring out why you do these things, it's better to sleep comfortably and watch the show."; Lu Yuan yawned and laid down on a branch, propping up his legs. Meanwhile, he continued, ";It's difficult to climb the Back Mountain from the cliff side. I'll go and check it occasionally. Sigh, I'm destined to be busy and I don't even get paid for it.";
Jiang Ming just smiled and didn't pay him any attention.
With his eyes slightly closed, he replayed all the fights he had seen earlier in his mind: various sword moves, different sword angles, the force exerted in each slash, and so on, endlessly colliding.
He also reviewed the many cultivation skills and techniques he observed from the attacking powerhouses, which flashed through his mind and formed a Martial Arts Torrent, igniting a fire of wisdom.
Clang
After a long time, a sword Qi burst out from Jiang Ming's head, cutting off all the branches and leaves above. The resting Lu Yuan suddenly felt a chilling sensation and immediately moved sideways. He looked at Jiang Ming with suspicion and amazement.
";What a terrifying sword Qi, filled with killing, ruthlessness, cruelty, resolution, death, and an unyielding spirit."; Lu Yuan licked his dry lips. ";This is the sword technique created by the Seven Kills Sword Skill. No, it's even more horrifying. This youngster has reinedvented the Seven Kills Sword Skill, taking it a step further, definitely entering the level of a divine skill.";
";If this new sword technique is passed on to the Heavenly Martial Army, then"; Lu Yuan shuddered and his face changed color.
Chang Qing also noticed the commotion over here and came to sense Jiang Ming's aura and the sword Qiabove his head, becoming ecstatic.
He could feel the joy and excitement of the Qi in his body, as well as a sense of being suppressed.
";This is definitely an advanced version of the Seven Kills Sword Skill. As expected of our Commander, he's incredible."; Chang Qing's gaze became extremely hot as he looked at Jiang Ming.
Back in the Black Wind Village, he was just a Third-tier cultivation level. After joining forces with Jiang Ming, he not only became the Third Fortress Leader but was also taught various divine skills.
Moreover, the Commander even personally used his Qi to cleanse his meridians and marrow because he felt that Chang Qing's strength was too low to control his subordinates, forcefully improving Chang Qing's cultivation.
Without that, even with the Seven Kills Sword Skill, it would be impossible for him to reach the First-tier realm.
After a long time, the sword Qi disappeared, and Jiang Ming's terrifying aura was completely restrained.
Jiang Ming opened his eyes, and a flash of sharpness seemed to pass by. He moved to Chang Qing's side in an instant, and without saying a word, pointed his finger at the other's forehead.
Chang Qing didn't show any intention of avoiding the touch.
";Focus on your mind and carefully comprehend!"; Jiang Ming's voice also reached him.
";Brother Jiang, what is this?"; Lu Yuan showed confusion.
";Teaching skills.";
";Teaching skills? Just with a finger?";
Lu Yuan was astounded.
What kind of divine technique was that?
However, Jiang Ming didn't intend to explain.
As his cultivation improved, although he hadn't acquired a third talent, his Soul Dominator power also increased accordingly.
The most intuitive feeling was that his spirit had skyrocketed, forming a wider Spiritual Domain' for observation, and the weight of the items he could control had increased tenfold.
As for teaching divine skills, it was a natural and small trick that he realized.
There were other techniques to explore as well.
In fact, that was the real reason why he didn't fear the powerful in the world.
Chang Qing sat down cross-legged and closed his eyes, his aura fluctuating wildly at first before eventually stabilizing, becoming more refined and sharp.
He seemed to have transformed into a long blade, ready to kill at any moment.
After a while, he leaped up and drew out his long blade to practice.
The swordplay was crisp and decisive, murderous aura condensed, each slash ruthless and resolute. Lu Yuan watched with his heart pounding, especially the killing qi contained in the swordplay, which made him extremely serious.
";What a terrifying swordplay, able to integrate killing qi into it. If there was a whole team like this, one slash would"; Lu Yuan's heart leaped.
";The Seven Kills Sword Skill I've deduced has reached the level of mastery, do you want to learn?"; Jiang Ming asked with a smile.
";You really are, truly a demon among geniuses."; Lu Yuan didn't know what to say.
Before him was a talent that defied the world, unparalleled in all eternity.
Creating top-notch skills just by deducing and practicing.
He was being crushed to the point of almost going into seclusion.
Otherwise, with his unrestrained nature, why would he stay by Jiang Ming's side all the time?
";Will the condensed killing qi affect my mind?"; Lu Yuan asked with a sigh.
";The previous one would, but the current one is much better!"; Jiang Ming laughed, ";This is a method of training using killing to stop killing, to cultivate with killing, and to refine the spirit with killing. Condensing killing qi can also continuously temper the mind. As long as one's mental strength is not too poor, the impact should be minimal, at least not within the realm of a Grandmaster. However, the heavy killing qi won't last in the long run. I'll continue to explore in the future, and try to incorporate the path of tranquillity. With a pure heart, control the way of slaughter. Harbor light within, and suppress the world with killing.";
";You're amazing!"; Lu Yuan gave a thumbs up.
If anyone else said this, he would definitely scoff and call them boastful.
But the one before him could really do what he said.
";I know I'm amazing, no need for daily praise, do you want to learn? This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."; Jiang Ming said meaningfully.
";Learn!"; Lu Yuan's face changed continuously, and finally, he nodded in agreement.
The other party said it was an opportunity, and it certainly wouldn't be too bad.
Jiang Ming touched his finger on Lu Yuan's forehead, his spirit and soul power pouring out, flowing into the other's Sea of Consciousness.
With Lu Yuan's Master-level Realm cultivation, sensing the spiritual fluctuations, he might gain something from it, or at least be able to perceive a new world.
This was the opportunity.


CHAPTER-22
22 Chapter 22: Furious Rage

With the divine skill, the sword technique is directly demonstrated in his mind, clearly understood, and all kinds of techniques are imprinted in his heart, never forgotten.
The efficiency has increased countless times.
";Thank you, Commander!"; After waking up, Chang Qing looked at Jiang Ming as if he were looking at an immortal.
";After you've become proficient, teach it to others!";
";Yes!"; Chang Qing retreated, his steps more confident.
At this time, Lu Yuan also opened his eyes, and his gaze towards Jiang Ming was extraordinarily complicated: ";This method is indeed a great opportunity. Shall I worship you as my master?";
";Kneel down!"; Jiang Ming smiled, pointing at his feet.
";Kneel your ass!"; Lu Yuan rolled his eyes.
In the following days, Chang Qing divided the team into three parts, taking turns guarding, one group for four hours.
At the same time, he also passed on the cultivation skills.
Those newly recruited cultivated the first version of the Seven Kills Sword Skill, and the original old men cultivated Jiang Ming's rediscovered technique.
They honed and improved themselves through slaughter.
Under the night.
In Mount Dependence City, on a street corner, there was a small tavern with closed doors. Inside, the lamplight flickered, and two elders sat facing each other.
Two small dishes and a pot of wine.
One of them was Xiao Yuanhai, the second uncle of the Head of the Xiao Family. He picked up the wine pot and poured two cups: ";Old man, how long has it been since we sat together and had a drink?";
";Almost ten years."; The Liang Family Elder, Liang Dashan, smiled and said, ";In the blink of an eye, we old folks are half-buried in the yellow soil.";
";Isn't that the truth!"; Xiao Yuanhai took a sip and put down his wine cup. ";What do you think of what's been happening these past few days?";
";Use your eyes and see!"; Liang Dashan laughed, then said seriously, ";The thieves in Baiyun Village have unknown origins, but they claim to be Heavenly Martial Army. Their numbers are small, but they are exceptionally powerful and fearless. Those martial artists all fought for themselves but had various methods, and even with Innate powerful ones joining, they still couldn't charge up the mountain.";
";A total of seven Innate powerful ones have died.";
";Mysterious origins, claiming to be an army, unmatched strength, and seamless military formations. I can only think of one possibility  it's the court.";
";But they are so brazen, even killing Xiao Ming. So the target can only be us.";
";The court is in chaos, and the world is in turmoil, but they point their knives at us. Hah, they must think we're easy to bully.";
Liang Dashan revealed a chilling, cold smile.
";In that case, we have to join forces again!";
";Being forced to this point, of course, we must join forces and take the opportunity to uproot the Six Gates in the city.";
";Also, comb through the forces within the city.";
";Very well!";
The two reached an agreement.
At midnight, in the courtyard on the mountain.
Jiang Ming sat facing the moon, half-hearted, cultivating and contemplating the further evolution of various extraordinary cultivation techniques.
At this time, Lu Yuan walked in, followed by a woman dressed in black: ";Brother Jiang, let me introduce you to a friend. This is Gold Chapter Constable Jin Yinhua from the Six Gates of Mount Dependence City. Miss Jin has come to discuss something with you. Give me some face and don't bully her, or I won't be able to explain it to Constable Zhang Tong, nor will I face Lord Wang Wudi.";
";Constable Jin, this is their Commander."; Lu Yuan winked at Jiang Ming, then jumped to sit on a tree nearby, took out his wine gourd from his waist, and drank facing the moon.
";Constable Jin, please!"; Jiang Ming pointed to the opposite side.
";Brother Jiang!"; Even with a special hat, Jin Yinhua looked handsome, especially her cute, plump cheeks. She did not look like someone from the Six Gates at all.
She sat down without hesitation and went straight to the point: ";Which part does Brother Jiang belong to?";
Jiang Ming was slightly taken aback, and then he chuckled: ";Constable Jin, you misunderstand. The Heavenly Martial Army does not belong to any part. I just thought it sounded nice, so I chose that name. Nowadays, bandits are rampant, corrupt officials are in power, and the people are displaced, living in hardship. I thought that since I'm in this world, I should do something within my ability. So, I created this army, intending to eliminate all the bandits in the world, and that brought me here.";
";Created an army?"; constable Jin widened her eyes and then frowned, ";Brother Jiang, you have a great ambition to care for the country and the people. I admire that. But, creating an army violates the imperial taboo. Once reported, you will be besieged.";
She couldn't help but smirk and commented: ";No wonder the Xiao family has been monitoring us lately. They misunderstood that we are from the court. Even we were mistaken, and Constable had tried to investigate through special channels, but there was too little time to verify.";
Pfft
Lu Yuan, who was on the tree, spat out the wine in his mouth.
Jiang Ming's mouth twitched.
He had never thought about this point.
He just wanted to clear the name of Black Wind Mountain and leave some legacy.
But he didn't expect such a huge misunderstanding.
";Why not go with the flow!"; Jiang Ming changed his mind and laughed, ";I heard that both the Xiao and Liang families are harboring mountain bandits and committing atrocities. How about we cooperate and uproot them both?";
";I can't make that decision!"; Constable Jin stood up and made a fist salute, ";I need to consult with Constable. Also, I have a piece of news for you. Tomorrow, the Xiao Family will launch a full-scale attack on Baiyun Village. The Xiao family has two Grandmasters, seven or eight experts in the Innate Realm, and they have secretly built the Black Iron Army. As for the Liang family, they are not far behind. There are also many disciples from other sects in the city, and if they come to help, even if you win, you may become an enemy of many sects.";
";Excuse me!"; Constable Jin leaped out of the courtyard.
";Thank you!"; Jiang Ming sent his voice to her.
Lu Yuan landed beside him, unable to hold back his laughter: ";Now I understand why the Xiao family is so cautious. The Heavenly Martial Army, an army, anyone would think too much. Haha, Brother Jiang, you really made a big misunderstanding by accident. I'm afraid that even when Zhang Tong hears the news, he would want to kill you. He will be in a very difficult situation.";
Jiang Ming agreed completely.
An militia appeared in his territory, and he couldn't escape the responsibility no matter what.
";It depends on his courage!"; Jiang Ming stood up, stepped on the ground, and landed gently on the roof.
He raised his hand and grabbed at the bright moon, then said, ";Brother Lu, what if I kill all of them tomorrow?";
";No, absolutely not!"; Lu Yuan's face changed, ";If you exterminate the Xiao and Liang families, that's fine, because they deserve death. But if you kill off the disciples from other sects who come along, you will become the enemy of the Righteous Path, and be the enemy of the world. Even the Six Gates will take advantage of the situation to besiege you. By then, there will be no place for you in this world. You should consider the Heavenly Martial Army and the Black Wind Village.";
";Troublesome!"; Jiang Ming whispered, ";It's better without any ties.";
Ultimately, he still felt detached from this world and found it hard to fit in.
But he couldn't ignore the involvement of the Black Wind Mountain.
However, this sentence made Lu Yuan feel a chilling sensation.
Knowing the situation was urgent, Constable Jin abandoned her horse and used her light skill to return to Mount Dependence City before daybreak.
She was almost exhausted.
After explaining the situation to Zhang Tong
";Create an army? Jiang Ming, I curse your ancestors!"; Constable Zhang Tong was furious, pointing towards the direction of Baiyun Village and cursing loudly, ";I'm going to be screwed by you. And that scoundrel Lu Yuan, not giving a heads up in advance, how am I going to report this to my superiors?";
";Sir, is it that serious?";
";It's not a matter of how serious it is, but whether I will lose my head. No, I must report this to Lord Wang. Otherwise, I'll have to run away. Create an army? Is that something a person should do? It's challenging the imperial power, the military, the court, and the Six Gates. Damn it!";


CHAPTER-23
23 Chapter 23: Becoming a Buddha on the Spot

Early morning.
A hundred meters outside the Ximen City, Jiang Ming was already seated on a piece of green stone, blocking the path to Baiyun Village.
Lu Yuan's words had stirred him up the day before.
Together with the information provided by Constable Jin, he had been able to eliminate most of the top-tier powerful people hiding in the vicinity of Baiyun Village early on.
He instructed Chang Qing to lead the Heavenly Martial Army to take out the rest and further strengthen their forces. Then they rushed over here, where the battlefield would be set up.
Jiang Ming wanted to enter the city directly, but his heart softened when he saw the common people on the way. After all, a battle with a Grandmaster-level powerful person would inevitably affect a large area, endangering countless lives.
The first to enter the city were the peasants, some carrying chickens, others carrying eggs, and some carrying vegetables. They had set out at nightfall, hoping to enter the city early and get a good price for their produce.
";The lowest stratum is the largest and also the most hardworking.";
Jiang Ming suppressed the turbulence in his heart.
His ears perked up and sounds were coming from the City Gate.
";Hey, the Xiao family has really lost its shame, sending out invitations for the various factions to join together in attacking Baiyun Village.";
";It definitely won't be that simple. So many people have tried to take down Baiyun Village these days, but what has happened? Most of them didn't come back. The Xiao family must feel it's difficult to handle, so they are inviting many powerful people to join forces and take down Baiyun Village. This is a way to buy a reputation and strengthen their might.";
";The Xiao family can't handle Baiyun Village with their strength alone? That's bullshit! It's been strange from the very beginning. I think they want to shift everyone's focus. Don't forget, the Shaoyang Scripture was initially rumored to be around here, and all kinds of powerful figures converged. Suddenly, it was said to be in Baiyun Village. Look at how many forces have come to the city now  the Chunyang Sect, the Zhen Wu Sect, the Dalin Temple, and even the Demon Sect have powerful people here. If they don't shift their focus elsewhere, in case there is unrest, Mount Dependence City might be left in tatters.";
";That's the most likely explanation. Hey, let's not concern ourselves with that. Let's hurry along, get to Baiyun Village first and hide, and then sneak up after the great war breaks out. Ginseng and silver banknotes—if we can get the Shaoyang Scripture, hehe, our brothers will be rich.";
";It's best to sneak up from the Back Mountain.";
Hearing this, Jiang Ming stood up and walked over.
Invitations from the Xiao family?
They were really determined to label Baiyun Village as bandits and invite the Tianxia Sects to attack them.
";This road is blocked!"; Jiang Ming stood in front of the three men.
";Kid, are you looking for trouble?!"; The frontmost man was a bonze, carrying a Water-Fire Zen Staff in his hand, his face full of fierce features and an imposing demeanor.
";Stopping people outside the city gates to be a robber? Heh, you must be new. You haven't grown your hair fully yet, huh. Hurry home and feed, it'll save you from losing your head!"; Another man said.
But Jiang Ming said nothing and took action directly.
The three men had decent strength—one was at the Innate realm and the other two were at first-tier. They were no ordinary people in the world of martial arts.
";How dare you?!"; The bonze was furious, and his attack caused thunder in the air.
Jiang Ming effortlessly pushed back the three men.
Looking at their moves and steps, he absorbed their martial arts knowledge, turned it into his own foundation, and strengthened his accumulations.
In just a moment, he had squeezed out everything they had learned. Then he used the Six Meridians Divine Sword to pierce through the three men's wrists, and with a flick of his sleeve, he forced them all back.
";A small lesson to teach a bigger one, dare to covet Baiyun Village again, death!"; Jiang Ming leaped back to the green stone and sat down. ";I am the Commander of Baiyun Village, Jiang Ming.";
After that, he closed his eyes.
The three people's faces were ugly, especially the injuries on their wrists, which made them even more uneasy.
If Jiang Ming had not been merciful, they would be
Dead!
They reluctantly bowed and hastily retreated back into the city, spreading the news that the leader of Baiyun Village was blocking the western city gate.
The news spread fast.
More and more powerful people were rushing towards the area, but all were staying in the distance, looking at Jiang Ming with some dread.
";Amitabha Buddha!"; A young monk approached with a compassionate expression on his face but a sharp light in his eyes.
He stopped two meters away.
";I am Disciple Huijian of Dalin Temple, and you must be Jiang Ming, the leader of Baiyun Village, Chang Qing?"; Huijian asked politely, his voice gentle.
";That's right!"; Jiang Ming looked at him. ";Huijian, I've heard of you; you are the most talented disciple of Dalin Temple's current generation, with the strength of the Innate Peak, capable of contending with the average Grandmaster level powerful person. So, you want to get involved too?";
";Baiyun Village is a gathering place for mountain thieves, and there has been too much killing recently. I have come to resolve grudges and persuade the people of Baiyun Village to put down their butcher knives, repent for their sins, and start anew, clearing the air and putting an end to the killing."; Huijian gently responded, ";As for the donor, you should return to Dalin Temple with me, recite scriptures every day, and let go of the killing thoughts in your heart. As the saying goes, when one puts down the butcher's knife, one instantly becomes a Buddha.";
";So you mean if someone kills and then repents for their sins, they can become a Buddha?"; Jiang Ming's expression took a bizarre turn.
";Amitabha Buddha!"; Huijian chanted a Buddhist mantra, ";Recognize oneself, sincerely repent, and that is putting down the butcher's knife; recite scriptures daily, pray every night, and your heart will turn towards goodness, so you can indeed become a Buddha.";
";Can the Demon Sect members who slaughtered towns and cities and committed countless murders also go to Dalin Temple and become Buddhas? Can they just repent for their sins and be exempted from punishment after killing your parents? Can they read a few scriptures after killing your Master and act as if nothing happened?"; Jiang Ming asked with a smile.
";Donor, you are twisting my words."; Huijian's face darkened.
";According to what you said, isn't that the case?"; Jiang Ming laughed and said, ";Why is it twisting words when it comes from my mouth? According to the teachings of your Dalin Temple, all the sinners in the world can go to the Dalin Temple to repent and atone without receiving any punishment, even trample on the laws of the court, and even let go of the enmity of their parents, wives, and children.";
Huijian's face turned as dark as water.
";If a butcher can atone for his sins and even become a Buddha, what about the people who get killed?"; Jiang Ming asked again. ";Do they deserve to die? To be kind to sinners is the greatest blasphemy to good people and the greatest evil.";
";You're forcing your argument!"; Huijian was furious.
";Ha ha!"; Jiang Ming laughed. ";Isn't this what you said? Why is it forcing when it comes from me? According to you, if I destroy the Big Buddha Temple and then put my hands together, chanting Amitabha Buddha,' I can become a Buddha too, right? If I kill your Buddha and then put down my sword, reading scriptures, can I become your Buddha too?";
";Amitabha Buddha! You twist Buddha's teachings, commit serious sins, and must be a demon head reincarnate, blaspheme my Buddha, and should be executed!"; Huijian struck immediately.
";Tsk tsk tsk, this is Buddha!"; Jiang Ming dodged a blow and continued, ";According to what you said, even demon heads can become Buddhas if they put down their butcher's knife. How can it be executed when you're executing a future Buddha?";
";Seeking death!"; Huijian, enraged, attacked with even greater ferocity.
His palms flew and shattered the rocks.
";Tongue Blooming Lotus, everything can become a Buddha, but not a Buddha, it should be executed, wonderful, haha, wonderful!"; Jiang Ming couldn't help laughing again, engaging in a battle with Huijian.
He forcefully suppressed Huijian, forcing him to use all his learning continuously.


CHAPTER-24
24 Chapter 24 Beyond the World

Thousand Buddha Hands, Flower Picking Finger, Demonic Suppression Robe Technique, Great Vajra Finger, and so on.
As expected of the genius disciple of Dalin Temple, his strength is great. Among all below the Grandmaster's level, and within the Innate level, he definitely ranks first.
But in comparison, he still falls short.
However, the ultimate martial art wielded by Huijian certainly has its unique aspects.
Crowds are gathering in the not so distant area, many people showing sneering expressions.
";Huijian, never thought I would see the day you would lose your temper in shame."; Chunyang Sect Disciple Tang Xiaotian cradles his long sword, laughingly speaks.
";Rattled by Commander Jiang's successive questioning, he exposed the hypocrisy of Buddhism, and Huijian's state of mind was disturbed, upsetting his Buddhist principles."; Zhen Wu Sect disciple Bai Yunfei stands with his hands held behind his back, he also laughs, ";To put down the butcher's knife and to attain Buddhahood on the spot, although it is about letting go of worldly attachments, it has been twisted by Dalin Temple into a principle which has turned into a place that harbors evil.";
";Commander Jiang once said something good: kindness to the sinner is the greatest blasphemy to the good, and that is the greatest evil. His words indeed make sense!"; Says a young man carrying a long sword. He is from Divine Sword Villa.
Many people nodded, expressing their agreement.
Xiao Yingcheng also came, standing in the crowd.
Observing the two who are dueling, he analyzed Jiang Ming's strength: ";He is holding back a lot, shouldn't he be? Since he dares to stand here, he should be overwhelmingly strong, making others fear to act. What's going on right now? Is he wary of Dalin Temple? It shouldn't be, based on his past behavior.";
";No matter what, since he dares to come here, he has to die.";
";It's best if he first kills Huijian, and then Tang Xiaotian, Bai Yunfei, and He Qianshan.";
Xiao Yingcheng thought maliciously.
The battlefield!
";Little monk, if you admit that letting go of the butcher's knife and attaining Buddhahood on the spot is a twisted doctrine, how about I spare your life?"; Jiang Ming suddenly speaks up.
";Those who blaspheme Buddha, die!"; Huijian's rage burns up to the ninth heaven.
But within his heart, he is more amazed at Jiang Ming's strength.
He understands, he is not an opponent, not an opponent at all.
Yet he also has faith that the other party would not dare to kill him.
To kill him means to be enemies with Dalin temple.
Even the Sun and Moon Demon Sect must weigh their options before they consider killing him.
";Then I'll go and attain Buddha."; With a flash of coldness in his eyes, Jiang Ming pointed like a sword, pierced through the defense, and pointed at Huijian's brow.
";Golden Bell Shield!"; Huijian shouts furiously. His Qi disperses outside his body, forming a golden glow of defense, like a large bell encapsulating his body. Unfortunately, it could not block Jiang Ming's pointed finger.
His defense was broken and hit between the eyebrows.
";How could you dare"; Huijian shows a shocked expression.
Even if the defense could not be held, it should at least resist a little, but the result was as if the power of the Golden Bell Shield was made of paper.
What made him incredulous was that Jiang Ming really dared to kill him.
";Does relinquishing the butcher knife truly make an error? Can I really attain Buddhahood?"; Lost in confusion, Huijian falls to the ground, dead.
The powerful observers were all stunned.
";You actually dared to kill!"; Bai Yunfei was astonished.
Tang Xiaotian was shocked.
He Qianshan was surprised.
Xiao Yingcheng was overjoyed.
";Amitabha Buddha!"; Jiang Ming clasped his hands together, devoutly chanting a Buddhist mantra. He looked at the people in the distance and laughed, ";Everyone, I have now completely cleared my karmic debt.";
Bai Yunfei's corners of his mouth twitched: ";Commander Jiang, you're a real character.";
";Thank you for your undeserved praise!"; Jiang Ming acknowledged gratefully. ";After achieving my learning, I wanted to do something for the world. So I led this group of people to start with the extermination of bandits, came here, and suppressed three mountain bandit villages. But Xiao Ming from the Xiao Family was in the village, opposing us with the bandits, and we ended up killing him. After that, we occupied Baiyun Village as an intermittent stopping point. Who knows, the Xiao Family slandered us, saying that there is one hundred thousand taels of goods, gold and thousand-year-old ginseng and the Shaoyang Scripture hidden in Baiyun Village. If those things really existed, wouldn't the Xiao Family take it for themselves? This is just utter nonsense!";
";Clearly, they just want to use all of you to turn against me!";
";Everyone, today it's the grudge between me, Jiang Ming, and the Xiao Family.";
";If you don't want to get involved, please leave and observe from afar. Otherwise, you are an enemy.";
";If you're my enemy, I don't care if you're right or wrong, just or evil, or about your identity, it's all a matter of life and death!";
Jiang Ming raised his hand and shouted loudly: ";Xiao Yingcheng, your son was killed by me, and you're still cowering? Could it be that your wife cheated on you, and you don't want to seek revenge?";
This sentence could be considered extremely venomous.
It is simply a heart-wrenching statement.
";Jiang Ming, you're courting death!"; Xiao Yingcheng was enraged, he leaped out, especially after hearing the snickering from the dark, his fury reached its peak, his eyes turned red.
All the members of the Xiao family also came out one after another, surrounding Jiang Ming in the middle, blocking his way.
Bai Yunfei and the others hesitated briefly, but finally retreated to a distance. It was clear from their stance that they didn't want to get involved, they were just there to watch the excitement.
Still, there were many who wanted a piece of the action.
More often, those who were at odds with the Xiao family stood behind them.
There were as many as hundreds of them.
The city wall was also filled with silhouettes.
There were also figures flickering in the dark.
";I am indeed seeking death!"; Jiang Ming laughed, ";Is it a single fight or a group fight, would you draw the line?";
";Commander Jiang, you mean you alone will fight against all of them?"; Bai Yunfei, a fan of excitement, couldn't help but shout.
";You actually discerned my thoughts, good brother, how should I address you?"; Jiang Ming turned his head and asked with a smile.
As if he didn't care about Xiao Yingcheng and the others at all.
";Zhen Wu Sect, Bai Yunfei. Brother Jiang, if you don't die, I'll invite you for a drink."; Bai Yunfei cupped his hands, ";May I ask another question, Brother Jiang, do you have the Shaoyang Scripture?";
";Good, I'll take your drink. I don't have the Shaoyang Scripture, but I have over ten kinds of ultimate martial arts."; Jiang Ming said, ";Brother Bai, are you willing to exchange the ultimate martial arts of your Zhen Wu Sect? I'll let you see them first, if you're not satisfied, you can refuse.";
";Exchange of ultimate martial arts?"; Bai Yunfei gasped and said seriously, ";Brother Jiang is very bold, unfortunately, the knowledge I have is the property of the sect, it's not mine to give. However, if you were to visit Zhen Wu Sect, the old man, my master, would definitely be willing.";
";Haha, in the future, I will certainly visit Elder Zhang!"; Jiang Ming laughed, ";I also want to discuss with the old man, what's above a Grandmaster, can it break the void!";
";Break the void?"; Bai Yunfei was taken aback.
";Is there an extreme in martial arts? Do immortals exist? What lies beyond this world?"; Jiang Ming added.
Bai Yunfei was taken aback again, but his heart was filled with tumultuous waves.
Not to mention him, even the others were moved.
Who had thought about these?
Isn't the extreme of martial arts the Grandmaster?
Immortals? Isn't that just a legend?
Beyond the world? Isn't that just the stars in the sky?
Jiang Ming then revealed a smile.
He wanted to play a big game, and gaining fame was just the first step.
Proposing bold questions was the second step.
Only in this way can he quickly attract the attention of the powerful in the world.
";You should survive today first!"; Xiao Yingcheng couldn't bear it any longer and his voice boomed like thunder, ";Jiang Ming, you killed my son, cutting off the future of my Xiao family, I swear this vengeance! Everyone, whoever kills this man, my Xiao family is willing to offer 100,000 taels of silver. If you hurt him once, a thousand taels of silver.";
";Kill!"; A shout rang out, murderous intent shattered the heavens.
Some of the Xiao family were the first to take action.
With this cue, those who were itching to fight could no longer hold back, and they rushed forward one after another.
A thousand taels of silver was quite a lot.
Seize the opportunity, hack at him ten times, it would be as easy as pie.
None of them believed that with so many powerful people attacking him, Jiang Ming would be able to survive.
";Now this is interesting!"; Jiang Ming was even more excited.
The more people, the more martial arts.
And the more accumulation he could gain.
In an instant, his mind became clear, the surrounding situation was mirrored in his sea of hearts, reflecting every detail in his mind. With a move of his figure, he took the initiative to charge forward.
Jiang Ming's palm landed on a person, and his Qi entered the body. After a round within the opponent's body, he understood the operation of the heart method and harnessed it as his own nourishment.
With one expulsion of his palm power, he shattered the opponent's organs.


CHAPTER-25
25 Chapter 25: Million Times

With his heaven-defying comprehension and formidable spiritual power, Jiang Ming could steal a cultivation skill in each exchange.
His exquisite footwork could even leave behind afterimages, allowing him to shuttle back and forth among the attackers. Each of his strikes seemed not fast, but one person would die without fail.
Jiang Ming raised his eyebrows, discovering a thin sword had appeared behind him, thin to the extreme, and fast to the ultimate point.
But it was silent and stealthy.
";An assassin of the Innate Realm!";
He deduced that within the first moment.
With a backhanded thrust, his fingers flicked the thin sword away, and he turned around. His arm moved like a spirit snake, tracing its prey, and he caught the opponent's wrist. Qi flowed into his body, gaining something in a single turn of events.
With a shake of his hand, he shattered the opponent's Qi, and then a palm strike hit the chest, sending him flying out. Before hitting the ground, the man died.
The next moment, Jiang Ming's hands danced, leaving countless afterimages as if revealing a thousand hands, showing a hint of compassion.
This scene made Xiao Yingcheng, who had not hurried to take action, tighten his heart. It seemed to be caught by a giant hand, and his breathing was rapid.
";Blood Shadow Tower's gold-level assassin was killed with a single blow!";
";That's the Thousand Buddha Hands from Dalin Temple!";
";Master-level Realm, at least possessing several secret techniques. The sensitivity is extremely keen.";
He kept analyzing.
On the other side.
Bai Yunfei and others stood together, watching this siege, their blood boiling and wanting to join.
But Jiang Ming's means greatly shocked them.
";Thousand Buddha Hands, Dragon Claw Hand, Flower Picking Finger, Vajra Finger, aren't these Huijian's secret techniques? How could he know them all? Did he steal them before, or did he just learn them during the fight?";
";It must have been before. Even Master Zhang couldn't have learned an opponent's secret techniques in a fight. This is no longer human, but a myth.";
";Look, the Great Splitting Wind Palm, this is the secret technique of the Hai Family, which is not passed down; also, that kick earlier was like a huge axe splitting down; it was clearly the Vajra Axe Leg Skill, the secret technique of the Ming Family, which is also not passed down.";
";The powerful of the Hai Family and Ming Family have been to Mount Dependence City, and it seems that they died in Baiyun Village a few days ago.";
";Hiss It can't be!";
";If it's really as we guessed, then, my God, it's incredible, unbelievable, indescribable!";
";You all missed one point, his age!";
";This";
After a slight analysis, Bai Yunfei and others were all dumbfounded.
But immediately after, they found something even more horrifying.
";Someone was being killed in a panic and wanted to escape, but Jiang, Commander Jiang, seemed to have discovered it beforehand, and killed the person on the spot.";
";Is he going to slaughter them all by himself? And not even let them escape?";
";Is this guy, this guy so bloodthirsty?";
";He once said: As long as they are enemies, regardless of right or wrong, good or evil, identity, it's all about life and death! So resolute, so ruthless, it's chilling.";
";The most terrifying thing is, he kills with a single move. Whether it is Innate or below Innate, there are almost no exceptions. He is too strong and too ruthless.";
";And one more thing, the Xiao Family's people are mostly lurking on the periphery.";
";Xiao Family, heh, great plans. 100,000 taels of silver bought so many thugs.";
";What do you think, can Commander Jiang survive?";
This question silenced everyone.
The siege was not the Xiao Family's main force.
The true strength of the Xiao Family had not yet been deployed. They all knew that the Xiao Family had two Grandmaster-level powerhouses, several Innate experts, which even placed them among the top families in the world.
They might even have secret forces.
There was also the Liang Family in the city.
Even if Jiang Ming was strong, could he withstand them?
Moreover, they discovered one thing: the Xiao Family was deliberately trying to exhaust Jiang Ming's strength. Even a Great Grandmaster would probably not be able to continue fighting like this.
";He should go straight for Xiao Yingcheng!"; Bai Yunfei whispered.
He Qianshan and others silently nodded.
Exhausted?
A hint of a smile flashed at the corner of Jiang Ming's mouth.
Their conversation was completely heard, and even in the center of the battle, the whispers from the other side could be heard clearly.
";What I fear least is consumption!";
Even if the Dantian of all these people were combined, their Sea of Qi Space would still not be as vast as his.
A foot and a hundred feet seem to be a hundred times different.
However, this is a flat surface  what if it's a sphere?
A million times!
Jiang Ming has also cultivated the Longxiang Dominator Body Skill to the fifth layer.
With a few spiritual secret skills that he had deduced, Jiang Ming was truly unafraid of being besieged.
";Can't avoid it!";
Suddenly, more than ten hidden weapons shot over, and there were attackers coming from both left and right. Jiang Ming made a judgment at the first moment.
Then don't avoid it.
Ding! Ding! Ding!
Golden light flashed across his body, deflecting all hidden weapons.
This was the Golden Bell Shield.
He had already learned it.
Even without it, his body was protected by Air of Gang, making it nearly impossible for ordinary hidden weapons to kill him.
The number of corpses grew increasingly.
Those watching the battle felt an unparalleled chill.
Xiao Yingcheng had endless hatred, but at this moment, he was extremely calm, and also very fearful: ";Second Uncle, he's too strong. Even among Grandmasters, he might be at the top. Facing such a siege, he's still able to kill with ease, and his breathing isn't even disrupted. What should we do?";
";The safest method is to exhaust him.";
";Wear him to death!";
Xiao Yuanhai's face was extremely unsightly.
";But this will inevitably greatly exhaust the strength of our family.";
";So what! As long as the top combat power is there, the Xiao Family will still be the Xiao Family. No matter how much ordinary strength is consumed, it won't have much impact on the family, and can be cultivated at any time. Ordinary strength? Those are expendable, as the family head, you should have this judgment!";
";Second Uncle, I've learned my lesson!";
";Then prepare the second wave! Jiang Ming must die, even the Heavenly King cannot save him.";
Jiang Ming observed the surroundings with keen senses, his spiritual power enveloping the area, fully aware of all movements around him.
";A second wave?";
";Is there a third wave too?";
";Interesting!";
He possessed superb skills and courage, and simply didn't care.
At the same time, he was also contemplating the path of martial arts.
";Before reaching the Master-level Realm, it ultimately boils down to various fist and leg techniques, and methods of using weapons, all of which involve the application of Qi, forming various strange and powerful ways to attack.";
";Dantian is the foundation, and Qi is the function. This gives rise to various internal cultivation methods. Different circulation produces different effects.";
";The twelve main meridians and the eight extraordinary meridians branch off into countless tiny branches.";
";The use of different combat skills will create conflicts and also correspond to the flow of Qi, even forming special attributes that eventually become difficult to coexist.";
";Is it possible to create a cultivation method that can accommodate all possible combinations?";
As Jiang Ming's thoughts spread out, pleas for mercy reached his ears as well.
";Commander Jiang, I admit defeat, admit defeat! I will never participate in besieging Baiyun Village or attacking you again, please spare my life!";
";Stop, stop it, I'm a disciple of the Free School, if you dare to kill me, you're making an enemy of our school.";
They were scared of being killed.
Unable to leave, they could only swallow their pride and beg for mercy.
Jiang Ming remained unmoved, and every move was aimed at taking lives.
Suddenly, the surrounding area became empty.
Those who besieged him were all killed.
Xiao Yingcheng and others stood at a distance, and with a raised eyebrow, he gestured and yelled, ";Kill!";


CHAPTER-26
26 Chapter 26: The Four Great Grandmasters

The bowstring collapsed, and arrows fell like rain, raining down in an instant so densely that there was nowhere to hide, nowhere to evade.
";Awe-inspiring!"; Jiang Ming raised his head to watch this scene and couldn't help but exclaim.
He, indeed, didn't evade.
Vroom
The next moment, the Qi inside his body surged out, forming a thin golden light membrane outside his body, which was the Golden Bell Shield.
The arrows fell on it, causing the Qi shield to continuously indent but remain resiliently astonishing, unable to be pierced.
Vroom
However, at this moment, a succession of loud noises sounded, and long spears were seen shot down from the city wall.
No, those were crossbows, only ever seen in military use.
Fabled to kill Grandmasters, extremely terrifying, they are incomparably powerful weapons. Currently, nine of them were pointed from the city wall right in this direction.
The powerful surrounding who observed this scene all changed their expressions.
";Using the arrow rain as a curtain, the crossbow is real, let's see if you can avoid death!"; Xiao Yingcheng revealed a somewhat pleased expression, ";Even if you don't die, as long as you're hit by a single crossbow bolt, you will be severely injured, then killing you will be a joy afterward.";
On the other side.
";As expected of the Xiao Family, running Mount Dependence City for many years, forging it like an iron bucket. Even though the Six Gates sent a Constable to live here, they are still unable to suppress the dominance of the Xiao Family. Looking at the current situation, the City Defense Army has become the Xiao Family's private army, able to mobilize as they please, even using the restricted weapon, the crossbow. Isn't the Xiao Family worried about the court's plight?"; He Qianshan frowned.
";They really aren't scared!"; Bai Yunfei crossed his arms, ";The Xiao Family practically controls the City Defense Army, which represents the officials. And Commander Jiang? He's been labeled as bandit. In a fight between officers and bandits, what could be more justified? Brother Jiang is too arrogant. Facing an arrow rain without evading is one thing, as a master-level realm cultivation is unhindered. But these are crossbows, can he really block them?";
A few people silently watched.
Jiang Ming naturally also spotted the crossbows.
";Can't block it!";
He immediately made his judgment in no time, yet still didn't dodge.
";If one layer doesn't work, then two layers, three layers, four layers";
The golden light outside his body suddenly shook, and a second layer of golden light appeared, immediately followed by the third layer, the fourth layer
The nine crossbow bolts also reached close, shooting at the first layer of golden light, easily ripping it apart, then the second layer, the third layer.
Layer by layer, the golden light was torn apart, but the nine crossbow bolts eventually halted in front of him, then fell.
The golden light continued to radiate, layer by layer, circle by circle, exactly nine layers.
";The Ninth Layer of Golden Bell Shield, my God, he actually cultivated the Ninth Layer of Golden Bell Shield, even the high monks of Dalin Temple didn't succeed in cultivation, he actually cultivated it!";
Exclamations rang out one after another.
Bai Yunfei, He Qianshan, Xiao Yingcheng, and others all changed their expressions.
The Golden Bell Shield is an extraordinary defensive technique, very difficult to cultivate successfully. It's rumored that only the high monk who founded this method had successfully cultivated it, other monks who practiced this method could mostly only cultivate it to the eighth layer at most.
Even seven layers are rare.
But now, they witnessed the Ninth Layer of Golden Bell Shield.
";The unyielding cannot last long, the enduring cannot defend!";
Jiang Ming seemed to have a bit of clarity.
The Golden Bell Shield consumes too much, is too overpowering. Once incited, it's invincible and almost impenetrable, but it lacks flexible features.
It can't unload power, it can only ruggedly defend.
His face was somewhat pale, as if he had overconsumed.
While Xiao Yingcheng was somewhat frightened, he also let out a small sigh of relief: ";The Ninth Layer of Golden Bell Shield, it's going against heaven. If this child isn't eradicated, my Xiao Family will cease to exist. Fortunately, he has overconsumed.";
";I was also given quite a scare."; Xiao Yuanhai's forehead was covered in cold sweat, ";The Ninth Layer of Golden Bell Shield, even a master-level realm cultivator like me would struggle to break through it. Thankfully, he's fatigued. This is a good sign, a very good sign.";
";Then continue!"; Xiao Yingcheng waved his hand, the arrow rain descended like a waterfall, the crossbows blasted, and launched another attack.
At this moment, a figure rushed forward, his face flushed red, sweat pouring down like rain, urgently saying: ";Head of the family, the Black Iron Army is surrounded!";
";Surrounded? By who? How are they surrounded? Isn't the people from the Six Gates not moving?"; Xiao Yingcheng's colour changed and he hastily asked.
";It's the Tian Wu Army!";
";Impossible! Jiang Ming is here, as powerful as the Heavenly Martial Army is, they only have Chang Qing, a First-tier realm fighter. The Black Iron Army consists of eight hundred men, each of whom is among the elite, with many First-tier fighters and an Innate level grandmaster overseeing. Even if they do not besiege the Heavenly Martial Army, how can they be besieged instead?";
";Lu Yuan took action.";
";Lu Yuan? Damn, he dares to oppose our Xiao family, he's seeking his own death!"; Xiao Yingcheng's face darkened, fire spewing from his eyes.
";Moreover, the Heavenly Martial Army is very powerful, each of them is like a bloodthirsty madman";
";Even so, they shouldn't be able to encircle and kill!"; Xiao Yingcheng shivered, he took a deep breath, forcefully suppressed his inner rage, and turned to Xiao Yuanhai, ";Uncle, should we lend support?";
";Killing Jiang Ming is priority one,"; Xiao Yuanhai responded. ";If he's not dead, our Xiao family is in danger of total annihilation; if he's dead, everything else won't matter! The third wave of the Black Iron Army's besiegement won't work, inform the Liang family to cooperate. Furthermore";
He paused, his face contorted with rage. ";Let the City Defense Army join the fight!";
";If we resort to that, we risk being exposed.";
";We're at a life or death juncture, there's no room for other considerations. Moreover, to us, Jiang Ming's threat is greater than the Court's. Afterwards, we can offer large sums of money, which should, in most cases, smooth things over!";
";Understood!";
Jiang Ming saw this from the corner of his eyes.
";City Defense Army, Liang family!";
";We can't wait any longer, otherwise it'll be an endless slaughter!";
With this thought, he brandished his hands, spinning them overhead, catching arrows flung at him and hurling them back, shooting the archers on the city wall one after another.
The crossbow bolts fired at him were also caught and flung back, instantly blowing up nine crossbows, but his face grew even paler.
Their rapid breathing was shaky.
";Xiao Yingcheng, prepare to die!"; Jiang Ming leapt up, rushing towards the head of the Xiao family, mid-air, he raised his hands and shot out waves of Sword Qi towards Xiao Yingcheng.
The sound of Sword Qi tearing through the air raised the hairs on people's necks.
";Brazen!"; Xiao Yingcheng could no longer hold it in, he drew his sword and jumped up to meet the Sword Qi head-on.
Under the morning light, the sword glistened, the deadly intent clear.
Clang clang clang
The constant clear sound of the Sword Qi making contact with the long sword echoed.
";Yingcheng, careful!"; Xiao Yuanhai shouted urgently.
He had thought with Xiao Yingcheng's Innate Peak strength, shielding against the Sword Qi wouldn't be a problem, but he suddenly discovered that the Sword Qi contained a power that even made him shudder with fear.
As he issued the warning, he also leapt into the air, but was inevitably too late.
Clang
The long sword couldn't withstand the power of the Six Meridians Divine Sword's Sword Qi, it was immediately shattered, another wave of Sword Qi shot towards the throat, although he dodged, the heart area couldn't evade.
";Tiangang Battle Qi!";
Xiao Yingcheng exerted his ultimate technique, a barrier made of Qi emerged, yet was easily pierced by the Sword Qi, peeling away and reaching his heart.
";What power!"; He looked down, his eyes filled with hatred gradually lost their color, and he fell from mid-air.
";Yingcheng!"; Xiao Yuanhai yelled in despair, he leapt up and summoned a storm with a palm strike, ";Jiang Ming, I will kill you!";
Xiao Yingcheng was killed in an instant.
Jiang Ming engaged in another attack with Xiao Yuanhai.
When he landed, he was staggering, his condition seemed very bad. However, he didn't stop and executed the Meteor Step with Chasing Wind and Moon, leaving a trail of afterimages as he targeted the crowd from the Xiao Family.
There were several Innate-level fighters and quite a few elites from the Xiao family among them.
";Stay right there!"; Xiao Yuanhai was livid with rage, but he couldn't catch up.
Ahh
One after the other, screams rang out. In an instant, Jiang Ming killed more than twenty people, not letting a single one escape.
";Jiang Ming!"; With tears like blood streaming down his face, Xiao Yuanhai roared. ";If I don't kill you, I won't be human. Xiao Yuanrang, Liang Dashan, Liang Dahai, come out!";
The city shuddered with his woeful and furious roars.


CHAPTER-27
27 Chapter 27: Constable Jin's Attack

After a massacre, Jiang Ming stumbled again.
It seemed he really had reached his limit.
But even in this state, Xiao Yuanhai, a Grandmaster, failed to catch up, watching his family disciples being slaughtered helplessly.
The anger and hatred in his heart turned into flames that almost burned his sanity to ashes.
However, he understood one thing: relying only on himself, he might not be able to kill Jiang Ming even if he had reached the end of his strength.
Even if Xiao Yuanrang joined forces with him, the two brothers would be dragged to their deaths.
Since it had come to this, he would fight with all his might.
Either live or die.
";Jiang Ming, I'll skin you alive!"; Xiao Yuanrang appeared on the city wall, his eyes spitting fire, the sword in his hand humming, and the overflowing sword qi constantly cutting the wall.
Powerful and terrifying.
He was another Grandmaster from the Xiao Family who thought this battle was a sure win, so he didn't appear in a hurry and drank silently on the side instead.
But by the time he wanted to take action, it was already too late.
The two of them, one on the left and the other on the right, sandwiched Jiang Ming in the middle.
Their momentum soared, and their killing intent was shocking.
The overwhelming aura swept all the dust and debris around them into the sky, causing the mighty warriors watching the battle to retreat again and again.
Everyone must be careful in a battle between Grandmasters.
";I never thought the four of us would join forces!"; Liang Dashan leaped onto the other side, his white hair contrasting with his spirited and spirited eyes.
He carried a long blade on his back, and the qi emitted from his blade cut through the air, its sharpness enough to split the sky in half.
";A little brat who hasn't even grown a full set of hair has turned Mount Dependence City into a joke."; Liang Dahai also arrived, blocking the last escape route.
He was tall and imposing, not angering himself.
His eyes were filled with deep disgust when he looked at Jiang Ming.
";Jiang Ming, you're a young Grandmaster, ordinary forces can't cultivate someone as strong as you. Tell me, where do you come from?"; Liang Dahai asked sternly.
Condescending and domineering.
";He must be a disciple of the Sun and Moon Demon Sect. Otherwise, how could he help mountain thieves, kill Huijian, and slaughter villages indiscriminately?"; Xiao Yuanhai directly identified him, ";He is an executioner, a big demon head, and a wicked person who must be punished by everyone.";
";Don't label me without reason!"; Jiang Ming revealed a smile, his body paused, his aura abyss-like, showing no sign of weakness.
There was no need to pretend anymore since they had all come out.
From the moment he started, Jiang Ming had made up his mind to uproot both the Xiao and Liang Families, but he lacked an excuse if the Liang Family didn't take action.
So, he pretended to be weak and let Xiao Yuanhai think that he had reached the end of his strength, but still had the power to drag a Grandmaster down to his death. So for safety, he had no choice but to call out the other few people.
Feeling the change in his aura, Xiao Yuanhai and the others couldn't help but change their expressions.
";Mount Dependence City is a first-class city, yet there are three bandit villages nearby. Isn't that a huge joke? Without the support and secret maintenance of your Xiao and Liang Families, how could they have existed until now?"; Jiang Ming's voice thundered, echoing through half of the city, ";I have learned a lot and saw bandits rampant on the mountain, so I decided to eliminate the bandits in the world. So, I led my men along the mountain, killing bandits and thieves wherever we encountered them.";
";When I arrived here and found three bandit villages, I felt something was strange but didn't investigate further and just directly wiped them out. As a result, I found that Xiao Ming, the eldest son of the Xiao Family, was actually colluding with bandits and leading the Three Major Villages to eradicate us.";
";Hehe, in the end, they were killed by us.";
";Eliminating bandit villages was only a temporary stop, and the Xiao Family incited a large number of Jianghu people to besiege us. People are foolish, believing rumors easily, so I had no choice but to fight back.";
";What's more, the Xiao Family even mobilized the Black Iron Army they raised to besiege Baiyun Village and invited powerful Jianghu figures from all over the place to take action.";
";Goodness, they were originally bandits, but they wanted to bite back at us.";
";Standing on the side of justice, yet committing adultery.";
";Am I right?";
Jiang Ming asked with a smile.
";Nonsense!"; Xiao Yuanhai shouted angrily, ";You are a bandit, a thief, a demon, a sinner who committed all kinds of heinous crimes, and a wicked person who must be punished by everyone. Other things aside, just look at these corpses around here, it's the best evidence of you being a big demon head.";
Clap, clap, clap…
Jiang Ming applauded and said with a laugh, ";Well said. In this world where martial might reigns supreme and the powerful is respected, it all depends on who can stand and who will fall. The winner is the king, the loser is the enemy. Justice and truth lie in our fists.";
";Your Xiao Family has proven this point. Because you are powerful, you make the court apprehensive, making them reluctant to send even one Constable from the Six Gates.";
";Look, the City Defense Camp has been deployed, even the crossbows have been brought out, and the so-called Constables from the Six Gates dare not make a sound like dogs.";
";You have the Black Iron Army in your Xiao Family, doesn't the Constable know? He can only hide in his doghouse and pretend not to see.";
";Oh, right, and the three bandit villages, he didn't even try to eradicate them.";
";Hahaha, interesting!";
";The strong is respected, that's it.";
";Come on!";
";Today, either I will fall, or your Xiao and Liang Families will be annihilated!";
Jiang Ming shouted loudly.
He had completely lost hope in the Six Gates.
They had already put the ladder in place, and the Xiao and Liang Families had both jumped out, but Constable Zhang Tong still didn't appear to join forces with him to eliminate the two families.
Did he want to watch us both be injured?
What a wishful thinker!
No matter if he wanted to sit back and watch the fight or if he had been bought by the Xiao and Liang Families, I would make him utterly disgraced.
From a spot on the city wall, Constable Zhang Tong, Constable Jin, and others were all there, watching the battlefield from afar.
Jiang Ming's strength shocked them all.
";Sir, Jiang Ming is too strong, really too strong."; Constable Jin's face turned red with excitement, ";He massacred more than a hundred top Jianghu experts, including several Innate strong people killed by him in one move. Is he going against the heavens?";
Zhang Tong revealed a look of fear.
";Sir, the Xiao Family actually mobilized the City Defense Camp, what a bold move! How dare they? My goodness, they even brought out the crossbows. Are they going to stage a rebellion? Sir, they're going to rebel!"; Constable Jin became even more excited, his sword trembling in his hand.
Humming incessantly.
";Silence!"; Zhang Tong snorted, his eyes shooting a sharp glare.
";Sir, don't you feel excited? This is an unparalleled genius. In the whole world, he's absolutely a peerless demon. There's no comparison. In the future, he will definitely reach the Great Grandmaster Realm, even comparable to Master Zhang."; Constable Jin excitedly remarked, ";My goodness, the head of the Xiao Family was actually killed by him with a flick of his finger. A brilliant kill, an excellent kill, a kill that I wholeheartedly admire!";
Zhang Tong's pupils shrank again, and he looked at his subordinates.
His hand itched to slap her to death.


CHAPTER-28
28 Chapter 28: Astonishing Cut

";Sir, I know you're also excited, should we, should we recruit him to our Six Gates?"; Constable Jin seemed to have not noticed the irritated gaze of the constable, but continued, ";Good fellow, good fellow, look, Xiao Yuanrang has come out, Liang Dashan has appeared, Liang Dahai has jumped out too. I've been saying that. The Xiao and Liang families have been acting for us, but you didn't believe it back then. Now do you believe it? They're one and the same, they're in collusion, they're wearing the same pair of pants.";
";I'm not blind!"; Zhang Tong gritted his teeth angrily.
";Sir, this is a great opportunity, let's move quickly, join forces with Jiang Ming to suppress them. From then on, Mount Dependence City will truly be the court's Mount Dependence City, not the Xiao and Liang families' city. Our Six Gates will definitely gain more face, and we won't be called shrinking turtles by others."; Constable Jin pulled out his long sword, ";Sir, this is a rare opportunity, let's act and suppress them all. The reason is very simple: the Xiao and Liang families are planning a rebellion!";
The other constables looked at him as well.
";Quiet!"; Zhang Tong flashed a cruel light in his eyes, ";One is a bandit, the other is a rebel, both are enemies of the court and of us. Wait for them to both suffer losses and capture them together.";
";Sir, if Jiang Ming loses, do you dare to take down the Xiao and Liang families?"; Constable Jin paused for a moment, and his round face finally showed anger, his voice raised a few degrees, ";Don't forget, the Three Major Villages have always existed and committed evil deeds. But what's the result? We still watch them commit crimes helplessly, making us a joke. Now with such a good opportunity, you turn a blind eye? Zhang Tong, is it true that, as rumors say, you have been bought by the Xiao family?";
";Impudence!"; Zhang Tong was furious, raised his palm containing a storm of destruction, but saw several people behind Constable Jin draw their weapons and confront him.
";Good, very good!"; His face twitched.
";Indeed, very good!"; Constable Jin's face was cold, his usual slightly silly demeanor was gone.
At this time, Jiang Ming's voice also rumbled over.
";Hehe! Like a dog afraid to bark, lying in the doghouse pretending not to see, well said, very good."; Constable Jin sneered, ";Zhang Tong, Constable Zhang, before long, everyone in the world will know that the people of our Six Gates are like dogs.";
Zhang Tong's face flushed red.
The other constables all looked ashamed and angry.
It was clear that they had divided into two factions.
One with Zhang Tong as the head, and one with Constable Jin as the head.
Battlefield!
Clear grudges and misunderstandings, and let some people know the inside story. That's enough.
At least not everyone will put the big hat on his head.
";Win or lose, decide life and death."; Jiang Ming's voice fell, and he made his move directly.
He moved horizontally through the air at an extremely fast speed, leaving behind afterimages as he killed towards Xiao Yuanhai.
Shaoze Sword, Shangyang Sword!
The Six Meridians Divine Sword was used in succession, the whistling Sword Qi and the powerful force it contained, making a defensive Xiao Yuanhai retreat continuously.
His face changed again.
";How can you still have such a terrifying amount of Qi after fighting consecutively?"; Xiao Yuanhai asked doubtfully.
Not only him, but everyone else felt the same.
Even a great Grandmaster would get tired!
";You guess?"; Jiang Ming responded with a sentence, showing no mercy. However, the other three people also closed in, and for a moment, the light of swords and blades enveloped him in the middle.
Unafraid, he expertly evaded and blocked various attacks with a flicker of golden light.
";Kill!";
His blood boiling, he displayed various secret techniques.
Six Meridians Divine Sword, Dragon-subduing Kick, Dragon-subduing Fist, Dragon Claw Hand, Suppressing Air Palm, etc., he used them at will, facing the siege of four grandmasters without losing any ground.
The Sword Qi was rampant, and the palm wind was surging.
The area within a hundred meters was shattered.
The city walls were torn apart, and even many spectators were affected, being dismembered on the spot. Only Bai Yunfei and other close figures could see clearly.
However, they were also shocked by Jiang Ming's strength.
That was four grandmasters!
They leaped into the air, fighting in mid-air before falling to the ground and creating a deep pit. In the morning light, the shadows of the five people were submerged.
The sky roared, and the ground shook.
On the city wall.
Constable Jin had already stepped out, looking at the direction of the battlefield in shock: ";Jiang Ming has actually become so powerful. He is facing four veteran Grandmasters, and they are joining hands. Who can stop him? Even a Great Grandmaster would have to treat him seriously. Not to mention, he had killed more than a hundred powerful fighters and resisted the rain of arrows and Crossbows.";
";Not human!";
";His combat power is probably close to the Great Grandmaster Realm!";
As he said this, she turned to look at Zhang Tong, her eyes containing an ambiguous meaning.
Zhang Tong clenched the blade in his hand.
Some hidden people were also greatly shocked.
In the battlefield.
In case of emergency, Jiang Ming had long formed the Gang Qi of protection around his body, tightly protecting him.
Moreover, the light of the Golden Bell Shield was continuously shining.
At the same time, air of Gang was swirling around his fists and legs, making his attacks incredibly terrifying.
His feet, like a huge axe, almost split Liang Dashan apart. The force of his kick left a hundred-meter-long crack on the ground.
";Big Brother!"; Xiao Yuanhai suddenly shouted.
Xiao Yuanrang immediately understood what was going on. The two of them swiftly closed in, and Sword Qi surged like a cascading waterfall.
Liang Dashan and another person suddenly intensified their attacks.
";In our Xiao family, there is the unparalleled Sword Skill of Unparalleled Sword. With two swords combined, there is nothing to compare, and the lethal Sword cannot be avoided even by ghosts and gods!"; Xiao Yuanhai shouted angrily, ";You have seen this sword, and it is worthy of death!";
In an instant, their two long swords interweaved together, and the endless Sword Qi gathered together to form a point of Sword light on the tip of Xiao Yuanhai's sword.
His long sword seemed to be unable to bear it as it let out a groaning sound as if it were about to shatter.
Xiao Yuanhai suddenly shot out, his speed doubled, reaching an extreme speed and the Sword light aimed at Jiang Ming's brow.
The Sword Qi tore through the void, causing the Golden Bell Shield outside his body to shatter instantly. Even with the protection of the Gang Qi, Jiang Ming could feel a tearing sensation in his brow.
This sword was strong, very strong.
If hit, they wouldn't die but become crippled.
Jiang Ming made his decision in a split second.
At the same time, the Liang brothers completely sealed off the space for him to dodge.
";Kill me? You're not qualified! Since you've brought out the lethal move, this battle should be over."; Jiang Ming roared.
During the previous fight, he had already figured out the four people's moves.
Even occasionally infiltrating into their opponents, although it was quickly expelled, they discovered the trajectory of the operation, memorizing some rough routes which were not difficult to deduce in the future.
The core foundations of the Xiao and Liang families were more or less in his grasp.
At the same time, he also had an estimate of his overall combat power.
Even if he couldn't reach the level of a Great Grandmaster, he certainly wouldn't be far off.
Clang
The long blade on his back was instantly drawn out.
It seemed as if a thunderbolt had struck through the void, splitting the vastness in an instant, landing on the tip of the sword. In an instant, the Blade Qi and the Sword Qi burst, turning into a frightening torrent.
After a brief pause, the Black Saber continued to fall, the long sword shattered, the figure flew backward, blood spilled into the sky.


CHAPTER-29
29 Chapter 29: Lesser Yang and Lesser Yin

Despite having boundless Qi like the sea, an invincible physical body, and profound wisdom, as well as mastering many ultimate martial arts skills, Jiang Ming still felt that he lacked a killing move.
So, he began to attempt deductions.
The first was to comprehend the saber techniques, using Thunderstorm Nine Slashes, Thunderstorm Nine Heavy Slashes, and numerous collected saber techniques as a template. Finally, he understood a saber move: Thunderstorm Flash.
The fierce thunder raged, and the lightning shocked the heavens.
When the saber moved, it was as if the God of Thunder had descended, and the vast Qi transformed into an indestructible saber aura, giving his move an unparalleled sharpness and invincible demeanor.
This move also broke the combined attack of Xiao Yuanhai and Xiao Yuanrang on the spot.
The sword shattered, and the saber tip fell, tearing Xiao Yuanhai's protective Gang Qi, slashing open his chest, and sending him flying out, blood spraying into the sky.
Ahh…
Xiao Yuanhai let out a miserable scream, and without waiting to activate his cultivation, the incredibly sharp saber Qi tore apart his internal organs.
His vitality was gone.
Jiang Ming felt slightly weak, and the Qi within his Dantian surged out, immediately dispelling the feeling of weakness and restoring him to his peak.
With his foundation, he could fight for three days and nights without pausing for breath.
At this moment, silence fell all around.
Xiao Yuanrang was stupefied.
Liang Dashan and his brother also stopped fighting.
It was a lethal kill — an ultimate move.
Two people joined the battle, which was a threat to a Great Grandmaster, and yet it was broken and even countered?
Impossible!
That was their first thought.
Then came boundless terror.
";Dragon-subduing Fist!"; Jiang Ming didn't give them time to be astonished. He immediately attacked, and with a left punch, he sent Xiao Yuanrang flying.
Xiao Yuanrang's chest caved in, and blood gushed out.
He had clearly suffered a severe injury.
";Die!"; Jiang Ming turned and killed towards the Liang brothers.
The saber light cascaded like a waterfall, surging like a tide.
Even if the four of them joined forces, they would have been suppressed. Let alone now when he had unleashed his true power.
In just a short while, Xiao Yuanrang almost died on the spot, Liang Dahai was cut down, Liang Dashan had his arm severed and kneeled on the ground spitting blood.
As he was about to kill Liang Dashan, a voice carried over: ";Stop, stop!";
Immediately afterwards, a middle-aged man quickly arrived and knelt down in front of Liang Dashan before Jiang Ming.
";I am the current head of the Liang Family, Liang Han. I beg for your mercy, Young Master Jiang."; Liang Han bowed deeply, then quickly said, ";The Liang Family is willing to offer 300,000 taels of silver!";
";Interesting!"; Jiang Ming laughed and asked, ";If an enemy isn't completely eliminated, it will come back to life. What would you do if you were in my position?";
Liang Han opened his mouth, revealing a look of bitterness.
";Do you really want to kill everyone?"; Liang Dashan, with great difficulty, uttered, ";Don't involve our wives and children, our families.";
";Haven't the Liang Family destroyed countless homes and lives? Now you talk to me about not involving your families, it's truly laughable!"; Jiang Ming said coldly.
His whole body was filled with an aura as vast as the sea, and the Black Saber unleashed its cutting Qi.
Liang Dashan flashed a ferocious expression, but when he saw Liang Han beside him and the fearful Liang Family members in the distance, he showed a hint of sadness and said to Jiang Ming, ";300,000 taels of silver notes, three Thousand-year Ginseng, the Liang Family's treasured cultivation techniques, and… and";
Seeing Jiang Ming's indifferent gaze and unmoved expression, Liang Dashan finally gritted his teeth and said, ";Shaoyin Scripture.";
";Shaoyin Scripture?"; Jiang Ming's expression changed slightly.
The Nine Yang True Scripture was divided into several parts, as was the Nine Yin Divine Art.
When he had heard from Lu Yuan before, the Shaoyin Scripture was one of them. He didn't expect it to be in the hands of the Liang Family.
";Moreover, you will abolish your cultivation!"; Jiang Ming still said coldly.
";Fine!"; Liang Dashan agreed. ";After the transaction is completed, give me three days. Not only will I abolish my cultivation, but I will also end my own life in Mount Dependence City! However, you must let my Liang Family survive!";
Jiang Ming nodded and saw Liang Han take out a scripture from his arms and pass it over: ";This is the Shaoyin Scripture. As for the other things, I will have someone go and fetch them right away.";
";Interesting!"; Jiang Ming laughed and took it over. It was evident that the Liang Family's master had considered both victory and defeat, pondering how Liang Family could survive and continue if they were defeated in this battle.
A disturbance arose from afar.
That was the rumored ultimate skill Shaoyin Scripture.
No one could have expected that the Liang Family, which had always been suppressed by the Xiao Family, would possess such a powerful skill. Thinking further, the Liang Family, with the Shaoyin Scripture, produced two grandmasters, but they still faced the risk of extermination and couldn't help but sigh.
Feeling a burning gaze, Jiang Ming ignored it and quickly flipped through the pages, memorizing the contents.
In his mind, the flame of wisdom ignited, and in a short while, he comprehended the essence hidden within.
A crescent moon seemed to appear in his eyes.
It was then that the ground shook, and a group of people rushed over from a distance. Leading them were Chang Qing and Lu Yuan, as well as several masked men in black with slim figures.
They were covered in blood.
";Greetings, Commander!"; Chang Qing quickly approached and knelt down on one knee.
";Greetings, Commander!"; Hundreds of people followed suit, kneeling on one knee.
Jiang Ming glanced around and noticed that Heavenly Martial Army's casualties were about one-third, but fortunately, most of the old members were still there.
";You owe me a big favor."; Lu Yuan said, looking at the masked woman next to him and glancing at Jiang Ming without introducing her immediately.
";Thank you!"; Jiang Ming couldn't help but laugh, then said, ";General Chang, take your men to rest!";
";Yes!"; Chang Qing took his men away.
Only then did Jiang Ming walk towards the severely injured Xiao Yuanrang: ";Do you want your family to be wiped out, or do you want to offer the things to save your family?";
Xiao Yuanrang's face was full of hatred, and his eyes were filled with killing intent.
His younger brother was dead.
His son was dead.
His grandson was dead.
Moreover, eighty percent of the family elites were killed, and the Black Iron Army was finished.
What was left for the Xiao Family?
Continuing their lives?
Hehe!
If he himself couldn't survive, the Xiao Family would definitely perish, as they had too many enemies. Even the previously cooperative Liang Family would not let them go and would uproot them completely.
Not to mention the forces within Mount Dependence City, such as Six Gates and many other powers.
He knew very well the circumstances they would face in the future.
";Grandfather!"; A young man staggered over, hugged Xiao Yuanrang's legs, and cried, ";Grandfather, the Xiao Family must not perish! My son, your great-grandson, was just born. Do you want him to die as well?";
Xiao Yuanrang raised his hand, his expression twisted.
The young man suddenly turned pale.
";How can someone like you continue the Xiao Family!"; Xiao Yuanrang said bitterly. He stared at Jiang Ming with a determined look.
However, he eventually sighed. With a deadly gaze, he stared at Jiang Ming and said, ";How can you spare the Xiao Family?";
";500,000 taels of silver notes, five pieces of thousand-year ginseng, the Xiao Family's treasure of martial arts, your life, and "; Jiang Ming said indifferently, ";The Shaoyang Scripture! Don't tell me the Xiao Family doesn't have it. The world is rumoring that the Shaoyang Scripture appeared in Mount Dependence City, but you placed the blame on Baiyun Village. Being the biggest local snake here, it must be in your hands.";
";You're trying to exterminate the Xiao Family completely!"; Xiao Yuanrang's pupils constricted, and his expression twisted again, ";Without mentioning the Shaoyang Scripture, the Xiao Family would still have a slim chance of survival. But now, we have none!";
";Grandfather? Why? We can satisfy all these conditions!"; The young man next to him hurriedly said.
";Fool! Even if we hand over the Shaoyang Scripture, the Xiao Family would still be targeted by the powerful people all over the world. Without a grandmaster to sit and watch over it, and the Innate Realm members almost wiped out, tell me, can the Xiao Family survive? We will be crushed and swallowed, bones and all!"; Xiao Yuanrang continued, shouting, ";Zhang Tong, I know you are watching in secret. Come out!";


CHAPTER-30
30 Chapter 30: Killing Two with a Flick of a Finger

Most of the powerful people watching the battle came for the Shaoyang Scripture, but who would have thought that the Shaoyin Scripture would appear first in Jiang Ming's hands.
Suddenly, countless people were green with envy.
But even though they were itching to seize it, not a single person dared to step forward.
That person is a killing god.
Even the combined efforts of the four Grandmasters resulted in one dead and the others grievously injured, such strength simply drove others to despair.
Today, the Shaoyang Scripture also made an appearance, which made people like Bai Yunfei take heavier breaths.
Many people couldn't help but take a step forward.
";Both Shaoyin and Shaoyang have emerged; something big is bound to happen!"; Lu Yuan on the other side revealed a solemn expression.
";Indeed, something big is going to happen."; A black-clothed woman next to him said lightly, ";Even Lengyue Palace, Chunyang Sect, Sun and Moon Demon Sect, and others will not sit idly by. In the face of the overwhelming tide in the world, they may even join forces to exterminate the Demon Sect. Brother Jiang may be in danger?";
";Exterminate the Demon Sect?"; Lu Yuan paused and couldn't help but shake his head, ";It's absolutely impossible; they still need face!";
";Face?"; The black-clothed woman lightly laughed, ";Firstly, Brother Jiang comes from Baiyun Village, which is a group of bandits; secondly, in this blood-soaked battle here, he has killed more than a hundred martial arts experts, and each of them has a large group of supporters behind them; under their clamor, Brother Jiang would be labeled as an evildoer and an enemy of the Righteous Path; thirdly, no matter what, the Xiao and the Liang families represent the world of martial arts, but he destroyed them, causing those families to naturally nail Brother Jiang onto the pillar of vice; fourthly, the numerous powers in the world of martial arts definitely do not want to see another powerful force emerging, especially a genius that can grow to a level comparable to Elder Zhang; fifthly, the Sun and Moon Demon Sect will fan the flames, claiming Brother Jiang as their cultivated genius, making him the enemy of the Righteous Path; sixthly, it is rumored that the Nine Yin and Nine Yang Scriptures contain hidden secrets to achieve higher levels of martial arts. You tell me, can the world of martial arts not be moved? Can they not take action?";
";This"; Lu Yuan was speechless and anxiously said, ";Doesn't that mean that Brother Jiang will become the center of a huge storm if he gets his hands on the Shaoyang Scripture?";
";Most likely,"; the black-clothed woman's voice became more ethereal, ";Facing the siege of the entire world, he only has one way to survive.";
";You seem to be calculating quite a lot!"; Lu Yuan immediately understood the other party's meaning and laughed lightly, ";Be careful not to lose both the lady and the soldiers.";
On the side, Constable Zhang Tong arrived from afar, and as soon as he appeared, everyone understood that his light skill was unparalleled. He landed lightly beside Xiao Yuanrang and bowed with a solemn expression, ";Brother Yuanrang, what's the matter?";
";Brother Zhang, my Xiao Family has been a loyal minister of the Great Yan Dynasty for generations. We have been diligently guarding Mount Dependence City, and we have contributed a lot to its prosperity!"; Xiao Yuanrang's tone was cold, ";Now, we are facing a great disaster; I beg Constable Zhang to protect my Xiao Family.";
Zhang Tong raised his eyebrows, a hint of killing intent flowed deep in his eyes, and he sighed helplessly, ";How can I intervene in this martial competition between you people?";
";Zhang Tong!"; Xiao Yuanrang's voice suddenly rose eight octaves, revealing an undisguised threat.
The onlookers all revealed curious looks.
If anyone still couldn't see that the Xiao Family had something on Constable Zhang, then they were fools.
Jiang Ming was not in a hurry; he wanted to see how Zhang Tong would jump about and ponder the conversation between Lu Yuan and the black-clothed woman.
He also noticed something: Constable Jin seemed to have secretly saluted the black-clothed woman from afar.
Zhang Tong showed no expression and turned to Jiang Ming, bowing, ";Commander Jiang, too many people have died today, even the City Defense Camp has suffered numerous casualties; if I didn't know better, I would think you were attacking Mount Dependence City! Give me face and let this end today, alright?";
Attacking Mount Dependence City? This was clearly a threat. Are you stronger than the Court?
Then he asked Jiang Ming to give him face, which was obviously giving him a way out.
";Give you face? Who are you? Do I know you? Is your face that big?"; Jiang Ming snorted coldly, ";I've said it before, today's battle, whoever stands on the side of the Xiao Family is my enemy. If you're an enemy, it's either death or total defeat. Do you still want to stand here?";
Zhang Tong's face immediately turned red, and he shouted in anger, ";Jiang Ming, I am a constable of the Six Gates and represent the Six Gates and the Court, while you are nothing but a mountain thief! Do you really think your strength alone can defy the Court? Are you trying to plot a rebellion?";
";You represent the Six Gates and the Court?"; Jiang Ming sneered, ";The dignified constable of the Six Gates sits in Mount Dependence City but ignores those three mountain thieves committing all sorts of atrocities nearby; he turns a blind eye to the Xiao and Liang Families killing and wiping out entire families. Do you still have the face to say that you represent the Court? People who are idle and incompetent and collude with evil, how dare you come out shamelessly? Zhang Tong, where did you get that shameless face?";
";You're looking for death!"; Zhang Tong was furious, his eyes spitting fire.
Although any discerning person would think of what Constable Zhang was doing behind the scenes, it still wasn't exposed on the surface.
As long as it wasn't exposed.
He was a good constable of the Six Gates.
But now it was uncovered.
";Jiang Ming, you are gathering people to plot a rebellion and attack Mount Dependence City; your crime is unforgivable and you must be executed!"; Zhang Tong said, while his thoughts raced quickly in his heart.
Although this one was terribly strong and desperate, there must be a huge consumption after continuous battles.
Even though he looks fine now, it's likely a pretense.
If he kills the opponent, today's matters can be settled. Otherwise, his end would definitely be disastrous.
Constable Jin will surely add fuel to the fire.
Let's gamble on this one!
";Brother Yuanrang, I swear here that if you die in battle, I'll protect the Xiao family, and ensure that its heritage never dies out!"; Constable Zhang roared, ";Kill!";
";Good, kill!"; Xiao Yuanrang knew that this was the best outcome.
If he takes action with Zhang Tong, there will be a glimmer of hope for the Xiao family, otherwise, the Xiao family will surely die without a burial place.
";Seven Sections Break Vessel Skill!"; He kept tapping on himself.
Both hands danced, reaching the extreme speed.
Jiang Ming could see it clearly that every falling finger of his opponent was tapping on the acupuncture points along the meridians, causing the Qi to boil and the aura to surge.
";This is the destruction of the meridians, allowing Qi to be unrestrained and rampant within the body. Although it will cause irreversible consequences, even death, it will explode all the Qi in the body for a short period, forming an extremely strong combat power!";
His eyes flickered and immediately understood the whole situation.
At the same time, he memorized the order of his opponent's moves, fingertip pressure, and so on.
This is a very good Forbidden Law, although the side effects are unbearable.
Hum
Exasperatingly, Xiao Yuanrang's aura formed a whirlwind around his body, instantly boosting his power to its peak.
";Great Chaotic Origin Hand, die!"; His eyes were bloodshot, and he suddenly pounced on Jiang Ming.
Like a human-shaped nuclear bomb, the wind rolled up the clouds wherever he passed.
";Triple Air-splitting Slashes!"; Zhang Tong took action immediately after, apparently letting Xiao Yuanrang take the lead.
Liang Dashan, who was not far away, was itching to make a move.
Powerful people who were secretly spying also started to operate their Qi, ready to make a move.
At this moment, the tense atmosphere once again enveloped the outside of the western gate of Mount Dependence City.
Even Bai Yunfei and Lu Yuan, who were watching the battle, were extremely nervous.
If Jiang Ming were killed or seriously injured, a chaotic battle would surely follow.
";Do you really think I've weakened after these continuous battles?"; Jiang Ming snorted coldly, and the Sea of Qi in his Dantian boiled and surged as rivers of Qi rushed out, increasing his aura again.
At the same time, his eyes suddenly became bright as lamps, reflecting the opponent's killing moves into the Sea of Heart and discerning their weaknesses.
";Die!"; With a thunderous roar, Jiang Ming's sword in his hand struck Xiao Yuanrang, with the deadly move Thunderstorm Flash.
The raging thunderstorm was shocking, and the fierce flashes tore through the air.
";Drop Rain One Sword!"; At the same time, Jiang Ming's left hand drew the long sword from behind him, flicked it in mid-air, transforming it into countless sword shadows that stabbed at Zhang Tong.
The sword shadows divided and resembled dense rain hitting banana leaves, but they also appeared illusory as they suddenly converged to form a single sword tip, penetrating falsehoods, piercing through time and space, and abruptly passing through Zhang Tong's sword shadow into his throat.
Choke
At this moment, Xiao Yuanrang was also chopped and thrown away. In mid-air, he suddenly split into two, scattering blood rain.


CHAPTER-31
31 Chapter Thirty-One: Mysterious Darkness Ninety-Six

Jiang Ming's face was slightly pale, his breath rushed for a moment.
This was the result of his Qi being temporarily drained after simultaneously using two lethal moves. The next moment, his Sea of Qi trembled, a surge of Qi rushed out, once again filling his entire body, reaching its peak state.
At this moment, the surroundings fell silent.
All were filled with shocking expressions.
Xiao Yuanrang had been severely damaged, but just now, he had used a taboo secret skill, temporarily allowing his strength to reach its peak. The strike he unleashed was absolutely terrifying.
Also, there was Zhang Tong, the Constable of the Six Gates, who was capable of being a major power figure in Mount Dependence City. He was definitely a grandmaster-level powerhouse.
Two grandmasters at their peak form joined forces but were killed on the spot.
This was unimaginably hair-raising.
";Even a Great Grandmaster couldn't do this!"; A black-clothed woman next to Lu Yuan whispered, her voice conveying her shock.
";I told you, Brother Jiang is very strong, incredibly strong."; Lu Yuan expelled a sigh, he had wanted to take action just now, but he held back.
He had witnessed the might of Jiang Ming.
Still, the scene just now left him astonished.
";Yes, incredibly strong. His rise can't be stopped!"; the black-clothed woman nodded, ";Next, will he kill everyone in his way?";
";Yes!"; Lu Yuan nodded, although he seemed to feel a bit reluctant.
Jiang Ming silently stood there, scanning his surroundings. Those who felt his gaze could not help but back away.
Finally, he looked at Constable Jin and slightly smiled, ";Are you going to arrest me?";
";No!"; Constable Jin's face still held the color of astonishment, but now her cheeks were flushed with excitement, she stepped forward and bowed, ";We've already found out that Zhang Tong was provided for by the Xiao family, providing protection for the Xiao family's misdeeds. Moreover, he was secretly supporting the mountain bandits and colluding with the Demon Sect. We were just waiting for the opportunity to apprehend him and bring him to Capital City for trial, didn't expect that Brother Jiang would kill him. You did well, this is for the good of the people, eliminating evil and promoting good.";
Jiang Ming's mouth twitched.
This Constable Jin was indeedvery adorable.
He shifted his gaze, glanced at the shock-stricken Liang Dashan and ignored him. Instead, he turned towards the few remaining members of the Xiao Family.
";Commander, leave this to us!"; Chang Qing had already come forward, looking at Jiang Ming with even more admiration, his gaze towards the Xiao Family members filled with a chilling intensity.
";Commander, spare us!"; Before Jiang Ming could speak, a middle-aged man rushed forward at a fast pace. He was an Innate Expert and reached them in just a blink of an eye.
His face was pale, he was panting heavily, when he saw the killed Xiao Yuanhai and dismembered Xiao Yuanrang, he could not help but feel a burst of sorrow, but forcefully held it down, bowed to Jiang Ming and said tremblingly, ";The old saying goes, matters of the martial world should be resolved within the martial world. The disputes and enmities are unclear and misunderstood, today my Xiao Family lost, we are willing to bear all the consequences.";
";I am Xiao Xiong, the third son of Xiao Yuanhai, I only ask Commander Jiang to spare a future for the Xiao Family!";
";I agree to all the conditions you proposed before on behalf of the Xiao Family.";!
";This is the Shaoyang Scripture!";
";The rest of the stuff is being sorted out!";
";In addition, my Xiao Family is willing to give up our ancestral home, but we need some time to move out. Alternatively, the Wangyue Lake in the city is the private property of my Xiao Family, we have a large mansion built on the north side of the lake, and on the island in the middle of the lake, we have another mansion, all of which can be offered to Commander Jiang.";
Xiao Xiong bowed, holding a booklet above his head with both hands.
";You don't want revenge?"; Jiang Ming took the booklet and opened it to read while asking.
Xiao Xiong gave a bitter smile, suppressing his sorrow, ";Those who wander the world of martial arts can't avoid getting hurt, it's just a matter of time. Dynasties change, sects rise and fall, let alone a family. Life and death cycle, the death and life continue, it's the most normal thing. In the future, I just want to carry on the family legacy.";
He bowed deeply again.
Xiao Xiong knew that the Xiao Family was now walking on the edge of extermination, just a slight miscalculation, and they would all be killed, leaving none behind.
Just like when the Xiao Family rose to power, when dealing with their enemies, they always exterminated them completely.
Jiang Ming neither agreed nor disagreed but continued to read the Lesser Yang Scripture, a cultivation skill markedly different from the Lesser Yin Scripture.
The Shaoyin Scripture cultivates Yin-based Qi, whereas the Shaoyang Scripture cultivates Qi that is extremely Yang, almost completely opposite.
";Is it real or false?"; an aged voice asked. Distantly, an Elder in a Gray Robe came walking towards him, and with each step he took, he moved more than ten meters forward, and within moments he reached Jiang Ming.
The elder's hair was entirely white, yet he was energetic, his face as smooth as a baby's.
";It's real!"; Jiang Ming answered without looking up, while continuing to read.
";Rumor has it that the Nine Yang True Scripture and the Nine Yin Divine Art were scattered around the world due to conflicts and eventually divided into nine Yang scriptures: Chuyang, Lesser Yang, Old Yang, Jiaoyang, Lieyang, Haoyang, Supreme Yang, Sun Yang, Chunyang. The Chunyang Sect obtained one Chunyang Scripture and established their gate on the hill. The Zhen Wu Sect obtained the Old Yang Scripture, and thus established their sect,"; the elder slowly started, narrating the past secrets.
He continued: ";The Nine Yin Divine Art is the same, divided into Taiyin, Shaoyin, Absolute Yin, Supreme Yin, Basic Yin, Old Yin, Pure Yin, Initial Yin, Extreme Yin.";
";Lengyue Palace and the Imperial Palace each has one part, the Sun and Moon Demon Sect each has one part of Yin and Yang, and the Dalin Temple has at least two tasks!";
";Surprisingly, I passed by this place and not only watched a fascinating Great War but also got the two secret books of Shaoyin and Shaoyang.";
";Practicing both Yin and Yang may help me break the Heavenly Human barrier, fascinating!";
The elder was delighted and laughed heartily.
";You are having a beautiful dream!"; Jiang Ming had finished reading and remembered everything in his heart. He said to Xiao Xiong, ";Wangyue Lake right? I live there, help me with the furniture. Chang Qing, send someone to follow.";
";Yes!";
";As you wish!";
Xiao Xiong withdrew.
Chang Qing immediately dispatched thirty people to follow.
";I always have beautiful dreams,"; the Elder grinned, ";If you knew who I am, you would know I am right.";
";Who are you?"; Jiang Ming asked curiously.
He felt the elder was very powerful, extremely powerful, far stronger than Zhang Tong and the others, and he emitted a chilling aura.
The spectators also felt puzzled.
However, they all knew that the elder who showed up was not ordinary at all; otherwise, how would he dare to face Jiang Ming, the killing god.
Another exciting show was about to begin.
Many people were anxiously looking forward to it,
Hoping that Jiang Ming would be killed, and then they could snatch the two scriptures.
The Lesser Yin and the Lesser Yang, Yin and Yang together, invincible in the world!
";I know you, you are Xuanming Master, and there is a green mole above your left eye!"; the shocked black-clothed women beside Lu Yuan exclaimed, ";You are still alive.";
";Someone still recognizes me. Surprising, haha, indeed surprising."; Xuanming Master laughed, then his face darkened, ";I am only ninety-six years old, why can't I be alive!";
";I heard that you were hit to death by Master Zhang?"; The black-clothed woman asked again. ";No, you were thrown off the cliff with a palm.";
Xuanming Master's expression suddenly became icy cold, and a chill spread around him.
There were also whispers of shock from not so far away.
";I understand now, back then, one man founded the Xuanming Sect. His Cold Ice Palm defeated all the powerful ones, and he colluded with the Demon Sect and committed all sorts of evil. And he had some disputes with the Zhen Wu Sect, killed one of Master Zhang's disciples."; Tan Xiaotian from the Chunyang sect said loudly, ";Master Zhang angrily came down the mountain and found out it was a plot against him. He was besieged by several strong men, one of whom was Xuanming Master, the ancestor of the Xuanming Sect. Master Zhang slapped him and sent him flying, spewing blood for three thousand feet and falling off the cliff. People assumed that he was sure to die. Later, Master Zhang went to the Demon Sect alone and almost eradicated the Demon Sect. I never thought that Xuanming Master was not dead.";
Feeling an icy gaze, Tang Xiaotian couldn't help but shiver.


CHAPTER-32
32 Chapter 32: Ice, Sun and Moon, God's Fist

The past of Xuanming Master was exposed in a few words.
";Ha ha"; Xuanming Master laughed wildly, creating sonic waves that rolled like tides, causing ripples in the air. The faces of Tang Xiaotian and others turned pale from shock.
";Master Zhang, Elder Zhang, I vow to destroy him when I come down from the mountain this time, and slaughter everyone of the Zhen Wu Sect!"; Xuanming Master did not hide his domineering nature nor his hatred towards Master Zhang.
";Just rely on you?"; Bai Yunfei sneered, ";A dog that has lost his home, should be contending with lives' leftover, dare to jump out. My teacher can kill you once, he can kill you a second time!";
";A teacher? You are Elder Zhang's disciple?"; Xuanming Master was surprised, ";I didn't expect that old man to have such a young disciple. Very well, very well, I will kill you today and collect some interest!";
His face twisted slightly, his hands danced, cold air surged, stirring the wind and clouds, and frost enveloped the surrounding ground.
";Ice Essence, the Great Grandmaster Realm!"; Bai Yunfei's color changed, ";I didn't realize you, Demon Head, had stepped into the Great Grandmaster Realm.";
Great Grandmaster?
As these words came out, the onlookers could not help but change their faces.
The highest achievement in martial arts is the Great Grandmaster Realm. How many of them exist in the world?
Each one dominates in their own area, deterring even the imperial power, with no one daring to provoke.
Jiang Ming silently listened.
From bits and pieces, he understood the past.
As for the Great Grandmaster? He had learned about it a long time ago. It's just the comprehension at the Master-level Realm. In the Main World, it is the Martial Arts Fourth Layer.
In the Main World, the Martial Arts Fourth Layer is also called the Grandmaster level, far beyond the comparison of the Grandmasters here.
Reaching the Martial Arts Fourth Layer means understanding a realm of comprehension, and simultaneously turning Qi into liquid. Only when these two conditions are fulfilled, one can be considered to have reached the Martial Arts Fourth Layer. If only one of them is achieved, it's called the quasi-Martial Arts Fourth Layer.
But in this world, after peaking at the Grandmaster level, once you step into the realm of comprehension, you're considered a Great Grandmaster.
However, he did not know why, but he had never heard of anyone who had turned Qi into a liquid.
";Correct, I am indeed a Great Grandmaster!"; Xuanming Master restrained his domineering attitude and exhaled a sigh of white mist, he held his hands behind his back and tilted his head back, seemingly recalling the past, ";Back in the day, Zhang's disciple,under the banner of chivalry, killed my disciples and grand-disciples, stepping over the corpses of my Xuanming Sect to make a name for himself, I hate him!";
";But Elder Zhang was too strong, what could I do about it?";
";I could only plot secretly.";
";A game of war that was thought to be a sure victory, involving nearly ten Grandmasters, several of whom were powerful individuals close to the Great Grandmaster, was easily broken up by Elder Zhang.";
";And I was knocked down a cliff.";
";In the freezing ice and snow, I lay down for ten full days before I managed to crawl into a cave. I was neither alive nor dead in those years, luckily, I managed to survive.";
";After getting well, I devoted myself to cultivating in solitude, vowing not to come down from the mountain until I reached the Great Grandmaster Realm.";
";Fortunately, heaven did not abandon me. I have mastered the divine skill, comprehended the Ice Essence, and stepped into the realm of the Great Grandmaster.";
";Ha ha, Great Grandmaster, truly strong, so strong!";
";Upon leaving the mountain, I traveled all around, gathering information. Heh, my Xuanming Sect has turned into a past cloud. Standing on the ruins of my former Sect, I remained motionless for three whole days: My Ming, my Yan, all gone, all gone ah!";
";Holding endless grudges, I planned to find old friends from back in the day, attack the Zhen Wu Sect, kill Elder Zhang, and wash Mount Zhenwu in blood. I didn't expect to bump into the emergence of Shaoyang Scripture and Shaoyin Scripture, ha ha, heaven does indeed favor me.";
";With these two scriptures, I will surely become even stronger, and will have a greater chance of wiping out the Zhen Wu Sect.";
Xuanming Master exposed all of his past.
Obviously, he didn't care about the view of the world and vented his hatred at the same time.
Moreover, it declared his intention of revenge.
";Young man, knowing my origin, do you think the old man is having beautiful thoughts? If so, isn't it a matter of course?"; The Xuanming Master looked at Jiang Ming.
But the surrounding people fell silent all together.
It was clear to them that he is a Great Demon Head.
A Great Demon Head at the Great Grandmaster's realm.
But what can be done about it?
Even the distressed Bai Yunfei didn't dare to continue his bluster.
";You are so ugly and yet you have grand thoughts!"; Jiang Ming sneered, ";My spoils of war, you want it? Then, bring out equal cultivation skills. Otherwise, even if God himself came, you cannot take one part from my hand.";
";Little guy, you dare to be so arrogant thinking you could stand up to a Great Grandmaster just because you have killed a few small Grandmasters? The Xuanming Master shook his head and laughed.
";Can a Great Grandmaster be invincible in the world?"; Jiang Ming shook his head, ";I don't believe it.";
";Good spirit of disbelief!"; The Xuanming Master took a step forward, exuding an overwhelming aura. The chill intensified, and the surrounding temperature dropped rapidly, ";I like arrogant youngsters like you the most. Killing you will be a unique pleasure.";
But at this moment, he turned his head and looked in the other direction, saying coldly, ";A familiar presence, not showing up yet?";
With his loud voice bursting out like a cold wave, the spectators in that direction trembled, one by one they retreated, revealing a person.
This person was dressed in a hooded robe, tightly wrapped inside, even his face hidden under the hood.
";Brother Xuanming, I didn't expect you to survive the great catastrophe and reach the realm of a Great Grandmaster. Congratulations, really, congratulations!"; The person lifted the hood, revealing an elder with white hair, who greeted and laughed at Xuanming Master as he walked by.
";So it's you, Situ Ming."; The Xuanming Master immediately recognized the other party and said, ";I didn't expect you to be alive.";
";When Elder Zhang ascended the mountain that year, it just so happened that I was out and escaped the disaster. But when I returned to the mountain, everything was in ruin, even the stones were bleeding!"; Situ Ming sighed and said in a hateful tone, ";For so many years, I was trying to devise ways to kill him, but unfortunately, he was too powerful. So powerful that I lost the thought of revenge and could only hope for him to die of old age.";
";If he dies of old age, you will die of suffocation."; The Xuanming Master snorted and turned to the other side, ";Aren't you going to show yourself?";
";The Divine Fist Sect's Chong Erliang!"; A middle-aged man walked out from among the crowd. There were several people following behind him, one by one their bodies were huge, veins popping out, containing explosive power.
Chong Erliang cupped his hands and said: ";I didn't expect the Xuanming Master to reappear in the world.";
";Divine Fist Sect, what's your relationship to Chong Wanjin?"; The Xuanming Master asked.
";His father!"; Situ Ming said.";
";Chong Wanjin is dead? Haha, it clears up a big concern for me."; The Xuanming Master laughed wildly, but then he said in a weird way, ";His name was Chong Wanjin, but he named his son Erliang, how interesting, truly interesting.";
Chong Erliang showed anger on his face.
However, the Xuanming Master didn't care, he scanned the people again, and snorted: ";There are a few shrimp soldiers and crab generals, who are not qualified to come in front of the old, forget about it!";
In the end, he looked at Situ Ming again and said indifferently, ";You must have come for the scripture. Since you are here and also ran into me, you cannot be indifferent. Jiang Ming or Chong Erliang, choose one to kill.";
";I knew the minute you called my name that there was no good hiding."; Situ Ming said helplessly, ";Jiang Ming, the extraordinary young talent, I am not sure; Chong Erliang, the master of the Divine Fist Sect, specializes in the Way of Body, I am even less confident. Brother Xuanming, aren't you sending me to my death?";
Xuanming Master just looked at him indifferently.
";I choose Chong Erliang!"; Situ Ming gave a wry smile, he knew that today he must take action.
This is an attitude, and also a stance.


CHAPTER-33
33 Chapter Thirty-Three: Bloody Battle with the Great Grandmaster

Xuanming Master appeared, completely becoming the focal point.
A great grandmaster, truly standing at the peak of the martial arts. Who could see him on ordinary days? Today, however, he appears right in front of everyone, but it's a pity that he is a big demon head.
He even threatened to wash Zhen Wu Sect in blood.
Who wouldn't be afraid!
Even Lu Yuan's expression was solemn, and his face didn't look good.
Jiang Ming just stood quietly, also sensing the change in the opponent's aura, analyzing what the so-called Ice Essence really was about.
With his powerful spirit and hundredfold comprehension, he had some vague insights.
";Heaven and Earth Dao Resonance? It's more than that!";
Jiang Ming pondered in silence.
To be able to provoke the cold qi, it has already transcended ordinary cultivation techniques and defies logic.
";If I engage in a battle and experience it firsthand, I'll be able to see the essence of the realm!";
Jiang Ming eager to try but not in a hurry.
This guy jumped out, he would never stop.
As for Situ Ming and Chong Erliang's appearance, he was not surprised, because he had already sensed them. After they reported their identity, it suddenly dawned on him.
Back in Black Wind Village, he killed the demonic sect elder Tan Feng and the vice sect leader of the Divine Fist Sect, Quan Wuer, and got the message: to besiege Chong Erliang using Shaoyang Scripture as a lead-in.
It was obvious that the Xiao Family was either connected with the Sun and Moon Devil Sect or collaborated with Quan Wuer.
Quan Wuer, Tan Feng, Situ Ming, even if Xiao Family wasn't counted, there was still an eighty to ninety percent certainty of besieging Chong Erliang.
";Am I considered his life-saving benefactor?"; Jiang Ming looked at Chong Erliang with a strange thought in his heart.
He became even more certain that there was more than one person from the Demon Sect present.
";There is another terrifying existence that even Xuanming Master hasn't sensed, interesting!"; Jiang Ming was not afraid in the slightest.
He had gained a lot from this great battle, and although he wanted to settle down and ponder, seeing the Great Grandmaster made him excited.
Realm, realm, only by truly experiencing it and having a primer could he be confident in comprehending one in a short period.
Chong Erliang couldn't help but say, ";Am I being forced to participate in the battle?";
";Meeting is fate, fate arises and ceases, fate is born and dies, all are fate."; Situ Ming had already walked over, ";I'm just passing by, but since we've met, I'll witness life and death. Anyway, there's a lot of grudges between our two sects. If you die here, one day, I'll personally go to the Divine Fist Sect to deliver your disciples so they can accompany you underground.";
";Old man, you really think you've got me figured out."; Chong Erliang sneered, straightened his body, shaking off his large cloak, and strode towards the other party, ";All you people of the Demon Sect, regardless of whether you are demon brats or old demon heads, you all deserve to die.";
";Kill Fist, die!";
Jumping into the mid-air, Chong Erliang threw a punch that created a storm-like sound, as if piercing through the void and hitting the opponent's head directly.
This was an extremely pure power, far stronger than Quan Wuer's.
Situ Ming sneered, flipping his palms, and actively countered.
The two began to battle each other.
On the other side.
";You really won't give it to me?"; Xuanming Master showed a dangerous glint.
";I'd like to try the methods of a great grandmaster to see if he can really kill me!"; Jiang Ming casually threw it, along with the Shaoyin Scripture, towards Lu Yuan, ";Brother Lu, hold onto this for me first!";
On that side, except for Lu Yuan, there were also Chang Qing and members of the Heavenly Martial Army, as well as several black-clothed women.
The black-clothed people were all in the Innate Realm, and among them was a grandmaster whose strength was not much weaker than Lu Yuan's.
Together, even in the face of Xuanming Master, they could resist for a while.
";Brother Jiang, you're harming me!"; Lu Yuan cried bitterly, ";This thing is a hot potato; if I'm not careful, my head will be taken off.";
";If it's really taken off, I'll avenge you!"; Jiang Ming replied, releasing his overwhelming aura without concealing it.
It was even more powerful than before.
Facing the Great Grandmaster, he had to fight with all his strength.
Otherwise, if killed, there would not even be a chance to regret.
At the same time, he also drew his long sword once again, as for the Black Saber? He chose not to use it.
";A newborn calf isn't afraid of a tiger. What courage!"; The Xuanming Master didn't bother to say anything more. He raised his hand, a palm strike carrying a turbulent force, accompanied by a thick chill. At the same time, he yelled, ";I'll show you the power of a Great Grandmaster, Cold Ice Divine Palm! Die!";
Even with the protection of Gang Qi, Jiang Ming felt the deep chill.
";The quality of the Qi surpasses and even carries a frosty sensation, just like the power of Heaven and Earth."; Jiang Ming's eyes sparkled, as he perceived the variations of this palm and analyzed the nature of the Qi.
He twisted his wrist, creating countless sword shadows. Wisps of Sword Qi shot out, like a dense spring shower, endless and innumerable.
It was indeed the Gentle Rain Sword Technique.
It was the ultimate softness, prioritizing defense above all else.
However, this sword technique couldn't block the opponent's palm strike. Jiang Ming quickly moved back while displaying the technique to its limits, using the dense Sword Qi to dissolve the opponent's attack.
";Interesting."; The Xuanming Master advanced, shattering the countless Sword Qi with a single palm strike. From above, it was like a huge millstone, gathering the extreme chill, as if intending to freeze everything.
The surrounding void was frozen, frost was everywhere, making this area appear as if it had entered the coldest winter months.
The extreme oppressive feeling made Jiang Ming startled; at the same time, he felt a force coming from the Heaven and Earth.
This was realm suppression.
";Sudden Rain Eighteen Swords!"; Jiang Ming's sword technique changed, and the speed at which he drew his sword suddenly increased several times.
This was the advanced technique of the Thirty-Six Sword Skills of Light Rain.
It focused on speed and urgency.
Hum hum
The void hummed, and the sword's singing was unceasing, forcibly tearing through the opponent's palm force, breaking this strike. However, Jiang Ming could also feel the chill penetrating his body. Despite his powerful physique and profound Qi, he still shuddered slightly.
With the rotation of his Qi, his blood stirred, and it was promptly purged.
";No wonder he's at the Great Grandmaster Realm; he's so powerful!"; Jiang Ming was amazed.
He initially thought that the Great Grandmaster in this area, even if strong, would still be only within the range of a Grandmaster and belonged to the Martial Arts Realm of the Third Layer of Gang Qi.
But he was wrong.
";The great power of this Great Grandmaster lies in the power of the realm of comprehension. The power of Heaven and Earth lends a dao resonance, imbued with attributes in the Qi. Every move seems to have the suppression of Heavenly Might, making him this powerful!";
As Jiang Ming analyzed, the long sword swirled, creating countless sword shadows that also made Xuanming Master feel somewhat troublesome.
";Storming Nine Swords!";
His sword technique changed again, suddenly producing sword after sword like a fierce storm, as if thousands of thunderbolts were striking down. The berserk swordplay forced the Xuanming Master to take a step back.
";This entire sword technique is ingenious and profound, with each level progressing higher!"; The Xuanming Master naturally knew that the Thirty-Six Sword Skills of Light Rain, Sudden Rain Eighteen Swords, and the current Storming Nine Swords were all an advanced set of sword techniques and extraordinarily powerful.
";But ultimately, that's all it is!"; The Xuanming Master continued, ";Without the support of a realm, even the most powerful sword technique is limited. Xuanming Divine Finger, Piercing through the Vast and Boundless!";
His figure suddenly vanished, having already penetrated the dense sword network, pointing towards Jiang Ming's brow.
The sharp and icy radiance, the penetrating power, caused Jiang Ming's brow to ache slightly and made it difficult for him to react quickly.
Hum
Golden light flickered, forming a total of nine layers, the Golden Light Shield blocked in front of him. However, the Xuanming Master's finger broke through all nine layers.
Just like they were made of paper, but it managed to hold out for a fraction of an instant.
";Crazy Rain Three Swords!";
Jiang Ming remained incredibly calm, his sword technique changed once again, appearing like the nine heavenly Milky Way bearing countless thunder and lightning crashing down. With the emergence of the three swords, the raging torrent forced the Xuanming Master to retreat.
";Drop Rain One Sword!";
Finally combining the three swords into one, it formed the forbidden attack of this sword technique. Like a meteor across the sky, thunder and lightning concentrated, becoming simple and unadorned. The cold radiance condensed at the tip of the sword, causing Xuanming Master to feel an eerie sensation, making him explosively retreat.


CHAPTER-34
34 Chapter 34: Grasping the Realm of Comprehension

Drop Rain One Sword, this ultimate move had instantly killed Constable Zhang Tong, but it did not cause any harm to Xuanming Master.
Even in gradual succession, the power of this sword had reached its peak.
";As expected from a Great Grandmaster!"; Jiang Ming sighed but did not pursue. Instead, he stopped and focused most of his attention on analyzing the Ice Intent.
He seemed to have already touched upon the threshold.
";Such a genius is rare in this world indeed."; Xuanming Master finally showed some concern, ";This old man appreciates talent and doesn't want to kill you. How about you submit to this old man? I will show you the charm of the Martial Arts Pinnacle.";
";You think the realm of a Great Grandmaster can stop me?"; Jiang Ming scoffed, ";And you want to subdue me, where does your confidence come from?";
";Geniuses are all proud, and they all have a stubborn backbone. But once the backbone bends or breaks, it becomes rotten. So be it, such a character like you, if I don't kill, I can't sleep in peace."; Xuanming Master stepped forward again, his momentum rising even higher.
A bone-chilling cold gushed all over his body, and a fog shrouded his head.
He was even more powerful than before.
This scene astonished the surrounding spectators.
";Such a strong Great Grandmaster and such a powerful Jiang Ming!"; The black-clothed woman exclaimed, ";Brother Lu, what is his background?";
";I don't know!"; Lu Yuan shook his head.
He couldn't just say that he had come from a small mountain village. How could someone from a small mountain village grow to such a level? That would be nonsense.
In fact, he was also curious about Jiang Ming's true background: ";Anyway, after today, Jiang Ming will have a place in this world.";
";It's not just a place in the world, but I'm afraid"; The black-clothed woman paused and narrowed her eyes, ";If he can't resist, shall we join forces?";
";You?"; Lu Yuan looked surprised, ";That's a Great Grandmaster! Dare you?";
";The value of Brother Jiang is not comparable to that of a Great Grandmaster. Besides, Xuanming Master is an old wretch with a vicious nature, can't imagine what crazy things he would do now that he is in the world again. If there's a chance, naturally, we should eliminate him first.";
";It's really like you. It's just a pity if you were a man, maybe";
Lu Yuan didn't finish his sentence.
The black-clothed woman didn't respond either.
However, they had both secretly mobilized their Qi, ready to take action at any time.
Jiang Ming was already battling Xuanming Master once again.
Unable to withstand the clash of power, the long sword shattered, and he immediately abandoned it.
He unleashed the Dragon-subduing Fist, domineering and powerful, but it was of no avail against his opponent.
";Illusion Palm!";
Suddenly, as Xuanming Master launched his palm, cold winds howled and the mist enveloped, making his palm shadows appear both real and illusory, indistinguishable.
";Using the cold to create fog, the fog becomes an illusion, and the palm technique merges into the fog, making it difficult to distinguish between real and fake."; Jiang Ming instantly understood the essence of his opponent's palm technique.
Seeing through it didn't necessarily mean he could defend.
Xuanming Master seemed to have turned into a ghostly figure, weaving through the dense fog, and although it didn't affect Jiang Ming much, his opponent was too fast.
It was as if he had become a part of the cold fog.
Boom, boom, boom
Jiang Ming was passively defending, and while enduring his opponent's bombardment, the cold invaded his body, making his movements slightly stiff. Fortunately, his blood Qi was as vigorous as the ocean, and his Qi was as profound as the abyss. Although he was being suppressed, he could still withstand it.
The spectators couldn't help but tremble.
The pervasive coldness, like heavenly might, and the power that burst forth made them all fearful.
Especially Bai Yunfei, who was even more frightened.
If his opponent were to really retaliate against Zhen Wu Sect, who could resist besides his master?
He waved towards the distance, and immediately someone rushed over. He quickly ordered, ";Send the message back that Xuanming Master wants to take revenge on the sect, and he has reached the Great Grandmaster Realm.";
";Yes!"; The young man responded and retreated.
";Not only is it a disaster for your Zhen Wu Sect, but it's also a disaster for the Tianxia Sects. If a Great Grandmaster kills indiscriminately regardless of his status"; Tang Xiaotian couldn't help but grin as he spoke.
He Qianshan and the others all furrowed their brows deeply.
On the other side.
The battle between Chong Erliang and Situ Ming was also extremely intense. The two seemed to have intentionally avoided this area, and the place where they were fighting had unknowingly moved to a nearby forest.
Great trees were destroyed, and dust filled the sky.
Here.
Jiang Ming dealt with Xuanming Master's attack at close range.
";Why does his Qi seem endless?"; He didn't understand.
He had fought several battles in a row and faced himself, so he must have gone all out, but his power didn't seem to be depleted at all. It was completely against common sense and unimaginable.
He also realized that it might be impossible to take down his opponent with his current means.
He changed his body art and turned his palm into a finger.
";Illusion Yin Finger!";
";Jueyin Finger!";
";Destroying Yin Finger!";
";Severing Yin Finger!";
Each finger was extremely terrifying, aimed directly at Jiang Ming's heart, throat, temples, and other vital points. Combined with unparalleled body art, it was as if he had turned into several people.
Jiang Ming frowned, and a golden light suddenly appeared, forming nine layers around him.
Not stopping there, before the golden light of the Ninth Layer of the Golden Bell Shield could circulate, it merged into one and barely managed to block Xuanming Master's first three fingers.
Taking advantage of this opportunity, Jiang Ming punched him and sent him flying back.
";The nine layers of Golden Bell Shield merge into one, you have cultivated to unprecedented heights, you demon!"; Xuanming Master was truly shocked, ";And your fists, I broke through your protective Gang Qi, but your skin is so hard, and your bones are so strong, comparable to Chong Wanjin back then. At such a young age, how did you cultivate?";
He felt an inexplicable sense of horror in his heart.
";Die!"; He leaped into the air, pressed his palm down, and released a torrent of cold air. The surrounding fog also gathered, transforming into a giant palm movement.
This was his ultimate move, Xuanming Giant Hand Seal, pushing his power to the extreme.
Jiang Ming glanced at the white mark on his fist and his pupils shrank. He stepped on the ground and soared into the sky, with circles of Gang Qi wrapped around his fist.
";Dragon Soaring from the Abyss, Fighting for the Nine Heavens!";
This was a killing move from the Dragon-subduing Fist, condensing his spirit, will, and Qi into an unparalleled strike.
The wind and clouds surged, and the sound of his fist whistled.
Jiang Ming shattered the huge palm with one punch, but he was also knocked down to the ground, crashing into a deep pit. The splattered mud was like arrows, piercing several spectators in the distance.
The power released from the collision made Bai Yunfei and the others pale in shock and retreat once again.
";Is this the power of a Great Grandmaster? Terrifying, too terrifying.";
";Isn't it Jiang Ming who should be terrifying? He's only at the Master-level Realm, yet he can contend with a Great Grandmaster, one who has lived for nearly a hundred years.";
That sentence shocked the people around them once again.
They looked at Jiang Ming in the deep pit with inexplicable anticipation.
";I can't believe I didn't kill you!"; Xuanming Master hadn't even landed when he saw Jiang Ming standing up, flipping his palm and pressing it down again, ";Die!";
";Want to kill me? You have no chance now, no, you never had any chance from the start."; Jiang Ming looked up at the falling Xuanming Master and the palm print emitting the ultimate chill, revealing a smile, ";I also have to thank you. If it weren't for you, it would have taken me another two or three months to take this step.";
His body began to emanate a peculiar aura.
It grew thicker and thicker, like dark clouds sweeping over and heavy rain pouring down from the sky.
At the same time, a system notification sounded in Jiang Ming's mind.


CHAPTER-35
35 Chapter 35: The Third Talent

";Ding: It has been detected that the host has achieved the ability to solidify their cultivation level in a special environment, officially stepping into the Martial Arts Realm of the Third Layer of Gang Qi, temporarily solidifying the Reincarnation of Nirvana' talent.";
";Ding: Host, please comprehend ten kinds of realms within the Martial Arts Realm of the Third Layer of Gang Qi; otherwise, the talent Nirvana Rebirth' will disappear.";
Jiang Ming suddenly felt an immense life force surge into his body, filling every cell, especially a strange force imprinting onto his blood vessels and engraving into his soul.
But at this moment, he could not pay attention to the system's content.
Facing Xuanming Master's attack, Jiang Ming gave off a strange wave of power, like clouds, mists, or water, which seemed to make heavy rain fall centered around him.
This was the Rain Intent.
He had comprehended it.
He had also entered the Master-level Realm of this world, and the Dao resonance bathed his body, refining his Qi and even allowing his spirit to undergo a metamorphosis, uplifting and purifying his entire being.
His combat power skyrocketed in an instant.
Without taking the time to delve deeper into his comprehension, Jiang Ming stretched out his hand, forming a long sword with his Qi, and thrust it straight upward.
It seemed as if thousands of raindrops fell into the void, suddenly merging with the tip of the sword.
This was the Drop Rain One Sword, bolstered by the power of Rain Intent.
It made the power of this sword much more terrifying than before.
";Impossible!"; Xuanming Master exclaimed.
In the snap of a finger, he could feel the earth-shaking changes within Jiang Ming's body and could also sense the heavy rain falling around him.
But there was no rain.
He understood that this was the illusion created by the comprehension of the Rain Intent, but the change in the opponent's body was too fast and too terrifying. The burst of strange power in that instant was much stronger than when he had broken through.
Xuanming Master found it incredible and inconceivable.
It was already defying common knowledge for a young person like Jiang Ming to fight him, but to break through during the battle?
That's bullshit!
";What kind of demon are you?"; Xuanming Master hadn't even realized that his voice was trembling, and the power within him surged out madly, making this attack surpass its peak.
It all happened in a flash.
In a split second, Jiang Ming's sword pierced through the large handprint, and the sharp power on the sword's tip made Xuanming Master shiver. He quickly dodged the attack by turning away.
The long sword in Jiang Ming's hand shattered, dissipating into specks of Qi light in the air.
He clenched his palm and another long sword appeared, stabbing out again. This time, it gave off a feeling of torrential rain pouring down.
It was at its extreme speed.
Once again, it was the Drop Rain One Sword.
Whoosh
Xuanming Master couldn't dodge in time, and his shoulder was pierced, retreating to a distance.
Jiang Ming didn't chase him but carefully pondered the changes in his own body.
Finally, he understood why comprehending realms made everyone so powerful. Comprehending a realm meant gaining the Dao Resonance power of Heaven and Earth, refining one's body, and ascending. Even the soul and will could undergo a certain degree of transformation.
When invoked, it was equivalent to being blessed with the power of Heaven and Earth, making the power increase many times over.
This was just a preliminary comprehension.
";This old bastard's understanding of the Ice Intent is not deep.";
Looking at Xuanming Master, Jiang Ming gained some enlightenments.
Moreover, comprehending the realm allowed him to achieve one of the goals for coming to this world. Not only could he leave at any time, but he could also keep all the gains from this world except the physical objects.
With the pressure gone and a sudden sense of relief in his heart.
";Being able to retain my cultivation and the talent of the Third Layer of Martial Arts relies on the Main World as a support? That's interesting.";
Nirvana Rebirth: Extremely powerful vitality, possessing a trace of the supreme life rule imprint, granting the host unparalleled recovery, limb regeneration, rebirth with a single drop of blood, and even immortality through Nirvana Rebirth. The talent's abilities strengthen as the host's power increases.
The talent Jiang Ming had acquired also made him extremely delighted.
Although it didn't seem to directly enhance his combat power, it greatly improved his survivability. At the very least, he wouldn't die easily.
As for the ten realms he needed to comprehend in order to solidify the talent, he didn't care much.
Compared to everything else, it was a relatively simple task.
The face of the Xuanming Master on the opposite side changed unpredictably.
The wound on his shoulder had stopped bleeding, and he looked at Jiang Ming not pursuing him. He hesitated in his heart: should he fight or flee?
If he didn't kill the enemy today, there was a high probability that he would be killed by Jiang Ming in the future.
This youngster was too much of a demon.
It made his heart tremble.
";Is he understanding the changes of true meaning?";
The Xuanming Master narrowed his eyes, clenched his teeth in his heart, tore open the wound on his shoulder, and blood immediately spurted out. He guided the blood before him, and waves of cold power poured into it, turning it into a blood-colored spear that was thrown at Jiang Ming.
This was the Forbidden Ice Blood Spear he had comprehended.
As the blood spear swept through, Heaven and Earth trembled.
It seemed that the energy of Heaven and Earth was even blessing it, making the spear tear apart the void and pierce through everything, annihilating everything. The Xuanming Master followed close behind.
Jiang Ming's blurry eyes focused, and his big hand grabbed the spear, turning Qi into a sword and stabbing it out. It was still Drop Rain One Sword, easily shattering the opponent's Ice Blood Spear.
";Impossible!"; The approaching Xuanming Master's pupils shrank and he exclaimed in horror.
";Nothing is impossible!"; Jiang Ming's long sword in his hand also shattered, but it reappeared again, using the Thirty-Six Sword Skills of Light Rain this time.
With the Rain Intent blessing him, the power of his sword technique rose by several levels.
";I don't believe it! I, the great Xuanming Master, can't even deal with a brat like you!"; The Xuanming Master went mad.
His hands fluttered, and cold Qi surged, the fog blurring his surroundings.
However, he still couldn't break through Jiang Ming's Sword Array.
Thirty-Six Sword Skills of Light Rain, Sudden Rain Eighteen Swords, Storming Nine Swords, and Crazy Rain Three Swords were displayed one by one, grinding down his opponent.
His comprehension of the Rain Intent grew deeper and more profound.
Even with every sword he struck, its power would increase by a fraction.
";How can you be such a demon? Understanding true meaning in battle, your true meaning keeps getting stronger even during battle. Even Elder Zhang isn't this demonic. No, he's far from it."; The Xuanming Master went mad, his hair disheveled, and his body covered in blood, ";Are you a human or a demon?";
";I am an Immortal, a banished Immortal from Heaven!"; Jiang Ming replied with a smile, feeling more and more relaxed, ";Intent, or True Meaning, once you break through the threshold, it becomes extremely simple.";
";Simple?"; The Xuanming Master's voice rose by seventy-two degrees, ";It took me more than twenty years to understand it when I reached the peak of Grandmaster level, and then I was thrown off a cliff, falling into the ice and snow, struggling to survive at the border between life and death before I barely understood it. And you're saying it's simple!";
";Of course simple!"; Jiang Ming laughed, ";Look, isn't this another kind of true meaning?";
His breath changed, and the surrounding Dao Resonance transformed, like a pouring rain environment, wisps of fog suddenly appeared, making his sword momentum unpredictable.
";This is the Fog Intent!";
The sword momentum turned again, and the cold air surged, turning the condensed fog into ice particles, which were no weaker than the cold air emitted by the Xuanming Master.
";This is Ice Essence!";
Jiang Ming's momentum kept changing.
Rain is the liquid state, fog is the gaseous state, and ice is the solid state; they are the three different states of water. For Jiang Ming, who had already entered the realm of comprehension, understanding and reasoning these were too easy.
But the Xuanming Master looked as if he had seen a ghost, his eyes bloodshot.
";Impossible, absolutely impossible, that's true meaning! How did you comprehend three kinds in a moment? Jiang Ming, are you a human or a ghost?"; The Xuanming Master even felt a spine-chilling sensation.
";That's nothing!"; Jiang Ming was unhurried, and as he performed his sword techniques, he first activated the Ice Intent and spread cold air, condensing water vapor into fog.
With the blessing of the Fog Intent, a thick fog enveloped the surroundings in an instant.
The power of the realm was supposed to be intangible, but the Ice Intent was extremely special; its invisible influence materialized, forming fog.
The next moment, Jiang Ming activated the Rain Intent.
The fog condensed and formed raindrops that fell.
This was real rain.
Jiang Ming immersed his mind in Heaven and Earth, comprehending the beauty of Dao Resonance and the Dao of Nature. He also condensed Qi into weapons and started performing sword techniques that had already surpassed the category of Light Rain Swords. He could easily alternate between the three intents.
When the falling rain met the extreme cold intent, it turned into Ice Rain.
An unusual force field formed within this area, trapping the Xuanming Master tightly, making it difficult for him to break free.
Jiang Ming's sword technique continued to evolve and transform, and even the three Intents changed, merging with each other. Vaguely, they gained the momentum of a surging river.


CHAPTER-36
36 Chapter 36: Great River Sword Intent, Planning the World

Xuanming Master's face turned extremely ugly.
He discovered a terrible thing  he was completely suppressed by his opponent and confined within this area.
Jiang Ming's comprehension of true meaning was even more terrifying and powerful, giving him a sense of oppression. What was even harder for him to accept was that his opponent had successively comprehended three kinds of true meaning.
So be it, if he comprehended them.
Damn it, he could even freely switch between the three kinds of true meanings, forming a perfect cycle: frost turns into mist, mist condenses into rain, rain becomes ice, and ice creates mist again.
He was trapped in this small cycle, unable to break free.
Xuanming Master also discovered that these three true meanings were rapidly integrating and transforming; it seemed like small streams were winding and large rivers were surging.
";The power of water?";
He let out an exclaimed.
";That's right, the power of water."; Jiang Ming nodded. ";Whether it's ice, mist, or rainfall, they all belong to different states of water's evolution. Now, I'm going against the flow, integrating the three true meanings in reverse, thus forming the power of water. Xuanming Master, coincidentally, I also deduced a sword technique from it, so please appraise it.";
";A stream plunges down three thousand feet, like the Silver River falling from the Ninth Sky!";
";With the power of water transforming into a river, incorporating it into the sword technique, I call it the Great River Sword Intent!";
As Jiang Ming's voice fell, his long sword drew an arc in mid-air. The power of ice, mist, and rain all converged together, forming a stream. However, it gave people a feeling of surging and vast torrent.
Descending from the sky, it was indeed like a silver river crashing down, unstoppable.
The condensed supreme power made Xuanming Master's body sank, giving him the feeling of being unable to catch his breath.
";My Ice Essence is actually being suppressed. How could this be? Between true meanings, there shouldn't be a distinction between superior and inferior, only different levels, right?"; His face turned extremely ugly, showing a look of horror.
Under the influence of this Dao Resonance, he could hardly maintain the power of his Ice Essence.
";Xuanming Absorption, Boundless Calamity Finger!"; Xuanming Master knew that danger was imminent, so he activated his ultimate move that he had comprehended. His body seemingly turned into a black hole, absorbing and condensing endless power and focusing it into a sharp point at his fingertip.
Boom
There was a massive explosion in the sky, shaking heaven and earth.
";I am finished!"; In the instant they collided, Xuanming Master completely despaired as his Ice Essence was shattered by the opponent's power.
The power of the opponent was even beyond his imagination.
In a trance, he seemed to see the old Elder Zhang from the past.
The long sword fell, and Xuanming Master's fingers were crushed, his arm exploded, and then his body was split in two.
The dignified Great Grandmaster and former sect leader were killed on the spot.
Jiang Ming just glanced indifferently and then looked towards the other side of the battle. Perhaps sensing Xuanming Master's death, Situ Ming quickly retreated after pushing Chong Erliang away.
Another powerhouse concealed in the dark also left quietly as the focus shifted.
He didn't pursue and instead closed his eyes, integrating his heart with heaven and earth, and experiencing the changes in the realm of comprehension.
As he comprehended the realm of water, his own body  from flesh and blood, bones, internal organs, to the soul and will, all underwent the baptism of the heavenly powers.
His True Qi quality also increased.
Even his comprehension was improving, and his spirit became more refined.
His vitality was vigorous, full of energy, and even his resilience improved greatly.
These were the enormous benefits brought by the realm of comprehension.
";The way of the realm is vast and profound, and I've only just entered the door.";
The more he comprehended, the more he felt the vastness of heaven and earth and the breadth of nature.
All those who had been watching the battle were dumbfounded.
At first, no one had high hopes for Jiang Ming. After all, he had fought several battles in a row and must have consumed a lot of energy. Moreover, his opponent was a Great Grandmaster, a veteran among the strong, who had once competed with Elder Zhang.
But what was the result?
Jiang Ming not only held his own but also comprehended the power of true meaning, stepping into the realm of the Great Grandmaster.
";Unbelievable!"; Bai Yunfei's mouth and tongue went dry, but his eyes burned with excitement. ";Did he really kill Xuanming Master? Brother He, Brother Tang, am I dreaming?";
";Not only are you dreaming, but I am also dreaming."; Tang Xiaotian said blankly.
";We're all dreaming together, dreaming the same dream."; He Qianshan murmured and then shuddered. ";The world's situation will change. The youngest Great Grandmaster, the most terrifying of the Great Grandmasters, the invincible Great Grandmaster?";
";Although he's monstrously gifted beyond all reason, as long as our old man is still around, he can't be called invincible in this world."; Bai Yunfei curled his lips but sighed, ";In the face of such genius, the rest of us will all be overshadowed.";
It wasn't just being overshadowed, they didn't even have the qualifications to serve as mere foil.
On the other side.
";Is he a human or a ghost?"; The black-clothed woman was extremely astonished, ";Can a person really be this much of a genius?";
";Of course he can!"; Lu Yuan smiled bitterly. He had seen how monstrous Jiang Ming was all along. Although he had grown accustomed to it, his heart was still very shocked.
Unexpectedly, he had broken through during the battle into the Great Grandmaster Realm, even cutting down Xuanming Master, as if in a myth.
";I've truly broadened my horizons."; The black-clothed woman removed her kerchief, revealing her stunning beauty with a hint of rarely seen, compelling aura. ";Brother Lu, you must introduce me.";
";He's definitely very happy to meet you, Miss Yan!"; A weird look flashed across Lu Yuan's face.
Chang Qing's face was full of admiration.
Their commander had actually slain a Great Grandmaster, an incredible accomplishment against the heaven.
";Commander!"; Seeing Jiang Ming open his eyes, Changqing hurriedly walked over.
Lu Yuan and the black-clothed woman also approached.
Constable Jin also came over and bowed to the woman.
";Congratulations, Brother Jiang, for not only becoming a Great Grandmaster but also slaying a big demon head. From now on, there is truly a place for you in this world."; Lu Yuan congratulated them and also returned the two secret methods.
";Brother Lu, you are wrong!"; Miss Yan exclaimed, ";Brother Jiang has already reached the peak of martial arts. It's not a matter of a place, but controlling the world. Given time, it's not impossible to be invincible in the world.";
";Brother Jiang, she is Yan Feng, titled Fengwu, Princess Fengwu, and is also called Ninth Princess due to her ninth rank."; Lu Yuan introduced, ";She has just arrived to deal with Zhang Tong and then the Xiao and Liang families, but happened to run into you. By the way, when the Black Iron Army was dealing with the Xiao family previously, the Ninth Princess had helped with her forces, preventing significant losses. Haha, it's fate.";
";Thank you, Ninth Princess!"; Jiang Ming bowed his hand. Her appearance was so beautiful that it made his heart beat faster, ";Please, let's sit and talk inside the city.";
";Alright!"; The Ninth Princess was very happy, showing no airs of being a princess.
";Everyone!"; Jiang Ming looked around at Bai Yunfei and the others, ";I will be staying at the Wangyue Lake in the city. How about drinking a glass of water and wine together?";
";It's our honor to be invited by a Great Grandmaster!"; Bai Yunfei and the others were overjoyed.
They couldn't even imagine that Jiang Ming was already a Grandmaster and was still inviting them without airs. Who wouldn't agree, who dared not agree!
Everyone immediately stepped forward.
";Chang Qing, arrange someone to clean up the battlefield.!"; After making simple arrangements, Jiang Ming entered Mount Dependence City under the escort of everyone.
Liang Dashan sighed as he watched the departing figure, ";I still remember the ancestral teachings. No matter how large the family is or how strong they are, they must be humble and prudent, because no one can predict whether there are any rising stars among the people they offend. If there isn't, it's nothing, but once they appear, it could bring disaster for the entire family. For many years, with the help of the Xiao family, we built Mount Dependence City like an iron bucket, even winning over Zhang Tong and controlling the lives and deaths of the people within. Unknowingly, we have forgotten the teachings and thus caused today's disaster.";
While sighing, he cursed in his heart: Damn it, how could we have offended such an extraordinary monster who may not appear once in a thousand years? It's not a man-made disaster, but the heavens do not allow our Liang family to exist!
Inside the city, the side of Wangyue Lake.
This place was meticulously maintained by the Xiao family. The lake was surrounded by weeping willows, white jade railings, pavilions everywhere, flowers competing for beauty, and birds singing.
The lake was clear, and lotus leaves were swaying.
In the center of the lake, there was a small island. From afar, one could see the bamboo garden surrounded by green bamboos, Wangyue Pavilion, fishing platforms, and a courtyard.
On the north side of the lake, there was a large estate where Jiang Ming was staying.
Despite gaining this estate without any expectation, he didn't feel embarrassed at all.
Inside the estate, there were servants provided by the Xiao family, food, etc., and a large number of servants sent by the Liang family to manage everything temporarily.
After washing and changing into a white shirt, he had an extraordinary flair.
The feast was over, and the wine and dishes were replaced with fragrant tea.
Jiang Ming took a sip, put down the teacup, looked around, and said with a smile, ";Everyone, you are all disciples of a great school with a profound heritage, and all of you practice excellent cultivation methods. I have obtained the Shaoyin Scripture and Shaoyang Scripture, and I am willing to exchange them with you, especially the heart methods.";
Seeing that they were all frowning, he continued, ";I just need the general outline of the beginning, and the specific cultivation methods can be left out.";
";In addition, I have more than ten other excellent cultivation methods, including fist, palm, leg, knife, sword, and others.";
";Are you willing to exchange them?";
Jiang Ming took out the Shaoyin Scripture and Shaoyang Scripture and placed them on the table.
";I often wonder if there's a higher realm above the Great Grandmaster level. What was the realm of the two predecessors who comprehended the Nine Yin Divine Art and Nine Yang True Scripture? Can martial arts reach the extreme and shatter the void?";
";However, the current martial world places great importance on tradition, and many people cherish their own methods, even if they are lost, and are unwilling to pass them to outsiders.";
";If this continues, how can the martial arts world flourish? How can it surpass the blue and outperform the blue?";
";What I hope for is to have a glimpse of the scenery above the realm of the Great Grandmaster.";
";And I hope that the powerful warriors of the world can come together, take out their learnings, jointly comprehend them, and create an unprecedented martial arts event.";
";Today, I am bringing these two books and more than ten other cultivation methods to be used as a starting point, a declaration to you, and to all the powerful warriors in the world. I hope to attract some like-minded people.";
";After consolidating my cultivation level, I will deduce a few more martial arts methods that can directly reach the realm of comprehension, and I will also bring them out.";
Jiang Ming's words greatly shocked Bai Yunfei and the others.
";Brother Jiang has an incredible spirit and ambition!"; The Ninth Princess was even more amazed, her beautiful eyes flashing with admiration, curiosity, and an inquisitive look.


CHAPTER-37
37 Chapter 37: Three Thousand Dao Collection

Bai Yunfei left behind the introduction and summary of the Old Yang Scripture, carefully memorized the Lesser Yang Scripture, and hurriedly took his leave, leaving a sentence behind: ";After reporting to my master in the sect, I will certainly send the complete Old Yang Scripture over.";
Tang Xiaotian, He Qianshan, and others could not resist the temptation of the two scriptures and each took out the summary of their cultivation methods to exchange and watch.
After everyone had left, Jiang Ming looked at the Ninth Princess: ";Do you want it? I can give it all to you!";
He pushed the two cultivation skills towards her.
The Ninth Princess's eyes flickered slightly, but she smiled and said, ";After all, you are a Great Grandmaster, so how should I address you?";
";Great Grandmaster is just my cultivation level."; Jiang Ming laughed, ";As you can see, Brother Lu doesn't treat me differently.";
";Brother Jiang!"; The Ninth Princess bowed slightly and leaned forward slightly, ";Since you have reached the realm of a Great Grandmaster, there is no need for you to befriend me. Now, offering these two scriptures must mean you need something, right?";
";I need access to the Dao collections, as well as various cultivation methods from the imperial family's collection, even ordinary ones are fine. I can offer ten more unique arts in exchange, is that acceptable?";
";Yes! But I don't need these two scriptures.";
";You don't need them? I was hoping you would."; Jiang Ming showed a helpless expression.
The Ninth Princess's smile became even more brilliant: ";I am not short of cultivation arts, although these two are Supreme Skills, they are not that essential for me. Brother Jiang, my condition is very simple, when I find myself in a dire situation, I ask for your help once.";
She paused for a moment, and continued seriously: ";It won't violate the chivalrous code nor Brother Jiang's true intentions, and if it is inconvenient for Brother Jiang, you can refuse at that time. In exchange, I will deliver all three thousand Dao collections, eight hundred sect cultivation methods, the rare secret arts from the Six Gates, and the Lieyang and Xuanyin Scriptures from the imperial family's collection.";
";What ambition!"; Jiang Ming was moved but laughed, ";The Lieyang and Xuanyin Scriptures are not very useful to me.";
";Brother Jiang, didn't you say you wanted to collect the Nine Yang True Scripture and Nine Yin Divine Art?"; Lu Yuan sat on the side with his wine glass, then interjected.
";I already have two of the scriptures, and after getting a few more summaries from the exchanges, I have an eighty to ninety percent confidence in deducing the Nine Yin and Nine Yang. So it's not of much use to me, but it might save me some time."; Jiang Ming spoke honestly.
Lu Yuan smacked his lips, then fell silent again.
Were those even human words?
The Nine Yin and Nine Yang had stirred up the world of martial arts for hundreds of years, profound and mysterious, and having just one part of them could create a powerful sect. Yet, now you're saying you can deduce them?
The key point is that you only got a few summaries, that's all.
This is nonsense.
But it couldn't be helped but believed.
Lu Yuan felt a bit autistic.
The Ninth Princess opened her mouth, wanting to say boasting', but recalling the previous battle and the various unique arts Jiang Ming casually used, as well as his ability to break through on the battlefield and face a Great Grandmaster.
Moreover, he had understood three realms, and most inconceivably, he had integrated the three realms into one and realized a matching sword skill. With one sword, he had slain the Great Grandmaster, Xuanming Master.
She couldn't help but twitch her mouth.
";Admire!"; The Ninth Princess struggled to spit out two words.
In the imperial family, she was hailed as a martial arts genius rarely seen in a hundred years  even the Six Gates were under her control. But compared with the person in front of her, the difference was like night and day.
The Ninth Princess had great courage, she directly wrote down the Lieyang and Xuanyin Scriptures, and had Constable Jin, who now controlled the Six Gates here, bring a large number of secret books and various Dao codes.
Jiang Ming was delighted.
The ransom money from the Xiao and Liang families was sent over, including thousand-year ginseng, silver banknotes, and books collections. He made arrangements one by one, and also asked Chang Qing to escort Xiaolan and the others.
The Heavenly Martial Army was stationed nearby, allowing Chang Qing to further train while also recovering, while the soldiers settled down and polished their skills to improve their strength.
Jiang Ming left the miscellaneous affairs to Xiaolan, either reading books or walking by the side of Wangyue Lake, enjoying the view of the water and the green willows, and having a leisurely life.
At sunset, he stopped under a weeping willow and thought: ";Realms of comprehension, in this world they are also known as true intentions, and are divided into Entry Level, Minor Success, Great Success, and Perfection.";
This was the information he had learned from his conversations with the Ninth Princess.
By comparison, Lu Yuan's foundation was still much shallower.
";Can realms of comprehension be distinguished as strong or weak, superior or inferior?";
The difference between strong and weak was obvious, just like the true meaning of rain and water. Rain is subordinate to water, and water commands rain, clearly making rain more powerful.
But what about their essence?
Jiang Ming shook his head. The martial arts foundation of this world was ultimately too inferior, and the research on this aspect was not deep enough. He still needed to wait until he returned to the Main World to further understand.
In the past few days, he had also comprehended Lesser Yin and Lesser Yang's unique cultivation skills, even reverse-calculating the Nine Yang True Scripture and Nine Yin Divine Art to a great extent.
In fact, he didn't care much about these two divine abilities.
What he cared about was trying to comprehend the Yin-Yang True Intent through them. Unfortunately, he had no clues.
";Let's settle for what's attainable first, comprehend ten different true intents, and achieve the conditions to solidify my talent. Otherwise, if I accidentally break through, there will be nowhere to cry.";
";Next, using Water and Fire as the benchmarks and the Way of the Five Elements, I wonder if I can comprehend Yin and Yang.";
";There are also Life and Death, pure Sword Intention, Blade Intention, Fist Intention, etc.";
";What about Space? Time? Infinite, and so on";
Jiang Ming's thoughts scattered, but he couldn't help but laugh.
Setting goals too high can easily end in disappointment. Even the Main World might not have records about the Spatial Realm, let alone here.
He looked up and saw the Weeping Willows swaying in the wind. Plucking a leaf, he sensed a touch of vibrant vitality from within and immersed himself in it.
After a while, his body rippled with vitality, causing the surrounding flowers and plants to sway slightly.
Jiang Ming's own life force also grew stronger.
Wood's True Intent.
Comprehension successful!
";It's too simple; really too simple.";
He couldn't help but sigh.
The Ninth Princess walking nearby heard his voice and sensed the pervasive vitality force. She smiled and hurried over: ";Brother Jiang, have you comprehended another realm?";
";Wood's True Intent!"; Jiang Ming nodded. ";Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water – the Way of the Five Elements, mutual promotion and restraint, I have already comprehended Wood and Water, next I will try to comprehend the other three.";
";You"; The Ninth Princess opened her mouth, wanting to curse him as abnormal.
His casual tone, however, left her utterly defeated.
";Brother Jiang, I'm going to return to the Capital City today. The Three Thousand Dao Collection and many other cultivation skills will be sent here one after the other. Constable Jin will still stay here, overseeing the Six Gates' branch. You can find her directly if you need anything."; The Ninth Princess was free and easy, taking her leave after speaking.
She didn't want to stay here anymore; her heart couldn't take it.
Jiang Ming's life was bland yet abundant.
Two months later, he let Chang Qing lead the Heavenly Martial Army into the mountains for more hunting, then detouring to the north where Beimang connected with them, hunting mountain bandits and barbarians for cultivation.
The enemies were too weak. With his Great Grandmaster Realm cultivation and the help of a thousand-year Ginseng, he forcibly raised their cultivation level to the Innate Realm and even tempered their bodies once.
";With numerous unique skills, a more refined Seven Kills Sword Skill, and the Art of War Array Combat, this journey will bring them into open waters. I hope they can give me some surprises in the future!";
Jiang Ming gazed at the distant mountains, his thoughts surging.
This was also a leisurely move.
He focused his eyes, the system screen appeared before him, and he looked at the changes in information, quite satisfied.


CHAPTER-38
38 Chapter 38: Ten Realms of Comprehension, Yin and Yang, Unprecedented and Unparalleled Throughout History

Name: Jiang Ming
Qi Cultivation: Third Layer (Gang Qi Realm)
Body Cultivation: Third Transition
Skill: Yin and Yang Power, Longxiang Dominator Body Skill; Great River Sword Intent, Drop Rain One Sword, Thunderstorm Blade, Six Meridians Divine Sword and so on
Talent: Hundredfold Comprehension, Reincarnation of Nirvana, Soul Dominator (Temporary Solidification)
Mission: Become the Province Top Scorer in the Martial Arts Exam Preliminary Selection stage
The situation hasn't changed much.
In the Main World, his cultivation level is only at the Third layer of martial arts. Even if he comprehends the realm of comprehension, it still belongs to this realm.
Longxiang Dominator Body Skill has been cultivated to the peak of the Fifth Layer, equivalent to the Third Transition level in the Main World. As for the Sixth Layer? After pondering and comprehending, he found numerous errors and realized that it was impossible to cultivate successfully.
He tried to deduce and improve it, but unfortunately could not break through to a higher level. It wasn't that he was incapable, but the suppression of this world.
He has already abandoned the Guiyuan Sutra.
Jiang Ming has reverse-engineered the Nine Yin and Nine Yang from the Lesser Yin and Lesser Yang Scriptures and merged them to create the Yin and Yang Power. However, due to the short time and desire to create an unprecedented skill, it was not yet perfect.
Even so, the quality of the transformed true Qi has improved a lot. Moreover, the true Qi in his Dantian is constantly circulating like the Tai Chi diagram, one Yin and one Yang, rotating non-stop and allowing his true Qi to circulate throughout his body at all times.
It even automatically forms a protective Gang Qi.
There are also many other wonderful uses.
He didn't comprehend many unique skills, only further perfecting the Great River Sword Intent, which is integrated with the Realm of Water. With one sword, it is like a mighty river, a falling Milky Way, and unstoppable.
The most important thing is that the talent of Reincarnation of Nirvana has been solidified. It is because he has comprehended ten realms: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water, Wind, Weight, Suppression, Ice, Cloud and Fog, and Sharpness.
Weight and Suppression actually belong to the Earth's artistic conception, but they are also specific realms, and there is also the Sharp True Intent which belongs to the Metal State.
";Barely passable!";
Jiang Ming whispered, a smile appearing on his face.
With the improvement of his cultivation, tempering of his will, and sublimation of his self, his comprehension is also enhanced. What about adding a hundredfold?
Terrifying beyond common sense.
Moreover, the talent of Soul Dominator made comprehending the realms as simple as drinking water for him.
Once he stepped into the threshold and directly felt what the true meaning was, it was easy for him to infer other things by analogy.
Jiang Ming also discovered that as his strength increased, these two talents became more and more terrifying.
Unfortunately, the talent of Soul Dominator' he obtained at the Second Realm of martial arts had not yet been solidified, leaving him helpless.
In addition, the talent of Reincarnation of Nirvana is also very powerful. When practicing, he seemed tireless, his power inexhaustible, and his endurance shocking.
One day, he also tried to test it by using a treasure blade to cut a wound on his arm. As a result, the wound healed even before the blood could flow out.
";I'm not human anymore!";
Jiang Ming often lamented his abnormality.
Inside the manor, under the pavilion, he was browsing through a Daoist book that the Ninth Princess had sent over. It was not just 3,000 volumes, but also many cultivation skills and so on.
Bai Yunfei also came once to deliver the true copy of the Old Yang Scripture, leaving an invitation for Jiang Ming to attend Elder Zhang's 100th birthday celebration next year.
The remaining few also sent the true copies.
It turned out to be a pleasant surprise.
Every day, Jiang Ming's foundation and accumulation grew deeper and stronger.
";This is the real treasure in the Secret Realm World, which is the wisdom and knowledge summarized by countless geniuses over the years."; Jiang Ming sighed as he put down the book and took a sip from the teacup that Lan handed over, saying, ";You should also find some time for more cultivation.";
";Young Master, all I want is to serve you well!"; Lan sat next to him, peeling grapes and placing them in a small jade-green bowl.
";Behave, and find time to cultivate diligently. Otherwise, you will become a burden to me."; Jiang Ming had to say something harsh.
Lan's face changed, and she quickly said, ";Young Master, I will definitely cultivate diligently.";
At this moment, constable Jin walked in from outside.
She often came over, strolling in and looking at the peeled grapes, picking up the small bowl and pouring it into her mouth.
";Miss Jin, those were prepared for the Young Master!"; Lan immediately became unhappy.
";You are clever and capable, just peel some more."; constable Jin sat down, looking at Jiang Ming and said, ";Brother Jiang, the rumors about you outside have suddenly changed direction.";
";Someone is slandering me?"; Jiang Ming said.
He got a lot of information from the outside world from the other party.
In addition, there was some gossip that Lu Yuan had found out, but this guy spent most of his time wandering outside.
";Yes!"; Constable Jin nodded, ";Some time ago, it was said that you were a once-in-eternity martial arts prodigy, unparalleled in history, breathtakingly beautiful. At a young age, not only did you enter the Great Grandmaster Realm, but you also killed Xuanming Master, startling the world and causing countless powerful people to be shocked and many younger generations to worship you.";
";You were even willing to exchange your peerless martial arts skills with others. With such courage, who can compare? Even Elder Zhang seemed to be a little weaker.";
";But recently, there have been many rumors saying you are from a bandit background, engaged in evil deeds, committing all kinds of crimes, destroying the Xiao and Liang family with a heritage of hundreds of years in Mount Dependence City, and killing dozens of disciples from famous sects. It is said that you were planted by Sun and Moon Devil Sect to enter the righteous path and prepare for the resurgence of the Tianxia Sects.";
";Also, there are countless acts of exterminating villages and households, and committing rape and corruption.";
";You are a complete villain, a big demon head, a sinner who commits every crime!";
Constable Jin couldn't help showing angerin his words.
";They are slandering!"; Lan was angry.
But Jiang Ming didn't care and laughed, ";So, will the righteous path unite together and start a demon hunting alliance against me?";
";Brother Jiang is amazing!"; Constable Jin gave a thumbs up, ";Indeed, there are many voices that intend to start a demon hunting alliance against you.";
";Is Dalin Temple taking the lead?"; Jiang Ming asked curiously.
";Brother Jiang, why would you say that?";
";Didn't I kill their genius disciple?";
";That's also true. This is one reason, and perhaps they do not want another powerful force to appear in the world of martial arts, challenging their position. However, the various voices in the world of martial arts are calling for it, and Dalin Temple has neither agreed nor refused, their attitude is very ambiguous.";
";They probably want to see the attitude of other sects!"; Jiang Ming laughed, ";Let them jump around!";
";Aren't you afraid?"; Constable Jin asked curiously.
";Afraid?"; Jiang Ming shook his head and laughed, ";On the contrary, I am somewhat looking forward to it. If they really come, I will have a reason to enter their sect and kill.";
Constable Jin's heart felt a chill.
";My identity as a great grandmaster cannot be changed, and I am alone and weak. Isn't there anyone above who wants to recruit me?"; Jiang Ming pointed to the sky.
Constable Jin immediately understood Jiang Ming's meaning. It must be referring to the princes. After all, the Old Emperor was already old and didn't have much time left.
The princes fought openly and secretly, and they were all desperate to win. A strong person like Jiang Ming should have been sought after.
";I heard that a few of them were indeed tempted. When they were about to act, the Ninth Princess sent them a message, saying that you hate evil and can't stand bullying the good. The Xiao and Liang families were destroyed for doing so. In addition, the rumors in the martial arts world about a demon hunting alliance might have discouraged them."; Constable Jin revealed a strange expression.
";None of them are good people!"; Jiang Ming sighed.
Constable Jin didn't say anything, but poured himself a cup of tea from the teapot.
After the other party left, Jiang Ming pondered in secret.
Demon hunting?
He didn't really care, but he had to create some killer moves just in case he got besieged so that he could start a killing spree.
";Not to mention the Longxiang Dominator Body Skill, this body refining method is ultimately shallow and can't tap into the potential of the flesh.";
This was not an illusion, but a perception of a strong spirit and soul, coupled with the powerful vitality bestowed by the Reincarnation of Nirvana. If the body were not tempered to the extreme, it would be a waste of his unique endowed conditions.
";In addition, there is the True Intent! I should strive to merge the Five Elements True Intent into one, integrate it into the sword technique, and try to comprehend thunder, light, darkness, life and death, yin and yang, etc.";
";I should also try to explore the realm of space!";
";As well as the purest Sword Intention! With Sword Intention as the foundation, integrating other True Intents will definitely increase the strength of the sword technique by several levels.";
Jiang Ming made a simple plan.
As time flowed slowly, Constable Jin constantly brought news from the outside world.
As for the encirclement of Jiang Ming  the Great Demon, there were powerful people who invited Zhen Wu Sect but were refused. Chunyang Sect stayed out of it, and Divine Sword Villa simply ignored it.
";Brother Jiang, the Demon Hunting Alliance has been established!"; One day, constable Jin rushed over with a piece of news, her face was ugly, and she couldn't help but worry.
Demon?
She knew better than anyone that in the whole world of martial arts, Jiang Ming was the real righteous path, while most of the others were just fame-seeking people. Moreover, they were just a self-serving interest group formed under the tacit agreement that the banner of righteousness was useful.
";I hope they come soon, so I can loosen up my bones!"; Jiang Ming's eyes lit up, full of anticipation.
Constable Jin


CHAPTER-39
39 Chapter 39: Overwhelming Killing Intent

Jiang Ming didn't care about any alliance.
It would be a good opportunity for him to warm up and let them know the terror of the ";Big Demon Head";.
He was still immersed in reading and cultivation.
Wangyue Lake, on the island in the lake.
Here, Jiang Ming was alone. He was on a huge green stone, his body slightly undulating. With an open mouth, a torrent of primal qi gushed in; with a spit, a gale stirred the sky.
Roar!
His blood roared through his body like thunder, unstoppable and endless.
His heartbeat was like the war drums, each beat making the air tremble lightly.
The powerful Power of Blood had already caused the surrounding rocks to crack. The bloody smoke from his head gathered and rushed into the sky. Even the opening and closing of his pores were exchanging energy with the energy of Heaven and Earth.
With each breath, his Power of Blood became stronger.
However, at this moment, a figure walked on the water swiftly, quickly arriving at the island and landing not far away. Feeling the terrifying aura emanating from Jiang Ming, the figure couldn't help but be moved: ";Like the sky collapses, like a tsunami, I feel he could kill me with a casual blow!";
The person who came was none other than Lu Yuan.
";This demon, he's gotten stronger.";
";No, I feel he's ten times stronger than when he killed Xuanming Master. No, more than ten times. Even I, who have reached the peak of the Master-class, can hardly bear his pressure!";
";Is this guy going against the heavens?";
Lu Yuan grinned.
";When I first met him, he was stronger than me, but only by a limited amount. But every day since then, he has progressed rapidly. Now, I don't even feel like I can walk up to him when his full power is unleashed.";
";I'm a genius too!";
Lu Yuan sighed.
Facing such a person, he really felt powerless, without even the urge to compete.
Jiang Ming had already stopped and opened his eyes, looking at Lu Yuan with a smile, ";What do you think of the body tempering technique I created using Longxiang Dominator Body Skill as a reference and learning from dozens of body refining methods?";
He stood up and walked down, the green stone behind him silently cracking and shattering.
";Awesome!"; What else could Lu Yuan say but give a thumbs up.
";Haha!"; Jiang Ming laughed, ";Of course it's awesome. Now that I've cultivated it to the same level as Longxiang Dominator Body Skill, I'm dozens of times stronger.";
It's not a false claim, but a substantial improvement.
For this body refining method, he used his own physique as a reference, even resorting to self-mutilation to practice, tempering his flesh, strengthening his tendons and bones, enhancing his internal organs, and bringing out the full potential of his body step by step.
Fortunately, with the talent of Reincarnation of Nirvana, even if he forcibly practiced and injured his internal organs, he could recover quickly without fear of injury.
At the same time, he nourished his body with his immense Qi and cleansed it with the Power of Truth. In just a few months, his physical limit reached a level that is unimaginable for ordinary people.
";Damn!"; Lu Yuan could only spit out a word.
Jiang Ming's gaze became cold, looking at the other party and couldn't help but frown, ";You're covered in dirt and your hair is disheveled, have you been chased and killed?";
";No, with your current strength, there aren't many who can chase and kill you. In this city, I haven't felt the presence of a Great Grandmaster.";
";So, it's for me.";
";Something happened? Involving me?"; Jiang Ming's frown deepened, and he closed his eyes, releasing terrifying Killing Qi as if it became substantial. His voice didn't stop, ";The only thing that concerns me and makes you so anxious must be the Heavenly Martial Army or the Black Wind Village. I already entrusted the Ninth Princess to take care of the Heavenly Martial Army, and she would inform me the moment anything went wrong. So, it must be that something happened to the Black Wind Village. Last time you left to go to the southwest, and that was where the Black Wind Village was.";
";Was it slaughtered?";
";Nine out of ten chances!";
";It's not hard for people to investigate the relationship between me and Black Wind Village.";
";I've already been labeled as the Big Demon Head, and many forces in the world of martial arts want to hunt me down together. By causing trouble there, it would provoke my anger, getting me to start a massacre? Or use the forces of the Jianghu Alliance to consume my power?";
";Heh";
Jiang Ming opened his eyes, shooting out two substantial rays of light, ";Brother Lu, am I right?";
Lu Yuan opened his mouth and finally nodded with a heavy heart, ";I went over there to look around since it wasn't far away and found the entire mountain littered with corpses, not a single survivor. Brother Jiang, my condolences!";
";Did you find any clues?";
";No. Common cultivation skills were used, but all of them were fatal and efficient.";
";Interesting. Whether they're trying to sow discord or forcing me to go mad and exhaust my power, I'll make them regret it."; Jiang Ming clasped his hands behind his back and turned to look at the slightly rippling lake. ";No matter who it is, they will eventually reveal themselves. Sigh, although I don't have much affection for the mountain stronghold, it was once my dwelling place, and I had put my heart into managing it. I had thought that with my Great Grandmaster Realm cultivation, even if someone wanted to deal with me, they wouldn't target the stronghold first, because once discovered, no one can bear the wrath of a Great Grandmaster. I underestimated people after all.";
";Brother Lu, I have a favor to ask of you. Can you watch over Tianwu Manor these days?"; Jiang Ming's voice was solemn.
Lu Yuan's heart chilled, ";Alright!";
He showed hesitation but did not speak.
Watch over Tianwu Manor?
As the master of the manor, can't a Great Grandmaster secure it? There's only one possibility: he's about to go on a killing spree, and when he goes mad with killing, it's inevitable that someone will seize the opportunity to bloodbath the manor.
At this time, another figure appeared on the lake surface, treading on the water like a fairy walking on waves. However, compared to Lu Yuan's elegance, she was still somewhat lacking.
It was none other than Constable Jin.
After bounding up to Jiang Ming's side, she glanced at Lu Yuan and then felt the intense murderous intent on Jiang Ming that made her heart tremble in fear. She pursed her lips and said, ";Brother Jiang, you already know?";
";I know, Black Wind Village was slaughtered!"; Jiang Ming nodded, his tone calm. It was this very calmness that sent a chill down Constable Jin's spine. She quickly said, ";We have already sent people to investigate. Brother Jiang, is there anything I can do for you?";
";Help me protect Tianwu Manor, okay?"; This manor was one of the ones on the north side of the lake. Now, it was being managed by Lan and there were still quite a few servants like Old Ma.
";Alright!";
";Also, help me keep an eye on the Demon Exterminating Army!";
";Alright!";
";You're free to browse the cultivation skill manuals and secret techniques in my study!";
";Brother Jiang, I'm not alright, thank you."; Constable Jin tried to explain but ended up immediately agreeing.
Although they hadn't known each other for long, she knew Jiang Ming's character.
He truly didn't care about so-called unique techniques and secret methods.
";Brother Jiang, they've already set off in this direction, with a large number of people. Normally, even a large crowd wouldn't dare to deal with a Great Grandmaster. But they're coming. Apart from being blinded by numerous cultivation skills and secret techniques, they must firmly believe that they have a chance to kill you. That means there must be a Great Grandmaster behind them, and probably more than one!"; Constable Jin voiced her conjecture with great urgency and concern.
";Great Grandmaster? Whoever comes will die!"; Jiang Ming reached out and grabbed, a torrent of qi gushing out, condensing into a hundred-meter-long sword in his hand.
Qi condensed into a weapon—a hundred-meter-long sword?
It was not just sword qi, but a substantial weapon formed from qi.
This scene almost made Constable Jin and Lu Yuan's eyes pop out in astonishment.
Jiang Ming dropped the sword from the sky, splitting the lake in half and raising a terrifying wave.
";Inhuman!"; Constable Jin exclaimed involuntarily.
";Only when I can cut Mount Dependence City in half with a single sword will I have entered the threshold of inhumanity!"; Jiang Ming replied, causing Constable Jin to want to curse aloud: Split the city in half with one sword? You really dare to think! Do you think you're an immortal!
Lu Yuan stared at the sky in silence.
Three days later, at a hill five miles outside the east City Gate, Jiang Ming stood atop it.
He carried a saber and a sword on his back.
It was the divine weapon given to him by the Ninth Princess, which he named the Heaven Slicing Saber and the Heaven Splitting Sword!
It held a special significance.
Today, blood would be shed.
";They're here!";
A large group of people appeared in the distance, followed by an extremely thick cloud of killing qi, as if it wanted to engulf him completely.


CHAPTER-40
Chapter 40: Chapter 40: Slaughter Sword Intent

Up ahead were people from the world of martial arts. But what was bizarre was that the team was scattered but not chaotic, and no one dared to be the first to rush to the front. Especially when they saw Jiang Ming, the chaotic noise suddenly disappeared, and even the forward footsteps stopped in unison without agreement.
People’s reputation preceded them, and everyone was timid in the face of a Great Grandmaster.
Jiang Ming laughed, with a hint of mockery.
No one was behind him, but there were countless enemies ahead.
“Everyone, since ancient times, demons have not suppressed the righteous, and righteousness will always triumph over evil. This man is a great demon that is beyond redemption. Although he is powerful, he will certainly be no match for our forces of justice!” A middle-aged man in the front of the team waved his hand and strode towards Jiang Ming with his head held high.
His square face gave people a sense of righteousness, and he didn’t have the slightest sideways glance, full of integrity.
The others followed suit.
“Jiang Ming, you murdered villages and kidnapped and plundered. Kneel down and confess now!” The middle-aged man stopped under the mound and looked up to question Jiang Ming.
“Kneel down and confess!”
The rest of the people shouted angrily, pointing their sabers, spears, swords, and halberds at Jiang Ming.
Jiang Ming laughed and asked, “You are Zhao Zhengyi, right? Which village did
1 slaughter, and which stronghold did I destroy?”
Constable Jin provided him with a lot of information, and based on the description, Jiang Ming recognized this leading middle-aged man at first sight.
He was from Fengzhou, a grandmaster cultivator, known as a righteous true gentleman, and a moral role model Zhao Daxia.
There were more than twenty innate powerhouses and three grandmasters hidden in the crowd, obviously concealing their identity.
This wave of people was very powerful and could sweep through a sect.
Even enough to besiege a great grandmaster.
“Feng Family Village, Ma Family Village, you wiped them out, killing everyone regardless of age or gender, you were the epitome of evil!” Zhao Zhengyi’s face was filled with rage as he pointed at Jiang Ming.
“Going by what you’re saying, I’m really beyond redemption, full of sin and doing all kinds of evil.” Jiang Ming said indifferently, “Who saw it?”
“I saw it!” A young man stepped forward, fearful but determined, “At that time, I was hiding in the bushes and watched you laugh and kill while raping for pleasure. Then you took out a girl’s heart and ate it clean. You are a demon, a demon! I often have nightmares and wake up in a cold sweat!”
“You slaughtered villages, ate hearts, and claim you’re not a demon!” Zhao Zhengyi’s rage knew no bounds, roaring, “Jiang Ming, you may act like a human in front of others, but behind their backs, you are an evil ghost that crawled out of hell.”
The others looked at Jiang Ming with icy cold glares.
“If it was really me, with my cultivation level, I wouldn’t have noticed that there was one person hiding in secret? Ridiculous, ridiculous!” Jiang Ming shook his head.
Zhao Zhengyi’s eyes narrowed, and the others’ eyes flickered.
“And you Zhao Zhengyi, to be called a righteous true gentleman, and a moral role model Zhao Daxia. What a great reputation.” Jiang Ming continued, “I’ve heard that when you were young and poor, you accidentally acquired a secret manual and gradually grew into the grandmaster realm you are in today. This kind of talent is rare in this world. Your reputation is due to the fact that as long as any martial artist in need comes to your door, you treat them well and give them at least a hundred taels of silver when they leave, sometimes even thousands. That’s why you’re called generous and chivalrous, right?”
“Of course!” Zhao Zhengyi puffed out his chest, looking righteous, “Jiang Ming, if you confess, I can spare your life.”
Jiang Ming sneered, “You have no family fortune, and you haven’t set up any businesses, yet you have a huge mansion covering more than 80 acres that’s lavishly decorated and have hundreds of servants. You also generously support martial artists. So tell me, Zhao Zhengyi, where does your money come from?”
“This…” Zhao Zhengyi’s face suddenly changed.
“Heh, this is the so-called Zhao Daxia, a moral role model in public, but a scoundrel in private. The world of martial arts is full of people who are more interested in worldly affairs than chivalry.” Jiang Ming shook his head, no longer bothering with them and instead yelled at the young man, “Tell me, were you coerced or threatened to come and slander me?”
The roar was like thunder from the Nine Heavens.
In his eyes, a faint gleam flashed as he activated the spirit power-formed bewitching technique. The young man’s willpower couldn’t stand against it.
The young man shuddered, his expression changed slightly, and blurted out, “Yes, yes, Zhao Zhengyi came to me and said that as long as I slandered you for slaughtering a village, he would give me thirty thousand taels…”
Before he could finish, Zhao Zhengyi slapped him to death, then pointed at Jiang Ming and roared, “You great demon, you dare to kill the witness in front of me, you’re lawless and shameless! Everyone, follow me and kill this demon for the sake of avenging the dead and bringing justice to the world.”
He charged forward, wielding his sword, releasing waves of Sword Qi that looked as majestic as they could be, seemingly able to kill all enemies, but his steps obviously slowed down.
“Kill!”
Shouts came from the crowd.
Many martial artists instinctively rushed forward.
Jiang Ming, on the mound, showed a look of astonishment and couldn’t help but curse, “Motherfucker, I’ve never seen such blatant slander before. The world of martial arts, the world of martial arts, huh…”
A while ago, when Constable Jin told him about the darkness in the world of martial arts, he didn’t pay much attention.
But today’s scene made him completely disappointed in the so-called martial arts world.
Extremely disappointed.
Heroes?
In the end, they are nothing but fireflies in the dark, too few and far between.
Most of them are unprincipled and immoral people, with no loyalty to any cause or morals.
In fact, with the killing intent in his heart, he should have started a massacre when the people appeared before him, but he ultimately came from a civilized society. He thought that some people were bewitched, so he explained and hoped some would back down.
However, what he saw was the true face of the world of martial arts.
How many good people could come here, obviously all had their own intentions.
He also noticed Bai Yunfei and others approaching, which was another way of showing their attitude. At the same time, there were three great grandmasters hidden in the dark who came with the team, but they could not hide from him.
“Lethal Kill Formation!”
Jiang Ming made a judgment at the first moment. However, he didn’t really care.
The greedy people in front of him were obviously sent to drain his strength. As for daring to strike at the great grandmaster? It must be the courage given to them by the four grandmasters in the team, coupled with more than twenty innate realm powerhouses. This luxurious lineup would make anyone brave.
Clang!
The Heaven Splitting Sword appeared and shattered all kinds of remote attacks coming for the kill, and he charged down.
“If I don’t massacre today, 1 won’t be satisfied!”
Without world-ending killing techniques or hundreds of meters of Sword Qi, he just swung his Heaven Splitting Sword, harvesting lives one by one. Blood blossomed, and life withered.
Every time his sword fell, someone was killed.
But even when he killed his way into the crowd, no one touched his clothes, and even the hidden weapons flying all over the sky were all blocked.
First-tier?
Innate?
All ended with one sword strike.
“Zhao Zhengyi, you want to kill me, why do you keep retreating?”
Jiang Ming stared at his opponent, advancing step by step with killing intent.
He wasn’t rushing, but his killing intent grew stronger and stronger, causing some martial artists who besieged him to feel frightened and show fear.
Some wanted to retreat, but they were killed by sudden Sword Qi.
Run?
Too late!
I’m not retreating, I’m preparing a killing move!” Zhao Zhengyi saw Jiang Ming casually killing people, and many experts around him couldn’t stop his opponent at all, which made him feel a bit frightened.
But at this point, he had no choice but to take action.
Moreover, he knew that there were great grandmasters lurking in the dark.
“The three of you, if you don’t make a move, when will you?” Zhao Zhengyi suddenly shouted.
“This villain is full of evil and should be executed!” An old voice came from the west, revealing an elderly face as one of them shook off his black robe.
His eye sockets were sunken, and his figure was skinny.
Especially his hands, like chicken claws, were covered in black, a clear sign that he had practiced toxic techniques.
“Should be executed!” This voice was very hoarse as the black robe fell off, revealing a man with a mask, holding a blade in his hand.
With a gentle turn, the cold blade Qi could kill any enemy.
“Amitabha Buddha, Master Jiang, you have committed countless evil deeds. If you do not put down your butcher knife, you will suffer the wrath of Ming Wang!” Under the black robe, a bald monk emerged, his voice compassionate, but his face full of flesh.
He held a steel rod in his hand, and with a slight movement, his clothes burst open, revealing his upper body covered in muscular, golden-like muscles.
This was the obvious result of practicing the Vajra Imperishable Body Divine Skill.
“Finally showing your true colors!” Jiang Ming slashed two people with a casual swing, and at this moment, his accumulated killing intent also reached its peak, undergoing a qualitative change.
A slaughter aura shot straight from the top of his head into the sky, shaking the heavens.
The terrifying killing intent spread out, chilling all the powerful people around. Some of them were so scared that their eyes rolled white and fainted on the spot.
“Slaughter Sword Intent? You’ve actually comprehended another true meaning!” The bald monk’s pupils shrank, his face pale, and then roared, “36 devil-subduing strikes, die!”
“Die!”
“Die!”
“Die!”
Zhao Zhengyi and the other two were all horrified, knowing that they couldn’t wait any longer. They immediately executed their ultimate killing techniques and attacked Jiang Ming..


CHAPTER-41
Chapter 41: Chapter 41: Tai Chi Diagram, Ten Thousand Swords Return to One

Slaughter is an exceedingly unique realm, generally difficult to comprehend alone. Only in the midst of combat, between the endless life and death, can one feel the special power hidden within killing and gain some enlightenment.
Using killing to achieve it, and sword to demonstrate it, results in the extremely powerful Slaughter Sword Intent.
It is second to none in the path of offense.
Although the grandmasters are yet to comprehend the power of the realm, they can still sense it.
At this moment, amidst the chills, the four grandmasters surrounding Zhao Zhengyi all took action with their pinnacle strikes, frighteningly strong, driving away all the other powerful beings.
Om om om!
The void trembled, and a horrifying murderous aura filled the sky.
Zhao Zhengyi’s sword qi soared, a single slash causing the wind to surge and the clouds to churn, grand and magnificent with a touch of softness and ruthlessness; the Great Monk’s Devil-subduing Stick, the palm of the thin Elder, and finally, the wide-ranging blade light of the last one.
These four had been scheming for a long time, and now they launched their attacks from all directions. Even a Great Grandmaster would have to change their expression when faced with their assault.
However, Jiang Ming didn’t dodge or block. Instead, he was engrossed in comprehending the Slaughter Sword Intent, understanding its deeper changes. His might continued to increase, and just as he was about to be killed, a burst of light suddenly bloomed from his body, turning into a qi barrier that enveloped him.
This was the Gang Qi Defense, but it was quite peculiar.
Above it were the intertwined forces of cold Yin and scorching Yang energy, both distinct and fusing together, extremely peculiar and Tai Chi-like, revolving around Jiang Ming at the center.
Bang…
The next moment, the attacks from all directions landed, causing the defense barrier to tremble violently, but it didn’t break.
“How is this possible?” Zhao Zhengyi exclaimed in shock.
The other three also changed their expressions.
Whose defenses couldn’t be broken by their combined attack?
Even if Elder Zhang stood still, he would be bleeding from the mouth. Yet now, they couldn’t even break a layer of Jiang Ming’s qi defense, which was truly ridiculous.
At the same time, their hearts sank, and they were inexplicably frightened.
“I’ve comprehended the Nine Yin and Nine Yang Skill, merging it to try to understand the Tai Chi Yin Yang Skill. However, there’s still something missing, so I dare not treat it as the ‘ultimate.’ I can only take the Yin and Yang Power.” Jiang Ming’s voice rang out.
However, it was obvious that he was still comprehending the Slaughter Sword Intent.
This was multitasking, no, multi-functioning.
“As for this defensive method, I employ the circulation of yin and yang, the endless cycle, the shifting of stars, borrowing strength to transfer strength, counteracting and enhancing, and so on. However, after all, it has never been used in real combat and has many flaws. Regardless, it is enough to resist you all.” Jiang Ming’s voice was light, “For this method, I have high expectations. 1’11 name it Tai Chi diagram, Yin-Yang Tai Chi Diagram! When I fully comprehend the Yin and Yang Realm, this method will be almost in its preliminary stages of perfection.”
“What kind of monster are you?” Zhao Zhengyi’s courage waned, “A few months ago, you shook the Great Grandmaster Xuanming Master with your mastery-level realm, and even broke through in battle, understanding the true meaning of ice, cloud, and rain. The fusion of three types of true meaning gave birth to the true meaning of water, unprecedented, and inconceivable. Now, you’ve comprehended Slaughter Sword Intent in battle and even created such a horrifying, far stronger than Golden Bell Shield defensive method. Jiang Ming, are you truly human? No, you definitely aren’t. Humans can never reach this level. Are you a ghost, demon, immortal, or monster?”
“Zhao Benefactor, whether he is a ghost, demon, immortal, or monster, today he must die. It is the will of the Buddha master and the will of heaven!” The bald monk was also greatly shocked, but his determination was unwavering.
Clearly, having taken action today with such a large formation,
If they retreated, with the opponent’s character, they would be pursued and killed relentlessly. So there was only one path – to annihilate the opponent.
In a life-and-death battle, there’s no retreat, only progression.
“Devil-subduing Stick, banishing ten thousand demons!”
The bald monk took action again, yet his secret skill’s name seemed to shake the heavens and earth. However, this stick was indeed terrifyingly powerful. The sky seemed about to be shattered, directly landing on Jiang Ming’s head. “Demon? Killing the demons will make me the real demon!” The elder with sunken eye sockets showed a sinister expression, his body suddenly swelling up, reaching more than two meters in height, extremely burly.
His aura surged even more, only slightly less than that of the Great Grandmaster Realm.
“God-extinguishing Finger!” He pointed at Jiang Ming, and his bloated body shrank sharply, as if all the strength in his body was gathered into this one finger.
This finger’s might even caused Jiang Ming to take notice and commented, “What a powerful secret skill, I can use it as a reference later!”
The other sword wielder remained silent and simply launched a horizontal slash.
Jiang Ming still didn’t move but became more serious.
He raised his left hand and pressed it forward. The rotating Yin-Yang Tai Chi Diagram suddenly accelerated. Upon closer inspection, one could see the numerous tiny ‘Tai Chi diagrams’ that seemed blurry and formed a somewhat unstable power.
With the attacks from all directions falling, the clarity of his Tai Chi Diagram almost collapsed but eventually stabilized, and it even ran more steady than previously.
“Indeed, true knowledge comes from actual practice.” Jiang Ming smiled, “But now, this is the end.”
“I have a sword that merges the basics of Raindrop Sword, Quick Rain Sword, Sudden Rain Sword, Drop Rain One Sword, River Sword, Six Meridians Divine Sword, Chunyang Sword, and so on, 136 types of swordsmanship into one.”
“Gather a hundred swords into one body, melt them into the origin, and exhaust the extreme changes of the sword technique.”
“I name it Ten Thousand Swords Return to One!”
“A hundred swords return to the origin, ten thousand swords return to the sect, encompassing the changes of the world’s sword techniques and demonstrating the ultimate sword techniques.”
“It still has the inclusiveness to absorb all kinds of sword techniques’ subtleties. In the end, one sword becomes the path, and one sword becomes the boundary.”
“It’s a pity that my realm is too low, and I can only achieve the basics!”
“Today, 1’11 test my sword on you!”
As soon as Jiang Ming finished speaking, the Yin-Yang Tai Chi diagram suddenly exploded, like a storm sweeping through, shaking Zhao Zhengyi and the other three people out.
Dust flying, murderous intent filling the sky.
With a trembling Heaven Splitting Sword, a series of Sword Qi burst out from his body, making the void primal qi condense into countless swords Qi all around.
It seemed like he could command thousands of ministers.
“Die!”
With one sword falling, Sword Qi turned into a rolling storm.
Like rain hitting plantains, it penetrated the air and tore everything apart.
This was truly a Sword Qi Storm.
Centered on Jiang Ming, a whirlpool formed in all directions, quickly reaching its peak.
In the next moment, a sudden scream rang out, extremely miserable.
When the four Grandmasters made their moves just now, the powerful retreated but did not go far away. Now they were all affected. Whether it was Third-tier, First-tier, or Innate existences, they were all caught up in Sword Qi and killed on the spot.
The four Grandmasters were horrified and retreated wildly.
“How can there be such a terrifying sword technique?” Zhao Zhengyi’s face was pale, his long sword spinning, emitting countless Sword Qi, but in an instant, his long sword was shattered.
Then, the protective Qi of his body was torn apart by the countless Sword Qi.
“No!” Zhao Zhengyi screamed in horror, “Save me! Save…”
In the blink of an eye, he too was submerged.
One generation ‘Hero’ died on the spot.
The rampaging Sword Qi finally dissipated.
Looking at the battlefield again, it had become a bloody wasteland, with corpses everywhere and blood everywhere.
Besides the remaining three Grandmasters, there were only a handful of powerful people who had already reached a safe distance. Everyone else was killed.
One sword killed at least a hundred people.
“He is a demon, a demon, definitely a big demon!” The Great Monk trembled.
His body was covered in countless small wounds.
According to his understanding, the boundless Sword Qi should be very weak, but that was not the case at all. Each was powerful, making his Vajra Immortal skill unable to withstand it.
Fortunately, he was strong enough that while it looked tragic, there was no actual damage to his muscles or bones.
“It’s a monster!” The sunken-eyed Elder was in a wretched state, with one arm severed.
“Demon or monster, when you came here, you were destined to face this end, especially when 1 learned of Black Wind Village’s destruction. Today, even if the Heavenly King came, you would still die.” Jiang Ming’s voice was cold, his long sword raised, his momentum climbing, seemingly ignoring Zhao Zhengyi’s desperation for help just now. Instead, he continued, “Just now, 1 didn’t incorporate the power of the realm into one sword, but the next sword…”
He laughed, a somewhat cruel laugh.
“I just happened to comprehend the Slaughter Sword Intent, so why not incorporate it and see what level this Ten Thousand Swords Return to One can reach?” Jiang Ming’s eyes condensed, killing intent erupted, causing the air to tremble and everything to fear.
Once again, countless Sword Qi appeared around him. This time, each Sword Qi contained an extremely terrifying murderous aura, much stronger than before, making people’s hairs stand on end and their hearts filled with fear.
“Die!”
The long sword fell, and ten thousand swords swept through, darkening the sky..


CHAPTER-42
Chapter 42: Chapter 42: Thousands of Hands Merge into One

The long sword fell, and Jiang Ming closed his eyes, comprehending the changes of this sword.
Using himself as a guide, and the void as the carrier, he integrated the intention of slaughter into it, transforming it into an indestructible Sword Qi Torrent.
Tearing through the sky, cutting everything.
The remaining three grandmasters were slightly resistant, but they were all torn apart by the Sword Qi, dying miserably on the spot.
When the Sword Qi dissipated, Jiang Ming’s face turned pale, he leaned on the sword, took a few deep breaths, and his strength suddenly weakened, as if he had overexerted himself and was overwhelmed.
West side.
Bai Yunfei of the Zhen Wu Sect, Tang Xiaotian of the Chunyang Sect, and He Qianshan of the Divine Sword Villa all rushed over after hearing about the extermination of demons. They gathered together, just in time to witness this unprecedented Great War.
“Zao Zhengyi, 1 knew he was a bastard. He pretended to be a moral role model, but was secretly a scoundrel. Damn it, his disguise was just too good.” “Yeah, his disguise was too good! This guy casually accused Brother Jiang of massacring and plundering, and this move is indeed astonishing.”
“If it were anyone else, they might have fallen victim to his conspiracy, but who is Brother Jiang? An ordinary person can hardly escape his detection! Huh, Brother Jiang claims he has no property, but he has such a large estate and so on. We felt something was wrong before, but we didn’t think about it this way. Now that it’s been exposed, upon reflection, it seems quite horrifying. How many evil deeds has Zhao Zhengyi, the righteous hero, committed in secret? When he said that Brother Jiang massacred villages and committed heinous crimes, could it have been him who did it?”
“There’s a high likelihood! The villain of such monstrous crimes has become a righteous hero; truly ironic!”
“Not a single one of these people is good. Look, none of the major sects came.”
“As expected of Brother Jiang, facing encirclement without fear, and still killing ruthlessly, one sword, one life, neat and clean.”
“Three grandmasters were hidden, one of them was Guangming, the high-ranking monk from Dalin Temple. The Dalin Temple, heh, with such a large family and business, daring to attack a great grandmaster, it’s puzzling.” “Maybe it’s for avenging Huijian, after all, he was the most talented disciple of Dalin Temple. Or maybe Jiang Ming has mastered too many unique skills and has a sure-kill capability, so they want to share the spoils.”
“A sure-kill capability? Hiss, so the other two…”
“The one with the knife seems like a strongman from the North Barbarian; the other one feels like someone from the Sun and Moon Demon Sect.”
“If that’s the case, Brother Jiang is in trouble, big trouble.”
“I don’t know if it’s troublesome or not, but I just know that Brother Jiang is really terrifying. In the midst of the Great War, he actually comprehended the Slaughter Sword Intent. Is he really human?”
“Could it be the reincarnation of an immortal?”
“Good guy, this sword is too scary, the Sword Qi fills the sky like smoke, slaying hundreds of enemies with one sword, Zhao Zhengyi, the hypocrite, was also executed, truly gratifying, truly satisfying!”
“Speaking of which, what kind of strength can actually create such terrifying Sword Qi? Can a Great Grandmaster really do it? I don’t believe it!”
“I don’t believe it either, it’s too terrifying. Can a human really achieve this? Even my master might not reach this level.” Bai Yunfei showed a look of intense shock, “With the same sword, but even more terrifying, the three grandmasters were killed directly, one of whom had practiced the Vajra Imperishable Body Divine Skill from the Dalin Temple. It’s incredible, unbelievable. It’s not good, Brother Jiang has consumed too much, and there might be big trouble next. I can’t believe these people would dare to come and besiege Brother Jiang knowing he killed several grandmasters a few months ago, and even killed a Great Grandmaster, if they didn’t have other means.” “How can 1 not believe that Brother Jiang will be weak?” Tang Xiaotian frowned, “Remember last time, he also showed fatigue and weakness? But in the end, he lured out the enemies and killed them with his might. What do you think, is he doing it on purpose?”
“But, but, but just now he burst out with that kind of terrifying Sword Intent. Wouldn’t his Qi within his body be hollowed out?” Bai Yunfei shook his head, “That sword is a secret skill, a unique technique, and it uses Slaughter Sword Intent. How huge is the consumption? If it’s a pretense, then… how vast must his Dantian and Sea of Qi be?”
At this moment, all of their pupils contracted, revealing a look of horror.
Because they saw three figures coming to the center of the battlefield in the blink of an eye, trapping Jiang Ming in the middle and attacking without any hesitation.
“They’re all Great Grandmasters!” Bai Yunfei shuddered.
The others also changed their expressions.
In the battlefield.
Jiang Ming, who was leaning on his sword, suddenly straightened up. Facing the three Great Grandmasters who suddenly appeared and attacked him, his body shook, and Qi burst forth from his body, forming a Yin-Yang Tai Chi diagram to protect him.
However, it was broken by the combined efforts of the three.
“Not bad!” Jiang Ming fended the three off with a casual swing of his sword, “I was afraid you wouldn’t make a move, so I pretended to be weak on purpose. I didn’t expect you to really fall for it.”
“Die!” One of the burly middle-aged men clenched a mountain-splitting axe in his hand, leaped into the air, and chopped down an astonishing axe light from above. It seemed as though the sky and the earth were split apart by his powerful strike.
The terrifying force also contained a very special power.
“Amitabha Buddha, A Thousand Hands Return to One, Buddha’s Light Shines Everywhere!” This was an old monk who floated towards Jiang Ming while emitting a rich golden light from his body, making him look like a demon-conquering Vajra.
With just one palm, there were countless palm prints that covered half of the sky dome. Finally, these palm prints converged into one, gathering the ultimate power.
“Soul Extinguishing Finger!” The last person spun around and darted toward Jiang Ming with several afterimages, eventually pointing a finger at the back of Jiang Ming’s head. This finger carried the breath of annihilating everything one finger to extinguish the soul.
It was as fast as a shooting star, reaching its ultimate point in a flash.
“Ten Thousand Swords Return to One!” Jiang Ming’s eyebrows twitched as his sword Qi and Killing Qi surged, driving back the three attackers like a slaughter wind that soared into the sky.
However, the collision of their powers created a terrifying storm that split the ground apart, making even the faraway Bai Yunfei and others back away in fear, not daring to approach any closer.
Within a radius of one hundred meters, there was chaos and dust everywhere.
In the blink of an eye, they suppressed it.
This time, they didn’t immediately make a move again.
“Considering your last battle, there’s no way that you could be weak. You just pretended to be weak to lure us into action. How arrogant!” The Great Monk said in a low tone, “But I never thought you would be this strong. The three of us teamed up and still couldn’t handle you. Even Master Zhang might not be able to reach this level. It’s inconceivable.”
He really felt it was inconceivable.
The three of them had used their ultimate killing moves just now, and apart from Master Zhang, they were confident that they could at least severely wound any other Great Grandmaster.
But Jiang Ming managed to block them.
The expressions of the other two also became extremely solemn.
“The reason why you find it inconceivable is simply that you’re all too weak,” Jiang Ming looked at them sharply, his eyes piercing, “You are Monk Puhui from Dalin Temple, who has practiced the Vajra Imperishable Body Divine Skill to the point of Great Success and comprehended the true meaning of the Vajra. Combining the two, you are called Vajra Holy Monk, possessing both an indestructible Vajra body and extreme power, right?”
These were secrets that the Ninth Princess had told him.
She had given him a brief introduction to the powerful figures in the world. “Yes!” The Vajra Holy Monk nodded, “1 didn’t expect you would know about me, but we haven’t been able to find out any detailed information about you. We only know that you came from Black Wind Village. As for your past, we couldn’t find out anything at all, as if you popped out of a rock. Jiang Ming, can you reveal your origin?”
“Do you know about Black Wind Village?” Jiang Ming’s eyebrows twitched slightly, “Were the people there killed by you?”
At this moment, his concentration was at its peak.
In his mind, he was reflecting the surroundings, observing their every move, and even their breathing and heartbeats. He could even sense the flow of Qi within their bodies.
“Black Wind Village was slaughtered?” The Vajra Holy Monk furrowed his eyebrows, “We wouldn’t stoop so low as to do that. Our reason for coming to kill you is to avenge Huijian, that’s all.”
Avenge a disciple?
No one believed that!


CHAPTER-43
Chapter 43: Chapter 43: The Strongest Sword, Slaying the Great Grandmaster continuously.

As for the true motives of the Vajra Holy Monk to besiege him, Jiang Ming had also made some conjectures. They probably wanted the cultivation skills in his possession: the Shaoyin Scripture and Shaoyang Scripture.
They must have also discovered that he had obtained two other scriptures from the Ninth Princess.
Not to mention the numerous general outlines of godly powers that he had traded for.
This was an immense wealth and indeed the real foundation of inheritance. The Dalin Temple could take action under the pretext of revenge, and no one could object.
The inquiries just now had disappointed him.
Among the three, none had shown any unusual reactions. They should not be aware of the massacre in the Black Wind Village.
“If it’s not these three, who else could it be?” Jiang Ming pondered, his gaze turned to the man holding the giant axe, his brows slightly furrowed: “North Barbarian, Iron Battle!”
From him, he sensed an overwhelmingly violent aura, accompanied by a sense of familiarity. This was the powerful one who had been covertly watching when he had slain the Xuanming Master months ago.
The different party paid no attention, his aura continued to escalate, clearly gathering power, preparing for an incredibly wild attack.
Jiang Ming didn’t care, he simply looked at the third person and couldn’t help but sneer coldly: “Sect Leader of the Demon Sect, Yang Kaitai. You were almost vanquished by Master Zhang, yet you failed to learn your lesson. Reaching the Great Grandmaster Realm, you dare jump out and make a stir? You’re truly courting death.”
“Good indeed, Vajra Holy Monk, your Dalin Temple not only colludes with the Demon Sect, but also joins forces with the people of North Barbarian. Are you not ashamed of the Great Yan blood flowing through your veins, are you not ashamed of the land under your feet?”
Without giving the other party a chance to speak, Jiang Ming turned to accuse the Monk Puhui, preemptively labeling him with a large hat.
His voice thundered, echoing far and wide.
“Betrayers of both country and clan, Puhui, Vajra Holy Monk, is your Dalin planning to overturn my Great Yan Dynasty? Execute!”
“Go to hell!”
“Ten Thousand Swords Return to One, Five Elements Performance!”
Jiang Ming roared angrily. Before his voice had even faded, five peculiar auras emanated from his body, stirring the void Dao Resonance and creating different realms of comprehension, each representing the true essence of the five elements: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water.
Arranged in the order of generation and restriction, then merged together, they were infused into the sword arts.
The void hummed, and the Sword Qi Storm reappeared.
This time it was much stronger than the Ten Thousands Swords Return to One Introduction that had been infused with the Slaughter Sword Intent. It was at least ten times more powerful, terrifyingly so, turning the sky dome a different color and even making the wind rise and clouds surge, a heavenly phenomenon.
The Slaughter Sword Intent was, after all, something that he had just begun to comprehend, and he had only just scratched the surface, whereas he had long comprehended the power of these five realms to the Great Success Realm.
He had even integrated the five realms in a preliminary manner to form the real power of Five Elements. Even though it was an initial integration, the might it exhibited had reached an indescribable level.
This was also one of his strongest finishing moves.
“Not good!” The Vajra Holy Monk’s face changed dramatically, a sense of impending death emerging in his heart, “Vajra Immortal, Dragon Slayer Skill!”
His body emitted a golden light and swelled a little, not only activating the Vajra Immortal supreme skill, but also integrating the Vajra realm of comprehension, pushing his defense to the absolute limit..
Simultaneously, he activated another protective skill, which actually evolved a dragon-shaped phantom shadow encircling his body.
North Barbarian’s Iron Battle and Demon Sect’s Yang Kaitai also changed colors in quick succession.
The power exerted by this sword made their hearts tremble.
“Axe Breaks the Wilderness, open for me!” Iron Battle roared, his axe light spanning over thirty meters, and he slashed directly at the oncoming Sword Qi.
Attack against attack.
Yang Kaitai also demonstrated his secret art.
At this moment, these three Great Grandmasters exhibited the extreme limits of their prowess.
Boom…
The void thundered, and Heaven and Earth trembled.
Every strand of Sword Qi was comparable to the strike of a Grandmaster, densely and ceaselessly falling like spring rain or heavy downpour, easily ripping apart Iron Battle’s axe’s light, shattering his treasured axe.
Then, it completely annihilated Iron Battle’s protective Gang Qi.
“How could it be so strong?” Iron Battle cried out in despair.
He was confident about confronting Elder Zhang and even if he was no match, he could hold out for a while, but he couldn’t withstand the attack of the young man in front of him.
How could this be, how could this be!
“I shouldn’t have coveted the Nine Yin and Nine Yang Secret Art for further progress, to suppress Elder Zhang, to become the world’s number one, to establish a lasting foundation for our North Barbarian. I can’t accept this, I can’t accept it…”
Iron Battle roared desperately, and then he suddenly stopped.
His incredibly sturdy body was pierced by tangible Sword Qi into a sieve, instantly resulting in his death.
He was nearly obliterated.
“Greed is a deadly sin. I shouldn’t have believed Monk Puhui’s words, collaborating in secret with the Essence of righteousness and evil, to control the world of martial arts. It’s over, it’s really over!” Yang Kaitai couldn’t hold on much longer, he lamented with a sigh and was slain on the spot.
Ding, ding, ding…
The Vajra Holy Monk held on the longest, but even though he had the strongest defense, he eventually had his defenses broken by the Five Elements Power of the Ten Thousand Swords Return to One Sword Qi, tearing his body apart.
The Sword Qi that penetrated his body, bit by bit destroyed his internal organs. “What are you exactly? A human or ghost? A demon or monster?” The Vajra Holy Monk stood still, and until the Sword Qi dispersed, he hoarsely asked Jiang Ming.
“I’m Immortal!” Jiang Ming coldly replied, “Dalin Temple was a top sect in the world of martial arts, yet why did you get greedy for the Cultivation Skills and Secret Arts in my possession? Huijian was like that, and so are you. Attempting to cultivate Buddhahood, yet you cultivated the greed and desire to kill, losing all sense of right and wrong!”
“The Dynasty is on the verge of collapse, the world is about to be plunged into chaos, and the same is true for the world of martial arts. We must plan for the future. The peerless sutras and unparalleled secret arts in your possession are too numerous, too numerous. These are invaluable for our sects, and if obtained, can ensure our prosperity for a thousand years.” The Vajra Holy Monk, with blood trickling from the corners of his mouth and spurting out from his body, seemed to be unaware of his state, speaking slowly. “Join forces with the Demon Sect and invite the North Barbarian. No matter what upheaval comes in the future, neither in the dynastic court nor in the world of martial arts, our Dalin Temple will be invincible. Alas, alas, you are even stronger than Elder Zhang. This is Heaven wanting to destroy me, wanting to destroy me. Three Great Grandmasters join hands, yet are all killed by you. Ha, ha, ha…”
He then spat out a mouthful of fresh blood mixed with fragments of his internal organs.
Anyone else in this state would have long died.
But he was still holding on.
The incredible vitality moved Jiang Ming greatly.
“It’s not a sin to fight, I’m just too powerful!” Jiang Ming showed a smile, “And there’s another saying, man proposes, but God disposes. One wrong step and the whole game is lost. After today, your Dalin Temple will undoubtedly be obliterated in the future, mark my words.”
“You want to destroy…” The Vajra Holy Monk suddenly widened his eyes, showing a furious expression, and then his vitality rapidly faded, and he fell backwards.
“Of course, 1 will!” Jiang Ming lifted his head, gazing up at the flowing clouds in the sky, he murmured, “Just because you surround me, I can’t counterattack? What kind of logic is that! Sun and Moon Demon Sect, Dalin Temple, North Barbarian, I am coming for all of you. Read thousands of books, travel thousands of miles, and kill for ten thousand miles.”
Bai Yunfei and the others in the distance looked in horror as the land around Jiang Ming turned into ravines, and saw the three Great Grandmasters being killed.
“The three Great Grandmasters were all killed in a single move?” Bai Yunfei was startled, finding it hard to wrap his head around the fact.
Even his Master would not be assured of victory against such a group, let alone killing them, in a single move.
“We witnessed a miracle!” He Qianshan’s mouth dried out, and extreme excitement was written all over his face, “He walks not the path of Ruthless Swordsmanship, nor that of Emotional Sword, not even the Slaughter Sword, how has he become so powerful?”
As he murmured, his eyes were filled with fanaticism.
It seemed that in his dazed state, he saw another path of Swordsmanship.
The few of them started walking towards Jiang Ming.
Jiang Ming nodded to them, turned around to look at the approaching constable Jin, who looked grim and urgently announced even before getting close, “Brother Jiang, something has happened in the Mansion..”


CHAPTER-44
Chapter 44: Chapter 44: The Mastermind, Pacifying Dalin Temple

Tianwu Manor.
Many corpses lay in the courtyard, bloodstained and severely damaged. Additionally, several people who survived were lying on the ground with their limbs and joints removed.
“Fortunately, you were wise enough to have me stay here and guard the place with constable Jin and others. Otherwise, the consequences could have been irreparable.” Lu Yuan finally sighed with relief when he saw Jiang Ming return.
He sensed the great battle happening outside the city.
He wasn’t worried about Jiang Ming’s safety, but regretted missing the chance to witness the once-in-a-lifetime great battle.
“Thank you!” Jiang Ming bowed his hand.
Upon hearing the news from Constable Jin, he rushed back quickly.
“Don’t be so polite with me.” Lu Yuan waved his hand and continued, “I questioned them a bit, and they mostly knew that Zhao Zhengyi’s alliance was coming. After you left, they sneaked in to steal the secret techniques, presumably taking advantage of your absence.”
He paused and pointed to a person who was unconscious: “This is a Grandmaster-level warrior, but neither Constable Jin nor I recognize him. We couldn’t get any useful information from him.”
“A Grandmaster?” Jiang Ming squatted down, woke the man up with a slap, and pressed his fingers between the man’s eyebrows without giving him time to react.
He activated a spiritual secret technique.
The man’s eyes were filled with confusion.
“Who are you?” Jiang Ming asked.
“I am Deng Tao!”
“Which force do you belong to?”
“Shadow Secret Guard!”
“Shadow Secret Guard? Do you belong to the Court?”
“Yes, I currently serve the Crown Prince.”
Upon hearing this, Lu Yuan shuddered, and Constable Jin’s face changed.
What kind of ability was this that could make a Grandmaster answer without hesitation?
However, when they heard the last line, Lu Yuan somewhat understood, while Constable Jin’s face drastically changed.
“Brother Jiang!” Constable Jin whispered.
She knew the severity of the matter, especially involving the Crown Prince.
As for the Shadow Secret Guard, she vaguely heard of them before: they were one of the dark forces of Court. While the Six Gates openly managed the martial world’s conflicts, the Court secretly controlled other forces as well.
Jiang Ming waved his hand and continued to ask, “Why did you come here?”
“To slaughter Jiang Ming’s family and collect the ultimate techniques!”
The atmosphere went silent at these words.
Lan was frightened, her face still showing lingering fear, and she couldn’t help but move closer to Jiang Ming.
Lu Yuan’s pupils shrank, his face filled with rage.
Constable Jin was very surprised, but thought of something, shuddered, and then sighed helplessly.
“Was it you who destroyed Black Wind Village?” Jiang Ming’s expression remained unchanged as he continued to ask.
“Yes!”
“Why?”
“Jiang Ming, who rose to prominence, was too strong. He successively killed four Grandmasters and also the great Grandmaster Xuanming Master. This powerhouse would inevitably cause changes in the situation. Dalin Temple secretly promoted the Demon-slaying campaign to prevent Jiang Ming from fearing Dalin Temple and backing down. They destroyed the Black Wind Village where Jiang Ming had stayed, causing him to go berserk and inevitably fight Dalin Temple, creating turmoil in the martial world.”
“Was it the same intention when you planned to slaughter Tianwu Manor?”
“Yes! In this battle, if Jiang Ming loses, it would be fine since we can take away numerous secret techniques. If Jiang Ming wins and returns after the great battle, seeing his family slaughtered would inevitably drive him to retaliate and overturn the entire martial world.”
“Who ordered this?”
“The Crown Prince!”
“Why didn’t he try to recruit Jiang Ming?”
“Vaguely, I heard that the Crown Prince evaluated that Jiang Ming was righteous, domineering, and unyielding, with no fear of authority. Even if recruited successfully, once he discovered the various evils of the Crown Prince, it would lead to unpredictable consequences. Jiang Ming’s temperament is also a flaw, which is just right for stirring up chaos in the martial world, suppressing dissent, and preparing for future repression.”
“How many strong fighters are there in the Shadow Secret Guard? How many Great Grandmasters and Grandmasters are there in the Royal Family?” Jiang Ming asked again.
As for the Crown Prince, Lu Yuan once said that he was very intelligent and talented, having served as the Crown Prince for more than forty years.
No one knew whether it was because he sat on the Crown Prince’s throne for too long that his nature gradually changed. He became cold, cruel, lascivious, and ruthless. It was even rumored that he secretly built several palaces dedicated to collecting women from all over the world for his amusement.
When he grew tired of the women, he either killed them or sent them to brothels to make money for him.
“The Shadow Secret Guard has four Grandmasters and sixteen Innate masters; within the Royal Family, there are two Great Grandmasters, one is the Old Eunuch, who is being revered; the other is the Royal Family Ancestor, details are unknown. Besides, Wang Wudi of the Six Gates is also at the Great Grandmaster Realm.”
“Does the Crown Prince want to kill his father, the king?”
“I don’t know, but he’s plotting to eliminate several princes who pose threats to him, as well as secretly opposing the Ninth Princess and controlling most of the Court.”
“How interesting!” Jiang Ming asked no further questions and slapped the other dead with one palm strike.
With a casual flick, the remaining survivors were all pierced by Sword Qi and returned to Heaven and Earth on the spot.
“Ji…Jiang Brother!” Constable Jin turned pale and trembled.
Is this something a small Constable Jin Zhang could hear?
God damn it.
About to lose my life.
“Brother Jiang, what should we do in the future?” Constable Jin glanced at the people around her, at this moment, she actually had an impulse to silence them.
Soon, the thought was extinguished.
“Chill out!” Jiang Ming said indifferently, “Constable Jin, you are the Ninth Princess’s person, pass the message to her, don’t die carelessly. Also, ask her to send someone or come here personally to take over this place.”
“Take over here? Brother Jiang, what do you mean?” Constable Jin was puzzled.
Lu Yuan also looked over.
Initially, he was astonished by Jiang Ming’s methods, but afterwards, the secrets he revealed made him scratch his head.
If it were a world of martial arts matter, that would be all.
Now it’s even involving the struggle between the Crown Prince and the other princes, and there might even be the possibility of a rebellion.”
Fucking hell!
His balls are aching.
“Dalin Temple’s Vajra Holy Monk, Demon Sect Leader Yang Kaitai, and the Northern Barbarian Great Grandmaster Iron War have all besieged me, I must take revenge!” Jiang Ming said coldly, “Once things are settled here, I will head to Dalin Temple to see if I can flatten the Gate of the Hill.”
“Brother Jiang, that’s Dalin Temple! It’s ancient and profound, there are Devil Slayer Hand techniques within the temple, which can’t be easily flattened,” Constable Jin hurriedly reminded, her face changed further, and she whispered, “And then what?”
Her voice trembled, her body cold.
Because she realized a possibility.
If he could flatten Dalin Temple, what of the Crown Prince?
“First flatten Dalin Temple, then wipe out the Demon Sect, and finally head to the Imperial Capital, I want to see if the Crown Prince’s head is harder than everyone else’s!” Jiang Ming had no intention of hiding his plans.
Because there was no need.
Constable Jin’s face went numb.
Lu Yuan looked to the heavens, he knew it would be like this, this was the Jiang Ming he knew. However, thinking of the situations that would occur in the future, his scalp tingled even with his debauched nature.
Lan seemed unconcerned.
Just after cleaning up the battlefield, Bai Yunfei and the others who rushed over with the corpses of the three Great Grandmasters froze and wanted to turn and leave.
Flatten Dalin Temple? Annihilate the Demon Sect? Kill the Crown Prince?
What the fuck!
This was no longer a matter of the scalp tingling, instead, they were stirring up the world’s chaos, which all parties could not stay out of if they really occurred.
Trouble came.
Who could stop this guy?
Even after slaying hundreds of experts in the world of martial arts, and killing three Great Grandmasters in a finger snap, not even Elder Zhang could necessarily stop him if he came down the mountain.
“Brother Jiang, I… I must leave first!” Constable Jin had an impulse to flee into the mountains and hide, taking a deep breath, suppressing the trembling of her heart, and left with a fist salute.
She needed to pass on the message.
“Brother Jiang, even if you want to take action, you can’t just not keep it secret. I’m afraid they’ll surround you again before you leave,” Lu Yuan reminded, “By that time, it’ll be even more terrifying, and a large army might even appear!”
“Sigh! 1 boarded your pirate ship, and not only this life but even the next one is doomed,” Lu Yuan sighed again.
Yet his stance was also clear.
“Should we kill to silence them?” He looked at the entrance.
Jiang Ming also looked over.
Outside, Bai Yunfei and the others all turned pale..


CHAPTER-45
Chapter 45: Chapter 45: The Beginning of the Myth

Killing them all is impossible.
However, Bai Yunfei and the others are scared half to death.
Jiang Ming instructed the servants to cooperate with Constable Jin’s men in transporting the corpses and cleaning the courtyard. He then led Bai Yunfei and the others into the living room.
Their gazes towards Jiang Ming were slightly apprehensive, after all, he was a killing god, a true killing god. In just a few months since he had appeared, how many grandmasters had he slain?
There were four Great Grandmasters.
Those were the lofty Great Grandmasters, who hadn’t been killed in decades.
“Brother Jiang, are you really determined to go to Dalin Temple first? You should know that once you make a move, you will face a certain situation,” Lu Yuan said solemnly, “Not to mention the forces within Dalin Temple, there’s the Demon Sect, the North Barbarian, and that one…”
He pointed upwards.
“Furthermore, how many family and sect forces are attached to Dalin Temple? It’s easy for them to gather thousands of skilled martial artists from the world of martial arts.”
“What about other forces? Under the sadness of losing their allies, will they not retaliate?”
“In the worst-case scenario, if a large army is mobilized…”
“Brother Jiang, how will you deal with it? There is a limit to human power, after all. Although your combat power is against the heavens and your Qi is so profound that it makes people despair, you will still be worn down to death!” “Under the siege of a large army, how can you escape if you get entangled? You’ll be consumed to death!”
“You have already killed four Great Grandmasters. Although you were passively dealing with them, from the outsiders’ point of view, this is a performance of wanting to kill the world with bloodshed. If someone raises the flag and calls out, they will respond with great enthusiasm.”
“By that time, you will truly become the enemy of the world.”
Lu Yuan’s expression was extremely solemn.
He still had more to say.
If it really came to that step, even Bai Yunfei and the others present would be implicated, and their sects wouldn’t be able to stay out of the matter, as they were part of the world of martial arts.
Under the general trend, if you don’t act, you will be isolated.
Bai Yunfei and the others watched nervously.
“If you are in this world and have the ability, you can’t always be too wronged,” Jiang Ming laughed. “They are constantly attacking me. If 1 don’t counterattack, this Great Grandmaster title would be too undeserved, and it will be easy for people to take it lightly. People will say, look, he is a Great Grandmaster, yet even after being besieged and killed several times, he doesn’t even dare to let out a fart, what a waste!”
Jiang Ming waved his hand to stop Lu Yuan from continuing to persuade and asked, “Will you go?”
“Go, of course, go!” Knowing that further persuasion was impossible, Lu Yuan did not hesitate and said, “Attack Dalin Temple! How can 1 miss such a scene!” “Good!” Jiang Ming nodded and looked at Bai Yunfei and the others. “After 1 leave, you can enjoy the books at your leisure. I will entrust Ninth Princess to manage it.”
“Thank you, Brother Jiang!” Bai Yunfei was instantly excited.
He knew that the peerless scrolls collected here were no fewer than ten, which was an absolute treasure trove. Even if they could absorb one or two, the benefits would be endless.
“After 1 return, if 1 have some free time, I will rewrite them, record the Nine Yang True Scripture and Nine Yin Divine Art that I have deduced, and make them public, along with several other cultivation skills that are not weaker than the Nine Yin and Nine Yang,” Jiang Ming added.
Hisss…
This time, Bai Yunfei and the others couldn’t help but gasp.
If someone else said this, it would definitely be considered bragging.
Deduced the Nine Yin and Nine Yang?
Bullshit!
Created peerless divine arts on par with the Nine Yin and Nine Yang?
Bloody hell!
But the one who said this was Jiang Ming, who had cut down four Great Grandmasters. It was definitely not fake.
Hisss…
How incredible was this?
“Perhaps, even our master is not his equal!” Such a thought arose in Bai Yunfei’s mind.
Not to mention them, even Lu Yuan, who had long been used to Jiang Ming’s amazing talents, couldn’t help but be shocked.
“Are you planning to popularize martial arts throughout the world?” Lu Yuan licked his lips.
“I have no sect, no family, and have come to this world to draw from the wisdom of the world. I can’t just take without giving back. 1 have to leave something behind,” Jiang Ming said. “Once I return safely from this trip, Brother Bai, I will have to ask for your assistance to help me build a World Martial Hall, collecting the martial arts of the world and publicizing them. With the collective wisdom of mankind, 1 hope to break the shackles of martial arts, break the limits of heaven and earth, and see the scenery above the Great Grandmaster level!”
This ambition made Bai Yunfei and the others pay their respect.
Next, they began to contact some people to come here in advance to prepare.
In a few days, the Ninth Princess arrived.
The bright moon was falling, and the night was vast.
In the courtyard, they sat facing the moon, the fragrance of tea lingering.
“Brother Jiang, now the whole world is talking about you. You’ve defeated hundreds of martial artists, comprehended the Slaughter Sword Intent in battle, killed four Grandmasters with one sword, and destroyed three Great Grandmasters. Such achievements are earth-shattering, unprecedented, and surely no one else will be able to match them in the future.” The Ninth Princess was emotionally moved, looking at Jiang Ming, her beautiful eyes twinkling.
With a more serious expression, she continued, “Are you really going to Dalin Temple?”
“Yes!” Jiang Ming nodded, “i will also go to the Imperial Capital in the future. Will you try to stop me?”
“No!” The Ninth Princess shook her head, even showing a look of intrigue, “If it wasn’t for my unparalleled martial arts talent, being protected by Wang Wudi, and planning for the Six Gates early on, controlling some power, both I and Sixth Imperial Brother would have been harmed by him long ago.”
She did not go into detail but revealed the filth within the royal family.
Jiang Ming knew that the Ninth Princess and the Sixth Prince were siblings.
“However, Brother Jiang…” she hesitated, “If you really go to Dalin Temple, I’m afraid the Divine Fist Sect, Lengyue Palace, and others will not stand by. The world of martial arts is vast, but the first-tier sects have long formed tacit agreements to suppress other forces, including the Zhen Wu Sect.”
“It is certain that the Demon Sect will take action since you killed their leader.”
“The North Barbarian might also send a powerful assassin group.”
“Evil Path Characters will seize the opportunity.”
“If the Crown Prince feels threatened, eight or nine times out of ten, he will send a team to siege and kill. Even a Great Grandmaster would have a hard time escaping.”
“Brother Jiang, think it over carefully!”
The Ninth Princess elaborated more than Lu Yuan did.
Jiang Ming chuckled, picked up the teacup, looked at the bright moon, and said solemnly, “With the court in chaos and the world in turmoil, my departure will inevitably become the center of it all. Ninth Princess, for you, this may be a good opportunity.”
The Ninth Princess’s eyes brightened, and she lowered her voice, “Brother Jiang, how confident are you?”
“When I killed the Vajra Holy Monk and the others, I wasn’t even using half of my combat power!” Jiang Ming replied.
Shh…
The Ninth Princess’s eyes widened in disbelief, and even her calm temperament was thrown into turbulence, as she gazed at Jiang Ming in disbelief.
It took her a long time to regain her calm.
Her eyes were filled with radiance, and unconsciously, she licked her lips, her tongue looking alluringly red. Perceiving Jiang Ming’s glance, she blushed. “Brother Jiang, what do you seek?” Suppressing her emotions, the Ninth Princess asked again.
“The World Collection of Books, the Extreme of Martial Arts, and breaking the Void!”
“I might not be able to help with the others, but the World Collection of Books? Brother Jiang, I will help you!”
“What if I become the enemy of the world?”
“Aren’t you already an enemy of the world now?” The Ninth Princess laughed, “You can travel in peace, and I will provide you with various intelligence along the way.”
She paused, picked up the teacup, took a sip, and whispered, “Brother Jiang, when the world is at peace, can 1 follow you and pursue the ultimate path in martial arts? My martial arts talent is among the top in the world, and I’m not far from the peak of grandmaster.”
She was only twenty-two years old.
Under the night sky, her face was flushed.
The bright moon remained silent.
The next day, Jiang Ming boarded a carriage filled with hundreds of books that he had not yet finished reading. Constable Jin Yinhua took the place of Lan to serve him. In her words: I, a prestigious constable, have actually become a maid! Really went to the dogs!
“I’ve actually become a coachman!” Lu Yuan complained at the front, “Brother Jiang, tell me, am I asking for trouble?”
“There will be great shows to watch along the way, and they will be worth your coachman’s fare.” Jiang Ming laughed in response.
At the back.
“On this journey, the path of the martial world is long, and the world is in chaos.” Bai Yunfei muttered under his breath.
“This departure marks the beginning of a martial arts myth.” The Ninth Princess said, her eyes shining in the distance..


CHAPTER-46
Chapter 46: Chapter Forty-Six: I Want It, I Want It Now

The world of martial arts was in turmoil, stirring in every corner of the world.
Daolin Temple had summoned back all the disciples who were outside and issued a notice to all major sects about the birth of a Demon Head, inviting them to join the demon subjugation.
Many people scoffed at it.
Many secretly considered Daolin Temple to be deviating from the proper path, after all, they had been collaborating with the Mo Teachings and the North Barbarians.
However, most of them kept their attentions on Jiang Ming. Wherever he went, countless eyes were spying on him. From north to south, countless heroes from the world of martial arts were rushing to Daolin Temple, ready to witness a once-in-a-lifetime great war.
Jiang Ming, on the other hand, was not in a hurry. He strolled around leisurely, taking his meals and drinks, enjoying the scenery and local culture, all with great pleasure.
By a poolside, Jiang Ming was sitting cross-legged. A chill spread from him, causing the pool to freeze rapidly, then transform into a fog, condensing water droplets. A downpour fell, forming a perfect cycle.
In the end, it transformed into a stream of water, winding around the surrounding like a Water Dragon Soul, and then it condensed into an ice spear, shot towards the distant rock wall, immediately causing an explosion, stones flying everywhere.
With the swing of his large hand, clouds appeared, swiftly shrouding everything around and rising upward. Then, breezes appeared out of nowhere, gathering momentum, carrying the fog upwards.
Clouds have no form, the wind is shapeless, when wind and cloud merge, thunder roars in the nine heavens.
“Wind is formless, formed by clouds!” Jiang Ming spoke, and the clouds flowed and encircled Lu Yuan, who was already concentrating, learning carefully.
He released the Wind’s Dao Rhyme around him, allowing the other person to understand it thoroughly.
Lu Yuan was already at the peak of a grandmaster, he only lacked the comprehension of the power of realm. However, he had a unique talent in the Light Skill, making it much easier for him to understand the path of the wind. And that was exactly what he was doing during today’s cultivation, which was to enlighten the other person.
However, Jiang Ming was looking forward.
“The realm of water has already achieved great success, and it’s not far from perfection, but the further I comprehend, the harder it is. It seems that there is a certain power in between heaven and earth suppressing it.”
Under normal circumstances, it should not be difficult for him to comprehend to the state of perfection.
In addition to this, Jiang Ming also found that the Qi in the Qi Sea Space in Dantian was difficult to liquefy.
Whether it was the four Grandmasters he had slain, or the information he obtained from Bai Yunfei, it seemed that all the Grandmasters in the world could not liquefy their Qi, perhaps due to the knowledge barrier.
“Perhaps it’s limited by the rules of heaven and earth!”
Jiang Ming stood up, also retracting the diffuse Dao Rhyme.
Since Lu Yuan had already fallen into comprehension, his guidance at this point was no longer necessary.
Stepping on the green grass, looking at the big tree, he was filled with vitality, blending into the vigorous vitality of the natural world surrounding him, the extreme vitality granted to him by the talent “Reincarnation of Nirvana”, made him feel closer to nature.
The whole person seemed to have transformed into a part of the plants in the world. Vaguely, he seemed to hear various subtle sounds of joy.
Unconsciously, he understood the Heart of Vitality.
The realm of wood, perfection.
Crouching down, looking at the frail little grass in front of him and gently touching it, the little grass grew at a speed visible to the naked eye, becoming robust and lush, and also shaking its tender leaves, emitting an extremely subtle life rhythm.
“The power of wood is also the power of vitality!”
Jiang Ming stood up, walked to a dead little tree, touched the rough bark, and a strange power infused into it. One of its branches was beginning to turn green, becoming more and more intense, then sprouted new tender leaves.
The vitality disappeared, and the tender leaves withered.
His breath fluctuated rapidly, sometimes full of vitality and sometimes utterly still.
“The Way of Prosperity and Decay!” Jiang Ming suddenly realized, “I didn’t expect that by casually experimenting with the power of vitality, I would comprehend the Realm of Prosperity and Decay. The birth is prosperity, the death is decay. The way of prosperity and decay is also a part of the Cycle of Life and Death!”
Above Prosperity and Decay come Life and Death, and Reincarnation.
Despite being better enlightened, Jiang Ming couldn’t comprehend the realm of Reincarnation and Life and Death, he couldn’t even get a clue. At this point, he noticed that Lu Yuan’s aura was changing.
An odd aura started to spread and grew rapidly.
Around Lu Yuan, a wind seemed to be birthed, swirling like elves around him. His aura was surging at an unbelievable speed.
“He’s comprehended the Wind’s Intentions. Being baptized by the Dao Resonance of the Wind, his Qi has metamorphosed, his spirit has become more powerful, even his physical body is experiencing a Cleansing Marrow!” Jiang Ming nodded in satisfaction.
The other person’s cultivation talent was absolutely in the top tier.
When they first met at Black Wind Village, Lu Yuan was merely at the mid-stage of the Grandmaster level. Under his guidance, Lu Yuan’s cultivation had risen rapidly. Now, he had been slightly guided, but he has already stepped into the Great Grandmaster Realm.
What a marvel!
“You have actually guided a Great Grandmaster!” Constable Jin, noticing the oddity, was not any ordinary Innate Peak practitioner. Due to his frequent encounters with Jiang Ming, he naturally understood the power of the realm. “Amazing, truly amazing!” Constable Jin whispered in awe. Then, with abeam in his eyes, he looked at Jiang Ming, nervous, and bit his lip. He blinked his eyes, awkwardly twisted his waist, and coyly said, “Brother Jiang, can you guide me a little? 1 don’t need to be a Great Grandmaster. Just help me become a Grandmaster, okay? Is that okay?”
Jiang Ming couldn’t help but to shiver, “Constable Jin, your coquettish demeanor makes me feel like my scalp is all tingly.”
Constable Jin froze, staring at him fiercely before huffing and turning to leave. Tingly scalp?
I finally showed a bit of a gentle woman’s charm, and you don’t appreciate it at all. You’re not a man, you’re just an eunuch, a Chief Eunuch, a dead eunuch!
She kept muttering to herself.
Jiang Ming twitched a smile.
After a long while, Lu Yuan closed his aura and bowed to Jiang Ming: “Thank you, Brother Jiang!”
“Brother Lu, congratulations on joining the ranks of the strongest in the world of martial arts!” Jiang Ming smiled, “How does it feel?”
“It’s great, better than ever. The current me can beat three of my past selves. After I stabilize my cultivation, I can beat five. Once I incorporate the Intention of Wind into my cultivation skills, I can beat ten!” Lu Yuan was radiant with excitement, he reached out and a gust of wind blew into his palm, it was very odd. “The view from the Great Grandmaster Realm is breathtaking. You could never understand this sense of awe in the path of martial arts until you break through, nor how the grandeur of martial arts pales you in comparison. No wonder Brother Jiang, you want to see what’s beyond the realm of a Great Grandmaster, I now have an overwhelming desire to break limits and reach the peak of martial arts.”
“Shall we go ahead together?”
“Together!”
“Brother Lu, let’s get going!”
“Let’s go!”
The three continued their journey.
“I’m a Great Grandmaster and 1 still have to drive a carriage?” Lu Yuan lamented, “Has anyone ever heard of such a pitiful Great Grandmaster? If word got out, would I get laughed to death?”
“If anyone laughs, kill them. No one would dare laugh then.” Jiang Ming gave a serious answer.
“Makes sense!” Lu Yuan nodded in agreement.
Constable Jin on the carriage just curled her lips, then sat aside, holding her chin, without ever blinking her eyes, staring dead at Jiang Ming.
Jiang Ming felt quite uncomfortable being watched and gave in, “I could help you get into the Grandmaster realm, but there will be great side effects, and your future progress will be greatly slowed down. With your talent, you should be able to break through soon and have a firm foundation to boot. Constable Jin, do you really want to?”
“Yes, I do, I want it right now!” Constable Jin was overjoyed, “Who knows what will happen in the future, without power it’s too uncertain. Brother Jiang, you’re so good.”
“Come on, I’m ready, hurry up!”
She couldn’t wait any longer..


CHAPTER-47
Chapter 47: Chapter 47: When I Want You Dead, You Must Die.

Jiang Ming used his thin Qi and meticulous mental control to help Constable Jin transform his Qi and enter the Master-level Realm.
Throughout the journey, Constable Jin took great care of Jiang Ming, attending to his every need and making him comfortable.
Although they took many stops along the way, they eventually reached the territory of Dalin Temple.
“Brother Jiang, are you really going up the mountain?” Inside the carriage, Constable Jin massaged his leg, looking like a little girl in anyway he could.
“We’ve come this far; of course, we’re going up the mountain.” Jiang Ming held a book, thoroughly enjoying it. “Any recent developments?”
They had been traveling for two months.
“There’s quite a bit!” Constable Jin had received quite a few messages along the way.
For example, around Dalin Temple, there were no fewer than a thousand martial artists gathered, with perhaps even more hidden from view.
Divine Fist Sect, Lengyue Palace, Divine Sword Villa, and so on had all sent people over.
The nearby stationed army also seemed to be taking some sort of action.
A powerful North Barbarian had entered Great Yan Nation but left no trace behind.
Although the Demon Sect members were well-hidden, some clues could still be found.
Dalin Temple was under martial law.
The Six Gates had also dispatched constables.
And so on.
Outside, hidden currents were raging.
The carriage suddenly stopped, and Lu Yuan’s voice rang out: “Nangong Haoran, Brother Nangong, what do you mean by blocking our way?”
“Brother Lu!” Nangong Haoran, clad in white, carrying a long sword, tall, and with an icy aura, said, “I kindly ask you to turn back. The world of martial arts is already chaotic enough. If you continue up the mountain, 1 fear it will trigger a fight that will involve the entire world of martial arts. When that time comes, countless innocent people will be implicated, with no regard for their lives. How can you bear it in your heart?”
“Brother Nangong, they say you are full of righteous indignation and love getting involved in the world’s injustices. Do you find this unbearable?” Lu Yuan sneered. “When Brother Jiang was besieged in Mount Dependence City, why didn’t 1 see you speak up? The second time, Zhao Zhengyi initiated another attack on Brother Jiang, and three Great Grandmasters stepped in, yet we still did not see you. If you could not intervene the first time, that would be fine, but what about the second time?”
“As for triggering a fight in the world of martial arts and implicating the common people, that’s even more outrageous.”
“The Vajra Holy Monk colluded with the Demon Sect and the North Barbarians. What do you think that represents? It means that Dalin Temple wants to rebel, which will cause countless innocent people to die miserably.”
“Nangong, 1 never would have thought that you, who always act impartially, upright, and solely focus on sword skills, would sell your life for Dalin Temple.”
Lu Yuan sighed.
Jiang Ming also got off.
Constable Jin followed.
“So you’re Jiang Ming?” Nangong Haoran’s gaze passed over Lu Yuan, and he looked at Jiang Ming. The long sword on his back buzzed and vibrated, then jumped out, drawing a streak of light before landing in his hand.
He flicked it into the air, and Sword Qi sprayed out, its powerful aura soaring into the sky.
“Rumor has it that you killed Xuanming Master first, then killed three Great Grandmasters with a single sword. I don’t believe it!” Nangong Haoran stepped forward. “I consider myself unparalleled in sword skills, and the only one who can compare with me is the Sword God He Yiming of Divine Sword Villa. As for you? I want to see if you’re as strong as the rumors say.”
Jiang Ming laughed.
Lu Yuan quickly jumped off the carriage, stood between the two, and said to Jiang Ming with a clasped fist, “How about I take care of this, Brother Jiang?” “Fine!” Seeing his serious expression, Jiang Ming nodded.
Lu Yuan breathed a sigh of relief.
He knew that if Jiang Ming took action, Nangong Haoran would undoubtedly die. Turning around, he looked at Nangong Haoran with helplessness, “Why did you have to step into this muddy water?”
Nangong Haoran remained silent.
“The Nangong Family has great influence. Maybe…” Lu Yuan didn’t finish his sentence but instead said, “I will fight on behalf of Brother Jiang. Brother Nangong, make your move!”
“Brother Lu, I appreciate your kindness, but please step aside; you are not my opponent.” Nangong Haoran said, “1 am already at the peak of the Master-level, but I still cannot comprehend Sword Intention, and I cannot progress any further. Now that I have encountered a peerless sword master, how can I give up!”
“Haven’t you heard that one should take a fresh look at someone they haven’t seen for three days? The me today is not the same as the me in the past!”
“Brother Lu, it’s not that I look down on you, but apart from being able to run, you have no special skills at all!”
“Brother Nangong, am I truly that bad?” Lu Yuan raised an eyebrow, his face turning slightly unpleasant.
At the very least, he used to be a powerful Master-level martial artist!
Was he really good for nothing except running?
Who was he looking down on!
He thought of the time when he was called ‘Lu Paopao’ in Black Wind Village and couldn’t help but grind his teeth.
“Brother Nangong, other than your sword, you’re good for nothing. However, from now on, apart from Brother Jiang, who in the world can make me run?” Lu Yuan raised his hand for a Shaoze Sword thrust.
Buzz…
Sword qi pierced the air, containing the Wind’s Intentions, reaching the ultimate speed. In a blink, it was close to Nangong Haoran, who was alarmed. He immediately blocked it with his long sword, but the force pushed him back five or six steps.
Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh…
Lu Yuan continued to wield sword qi, forcing Nangong Haoran to retreat more than fifty meters away.
With his footing in disarray and his face flushed.
Lu Yuan finally stopped and said with a sly grin, “Brother Nangong, you see, I’m truly good for nothing, except defeating you with my sword techniques.” “This is not a sword skill!” Nangong Haoran’s defiant lips trembled as he turned to leave, quietly saying, “Thank you!”
“From now on, I am just a wandering swordsman!”
Nangong Haoran used his Light Skill and quickly left.
“In the world of martial arts, one can’t help but be bound,” Lu Yuan sighed inexplicably, then said, “Are we still going to sit?”
“I’m tired of sitting; let’s walk up the mountain!” Jiang Ming walked forward with his hands behind his back.
“Walking up the mountain is better than riding a carriage, huh?” Lu Yuan snorted and quickly followed.
Constable Jin remained silent and followed as well.
Behind them, there were constables from the Six Gates to take care of the carriage.
There were people watching on both sides, waiting to see what would happen.
Lu Yuan kept greeting them.
At the base of the mountain.
Their path was blocked.
“Amitabha Buddha, may 1 know the reason for Master Jiang’s visit to our humble temple?” A wrinkled-faced old monk stood before them, surrounded by a strong aura of death qi, but with bright eyes.
Thirty-six strong monks stood around him, each holding a steel rod as thick as a goose egg and staring at Jiang Ming fiercely.
“To annihilate!” Jiang Ming spat out these two words and waved his hand.
Lu Yuan opened his mouth to say something but chose to step aside instead.
Constable Jin didn’t say anything either, only looking at the old monk with some pity.
“Amitabha Buddha, the Vajra monks acted on their own, and their actions don’t represent our Dalin Temple. Master Jiang, seeking revenge for a single injustice only invites others to seek revenge against you. Why not just leave?” The old monk frowned, suppressing the anger in his heart.
“I also act on a personal basis!” Jiang Ming couldn’t help but laugh, “Dalin Temple still looks down on me. If you truly wanted to apologize, you should have shown sincerity from the start, at least bowing three times. But now, you send a dying man to greet me. Isn’t it obvious that you want to confront me, kill me if you can, or at least test my strength?”
“I should have killed more.”
“Three Great Grandmasters can’t force your arrogant heads, which only serve Buddha, to bow.”
“Fine, today I will send you all to see the Buddha Master.”
Jiang Ming saw through Dalin Temple’s intentions.
“Master Jiang, you will go to hell!” The old monk laughed and shouted, “Tathagata Demon Subduing Array, suppress this demon for me!”
Buzz…
His body swelled, and a violent aura stirred up a raging torrent. His strength even surged to the Great Grandmaster Realm.
Blood flowed from the corners of his mouth.
The thirty-six rod monks instantly shifted positions, surrounded Jiang Ming, and directly attacked with their rods powered by their qi.
They were all Innate experts.
The shadows of their rods roared, blocking out the sky.
“Now it’s interesting! Say you’re going to attack and then do it. Be ruthless; don’t stop until you kill!” Jiang Ming laughed, “It’s rare to have a perfect solution in the world. I want you dead, so you have to die!”
With a grasp, qi formed into a sword..


CHAPTER-48
Chapter 48: Chapter Forty-eight: Sword Destruction,
Three-fold Cause and Effect, Three Conditions

Rod shadows covered the sky, but were artfully arranged, stirring up a primordial qi storm, blocking all escape routes. With one blow, gods and demons would find it hard to avoid.
At this moment, the old monk in front also made his move.
“Devil Slayer Palm!” His full power surged out and turned into a palm print that struck Jiang Ming’s chest. Not only did it not destroy the Dao Resonance of the rod shadows, but it made the attack even more terrifying.
Jiang Ming condensed his qi into a sword, drew a line in the sky, and unleashed a torrent of murderous aura that cut through the sky of rod shadows. As the power vibrated, he sent everyone flying away.
“Impossible!” The old monk was also blown away, spitting out a mouthful of blood. He looked at the sword mark on his chest that almost cut him in half, his face extremely pale.
“The Tathagata Demon Subduing Array, combined with my secret skill-enhanced blow, is difficult even for a Great Grandmaster to resist, but you managed to break it with a casual strike and heavily injured me,” he said, as if he had seen a ghost.
Jiang Ming did not respond. His long sword shattered with a bang. With a wave of his hand, it transformed into the fastest and sharpest flying blades that went straight for everyone’s brows.
Even the old monk in front couldn’t dodge it. His brow was pierced through, and with his eyes wide open and staring at Jiang Ming, he fell to the ground and died with a twitch of his lips.
Jiang Ming looked up at the sky, flicked his clothes, stepped on the stairway, and walked up.
Countless onlookers were already stupefied.
“The formation composed of thirty-six Innate Monks can contend with a Great Grandmaster, but it was broken with a single sword. Am I seeing things, or am I dreaming? Even if he is strong, it shouldn’t be to this extent, right?”
“So strong that it’s terrifying, so strong that it makes people’s hearts tremble.”
“Do any of you know that old monk in front? If you do, you’ll find this even more horrifying. He is Master Guangfa, a highly respected figure. Although not at the Great Grandmaster Realm, he is one of the most top-tier Grandmasters. After using his secret skill, he should be able to hold his own against a Great Grandmaster for a short time, but even that, combined with the rod formation, was defeated and killed by a casual strike.”
“Watching this makes my blood boil.”
“Not just boiling, but completely overwhelmed!”
After a moment of silence, there was an endless cry of astonishment.
Those who came to watch were all powerful individuals.
This kind of slaughter scene, with inhuman combat power and extremely fast-paced battles, was incredibly unbelievable.
Even Lu Yuan felt the same way. He sighed, “I thought that after breaking through, my strength would be close to his, but now it seems that the gap is getting bigger and bigger. With a casual strike, he has unmatched power, like a martial god descending to earth, the son of heaven himself.”
“Yes,” constable Jin pursed her lips, her eyes slightly hazy. “This thigh is so thick.”
“You should know the exact thickness of his thigh,” Lu Yuan said weirdly.
Jin gave him a sidelong glance and quickly caught up.
“Brother Jiang has gained another little fan!” Lu Yuan pinched his chin. “Lan is one, Ninth Princess’s eyes are also different when looking at him. That Tian Zhi Jiaozi, a peerless talented beauty whose martial art talent is even stronger than mine, was tamed after just a few encounters, and he doesn’t even know it. And there’s this little chili pepper, who is set on becoming a constable – her heart must have been branded by Brother Jiang’s image.”
“I’m jealous, so jealous. Why isn’t there at least one of these stunning genius women who would fall for me? What if I show off my Great Grandmaster charisma later on? Will there be any beautiful women taking the initiative to approach? There must be, definitely not just one, should say countless.”
Lu Yuan couldn’t help but laugh when he thought of the wonderful idea. He took a step forward, covering more than ten meters, and quickly caught up. The other powerful individuals also hurriedly ascended the stairs.
Cloud Mountain was where Dalin Temple was located, surrounded by clouds and fog, with sandalwood lingering in the air and the sound of bells faintly discernible. It had an atmosphere of harmony.
Several great monks were leaning over the railing, watching intently.
Seeing the rod formation broken, and Master Guangfa and others killed, they couldn’t help but bow their heads and chant, “Amitabha Buddha.”
“Abbot, the demon head is too strong. What should we do?”
The other monks all looked at the monk in the middle, who happened to be the abbot of Dalin Temple, Master Pudu. His bald head gleamed, a white beard fluttered on his chest, and he held prayer beads in his hand, counting them one by one, reciting indecipherable scriptures.
Abbot Pudu paused for a moment.
“Amitabha Buddha, it is not that he is too strong, but that he is beyond imagination,” he said in a low voice, continuing to turn the prayer beads. “Our previous arrangements will not work anymore. To suppress this demon, we must put aside all calculations and unite all parties. Apprentice Brother Puguang, Apprentice Brother Pufa, you two will lead them all to the temple at Baiyun Platform, where we will subdue the demon.”
“All my fellow apprentice brothers and sisters have already analyzed Jiang Ming’s character. He is vengeful, ruthless in his actions, and doesn’t leave any survivors once he attacks. Don’t hold any lucky thoughts.”
“He’s walking very slowly on his way here, building momentum and accumulating power. He’s coming with the intention of destroying our sect.”
“If we don’t win this battle, our millennia of foundation will be destroyed in an instant, and we will be too ashamed to face the Buddha Master.”
“If we don’t win, we die!”
“If we don’t win, we are the sinners of our sect.”
“Exhaust everything, kill this demon!”
Abbot Pudu leaped forward.
Everyone else followed closely.
Stepping on the stairs, passing the pavilion and the viewing platform, to Jiang Ming’s surprise, there was no obstruction at all.
In the end, he saw a huge platform in front of him. On one side was a large bell being struck by a monk, making a deep, resonant sound.
In the center of the ground were nine huge tripods arranged in a line, each with a thick incense stick as thick as a child’s arm. The smoke rose like pillars, reaching high into the sky.
Surrounded by monks armed with steel rods, glaring at him in anger, they hated that they could not rush up to eat his flesh and drink his blood.
There was a row of big monks right in front of him.
Further behind was an extremely imposing great hall, filled with many novices sitting and reciting the Demon Slayer scriptures.
Jiang Ming finally stopped in front of them.
After a glance, his heart trembled.
“It’s no wonder that Dalin Temple is a thousand-year-old temple. This foundation, in the whole world, I’m afraid no sect can match!” Jiang Ming admired.
All the surrounding rod monks were in the Innate Realm.
It’s really incredible.
Apart from this, there were twelve Grandmaster-level strong men and two Great Grandmasters.
This was the accumulation of Dalin Temple.
Just by looking at this display, Jiang Ming understood that they were going all out to fight him and annihilate him.
At the same time, he also sensed that there were many powerful people hidden inside the great hall, with auras clearly different from the Dalin Temple monks.
Sun and Moon Demon Sect? North Barbarian? Crown Prince’s men? Invited strong people from other forces?
It didn’t matter anyway.
“Amitabha Buddha, 1 am Abbot Pudu. Pleased to meet you,” Abbot Pudu walked up and chanted a Buddha’s name. He said seriously, “Master Jiang, the past is like smoke in the wind, drifting away without a trace. Can we turn the page on our past? Cause and effect, right and wrong, are nothing but illusions. Master Jiang, you can mention your conditions!”
“Forget the past? You make it sound easy!” Jiang Ming smiled and said, “I have three conditions. If you agree, we can let bygones be bygones!”
“Please explain!” Abbot Pudu was slightly surprised, but if they could avoid fighting, he really didn’t want to take action.
In the past, Jiang Ming’s battle record was only hearsay, but the battle at the base of the mountain made him see Jiang Ming’s true terror.
He was simply not human.
“I have no connection with your Dalin Temple, but outside Mount Dependence City, your disciple Huijian attacked me. Although he is dead, this is your cause and effect; it was also outside Mount Dependence City, Vajra Monk tried to encircle and kill me, this is the second causal connection; at the foot of the mountain, aside from not apologizing, you clearly want to take action against me for the third time, this again is a causal connection.”+ament+”” +”My life is very valuable, you tried to kill me three times. I only want three conditions for you to resolve our cause and effect.”+ament+”
Even with Abbot Pudu’s state of mind, he couldn’t help but twitch the corner of his mouth at this explanation.
Although they tried to kill him, what was the result?
All were killed by him.
Now he has come to kill at the gate of the temple, who can I appeal to?
He could only suppress the anger in his heart.
Jiang Ming raised a finger, and his voice carried far away: “The first condition: I want all the scriptures of your Dalin Temple.”
Abbot Pudu’s expression slightly stiffened..


CHAPTER-49
Chapter 49: Chapter 49: Nine Yang Merging into One

The Sutras, all the Sutras?
This is their foundation, their accumulation, and the true confidence of the thousand-year-old temple. Would they really give them all?
Even Master Pudu, with his state of mind, almost cursed.
The surrounding monks all glared, their killing intent boiling.
Jiang Ming’s expression was indifferent, surrounded by a killing aura, simply staring at the abbot.
“Okay!” Master Pudu pondered and reluctantly nodded, “Jiang Donor, please state the remaining two conditions.”
Second!” Jiang Ming revealed a smile, “Have one of the Great Grandmasters of your Great Dalin Temple pass away; third, exterminate the Sun and Moon Demon Sect.”
Master Pudu’s face suddenly turned ugly, his little compassion turning completely cold: “You’re not leaving my Dalin Temple any way out, Jiang Donor. Do you really think that by yourself, you can withstand the thousand years of accumulation of my Great Dalin Temple? Do you really think that your overwhelming power allows you to ignore everything?”
“Set the formation, subdue the demon!” Master Pudu’s voiced resonated like a ringing bronze bell, reverberating through the mountains, “The world has a great demon descending, bringing a calamity that will harm the common people and cause bloodshed for miles. We need to unite, subdue the demon, eliminate the monster, save the world from danger, and resolve the crisis hanging over it.”
The surrounding Rod Monks moved like shadows, displaying their lightness skills, surrounding Jiang Ming in the blink of an eye. They were well-aligned, their auras blending with each other and fusing with heaven and earth, causing changes in the tide of primal qi and forming a unique realm.
They all wore devouring gazes.
Slap, slap, slap…
Jiang Ming clapped his hands and praised, “As expected of the Abbot of Great Dalin Temple, the skill of blooming a lotus with your tongue and expelling fragrance is truly unmatched by ordinary people. Your Great Dalin Temple does not labor, yet your palaces are splendid and enchanting. 1 heard that every Buddha statue enshrined in each palace is made of gold. The fields of the people within a hundred miles of Great Dalin Temple have been cunningly snatched away and suppressed by you, enslaving the common people. Even the imperial laws do not reach here. Master Pudu, you tell me, who is the real demon?”
Master Pudu’s gaze was deep, staring at Jiang Ming with an unwavering expression, “Our Great Dalin Temple protects the surrounding people from disaster and teaches them the methods of strengthening their bodies and living a long life. Which of the households here does not remember the kindness of our Great Dalin Temple? In your mouth, however, it becomes a sin. A demon is a demon. No matter how much you quibble, it cannot change the nature of evil!”
“Everyone…” His voice suddenly rose again, shaking the mountains as birds flew and beasts roared, “To subdue the great demon, to restore the world’s order and peace, my Great Dalin Temple is willing to sacrifice our bodies to feed the demon, dedicating all temple disciples to hunt it down. Even if the Gate of the hill topples, even if a thousand disciples have drained their last drop of blood, even if the millennium tradition has been cut off, my Great Dalin Temple will fight the great demon. 1 ask Zhen Wu Sect, Chunyang Sect, Lengyue Palace, Divine Sword Villa, Sun and Moon Demon Sect, Divine Fist Sect, and the Northern Strong Expert to put aside their grievances and unite to eliminate the demon. My Great Dalin Temple will take the lead, and I ask my fellow daoists to help us, to restore the world’s balance and bring eternal peace to the world of martial arts.”
“Kill!” He waved his hand towards Jiang Ming.
The Rod Monks in the formation erupted with their attack.
Shadows of rods filled the sky, converging like the arrival of wind and thunder, twisting the air and shaking heaven and earth.
This made the onlookers all shocked.
“This attack can easily blast a master-class peak strong expert!” Lu Yuan felt it very clearly, his eyebrows furrowing.
He didn’t understand why Jiang Ming proposed three conditions that the Great Dalin Temple could never agree to, nor did he understand why, if he wanted to kill them, he let them set up the formation?
Wasn’t this seeking trouble?
Jiang Ming remained unmoved, merely watching as Master Pudu showed an astonished expression, as if he had truly become the great demon head that would bring about the end of the world.
He was utterly cast into the abyss in the name of righteousness.
In order to defeat the demon, for the greater good, for the human world, he cleverly connected all the strong experts. Even if the people from the demonic sect appeared, even if the Northern strong experts took action, they now had an excuse.
It would not allow the reputation of Dalin Temple to continue deteriorating.
At the same time, it also held the righteous path hostage: In the name of justice, do you dare not to act?”
“I’ve witnessed the power of blooming lotuses with your tongue, Jiang is impressed!”
Exclaiming, the Yin-Yang Tai Chi diagram appeared, forming a light shield that rotated and blocked the countless shadows of rods.
Bang…
The Tai Chi Light Shield trembled three times, twisted to the extreme, and finally broke with a snap.
“Without comprehending the Yin and Yang Realm, there’s still a big difference.” Jiang Ming frowned. In the next moment, the light shield reappeared.
This time it spun even faster.
It even truly showed two colors, one red and one white.
Red was hot and white was cold.
This was the intertwining of the Fire Realm and the Water Realm, a compromise.
The shadows of the rods didn’t stop, the explosions continued.
The light shield continued to shatter, but the attack couldn’t reach him.
This scene shocked all the onlookers.
Master Pudu’s expression changed and changed again. He knew better than anyone how terrifying the rod formation composed of more than a hundred martial monks was.
A Great Grandmaster trapped inside could be killed.
But now they couldn’t completely break the opponent’s defense?
He felt an unreal sensation.
“Battling to comprehend the Dao? We’ll tire you to death!” Master Pudu saw through Jiang Ming’s intention and a hint of fierceness flashed through his eyes.
Jiang Ming was indeed battling to comprehend the Dao.
The realm of Yin and Yang is too difficult to comprehend.
“To evolve further with water and fire, why does it feel even harder? Have I taken the wrong path?”
Jiang Ming couldn’t hold back his power.
In the end, he shook his head and sighed, “I was too arrogant, wanting to comprehend the realm of Yin and Yang all at once.”
“Also, the restrictions in this world are too great, there is no guidance from a towering figure, let alone interpretations from a higher realm!”
Jiang Ming suppressed the waves in his heart, and the light shield shattered with a loud bang.
Intense qi surged through his body, including the qi of Chunyang, Haoyang, Chuyang, Lieyang, and Jiaoyang.
Clang…
The long sword emerged, and qi immediately flowed along it, transforming into a fiery red color, like burning flames, as intense as the scorching sun.
Within the red, several similar but distinct Dao resonances were hidden, and then with a ‘boom’, the sword burst into flames.
A sword swept across the sky, cutting through the endless rod shadows.
“The power of nine true meanings!” An old monk beside Master Pudu exclaimed in horror, his pupils shrinking to the size of a needle tip, “Chuyang, Lesser Yang, Old Yang, Jiaoyang, Lieyang, Haoyang, Supreme Yang, Sun, Chunyang?”
He was Elder Monk Guangming, knowledgeable and well-informed. Although he was not sure about some specific realms, he immediately made a judgment based on the information he had obtained.
“You’ve actually comprehended all the ultimate realms contained in the Nine Yang True Scripture, how is that possible?”
“flow can there be such a monster in this world!”
Guangming was disheveled.
“Nine Yang Realms?” Master Pudu was horrified, and his eyes immediately turned red as he roared, “Attack, attack, use the Blood Sacrifice Demon Subjugation Array to kill him!”
Nine kinds of Yang Realms.
It was chilling to listen to them.
The key was that this guy seemed to be still comprehending them, and if all nine kinds of Yang were combined…
Master Pudu couldn’t help but shudder.
He also immediately issued an order.
All one hundred and eight rod monks slapped themselves on their bodies, and their faces suddenly flushed red. Their qi did not decrease, but instead, surged dramatically.
Almost doubling their power, all reaching the threshold of grandmasters.
Thirty-six of them soared into the air to attack from above.
The seventy-two rod monks on the ground sealed off the surroundings.
Rod shadows layered and intertwined, enveloping the entire area, making it impossible to distinguish between them.
However, the power fluctuations they contained made the spectators tremble in shock.
With this attack, even a mountain peak could be blasted.
Jiang Ming also revealed a solemn expression.
“This is more like it!” One of the goals of his trip was to use the power of Dalin Temple to hone himself.
It was impossible to comprehend Yin and Yang.
So, he tried to start with Yang.
If the nine kinds of Yang realms were merged, would the realm of Yang be born?
This was his idea.
Raising his head, he could not see sunlight or the sky, only the tide-like rod shadows.
The surrounding air had become unbearably viscous due to the pressure.
“Finally, I feel the pressure!” Jiang Ming’s eyebrows perked up, and his long sword buzzed, traversing the sky.
As the sword swung, flames surged, creating a sea of fire that enveloped the rod shadows from bottom to top.
Both forces intertwined and continuously collided.
Finally, the rod shadows exploded, and one hundred and eight martial monks were all sent flying out.
At the same time, two old monks suddenly made their moves with extraordinary agility, like ghosts, appearing on the left and right of Jiang Ming just as his sword light had just converged.
It was completely unexpected.
One pointed at his brow, while the other palm struck his back..


CHAPTER-50
Chapter 50: Chapter 50: All things perish and are buried in Heaven and Earth

With one sword, many martial monks were sent flying. When the sword light convergedf it was precisely when the old strength was exhausted and the new strength had not been born. The two powerful men attacked and killed each other in the midst of this gap.
The timing was very well-mastered.
What’s even more terrifying is that they were both Great Grandmasters.
However, Jiang Ming remained calm, the sword light rose again, leaving endless afterimages. His sword tip seemed to appear simultaneously under the fingers in front and in front of the palm behind, forcing the two powerful men to suddenly retreat.
But at this time, four martial artists attacked from all around at the same time, their breath erupting, ail with the power to destroy mountains and rivers. Even on the top of their heads, two more appeared, a knife and a sword coming down from the sky.
From all directions, high in the sky they fought.
Jiang Ming was completely locked in.
“Six peak Grandmasters!” Jiang Ming’s eyes condensed, his long sword swirling, and the Slaughter Sword Intent burst forth, in an instant, the dense sword qi forced everyone back.
Even the two Great Grandmasters who attacked again were forced to retreat.
The chaotic sword qi instantly killed dozens of the rod monks on the spot. Compared to the battle with the Vajra Holy Monk, his Slaughter Sword Intent had increased several times, and the cold killing intent could freeze the hearts and minds of innate martial artists.
The many powerful people attacking him paused for a moment, all showing shock and fear.
After the Rod Formation attack, two Great Grandmasters attacked, followed by a joint attack by six peak Grandmasters, and they were all forced to retreat?
It was unbelievable.
How strong exactly was he?
This was the thought that crossed everyone’s mind.
“Hahaha!” Jiang Ming laughed loudly, full of confidence, turning his sword upside down into its sheath, shaking both arms and shouting, “This is more like it, come on, let me kill you all!”
Blood boiling, fighting spirit soaring.
This battle truly aroused his interest, so he didn’t plan to use weapons.
He was ready to kill the enemy with his fists.
“Guangming Monk, I’ll kill you first!” Jiang Ming roared as he attacked.
The fists wrapped in extremely thick Air of Gang turned red in an instant, as the friction with the air directly ignited flames. The overwhelming Lieyang power was also added to it.
The air was pierced through.
In an instant, the surrounding temperature increased by more than twenty degrees.
Especially for those watching, they seemed to see a scorching sun rising behind him, hanging high overhead, its might reaching the sky, making people afraid to look directly at it.
“Big Demon Head, I will deliver you today!” Guangming Monk shouted angrily. He sprayed out rays of golden light from his body, intertwined outside, and provoked the primal qi tide. With both hands clappingout, dense palms appeared around him, swarming down and killing everything.
This was the Thousand-Hand Tathagata Palm.
Each palm print contained a suppressing breath, but it was broken by Jiang Ming’s fist. The vortex formed by the air currents shattered all the palm prints. The fists did not stop.
Guangming Monk’s face changed again, and he once again threw out the Devil Slayer Hand, but it couldn’t stop Jiang Ming’s advance.
At the same time, the attacks of other powerful people had arrived.
Jiang Ming didn’t care at all.
The Yin-Yang Tai Chi diagram was woven from the Air of Gang within his body, unloading all the attacking power.
“Initial Yang, Two Yang Dragons, Three Yang Open!”
Jiang Ming threw out three consecutive punches, twisting the air, as if the space was being broken through.
His blood surged, and his blood qi reached the sky.
Boom, boom, boom…
Under the three punches, even with other martial artists blocking, Guangming Holy Monk was blasted away, blood splattering the sky. If he had faced Jiang Ming alone, he would have definitely been blown up.
“Quickly retreat!” Master Pudu shouted, then roared, “Demon-subduing Circle, suppress!”
Before Jiang Ming could chase after him, whip shadows came from the sky and struck him. At the same time, they also formed whirlpools, causing his figure to stagnate as if he had fallen into a quagmire.
Many powerful people attacked him again.
Guangming Holy Monk also wanted to retreat completely.
“Trying to stop me?” Jiang Ming revealed his madness, howling, “still not enough!”
“Four Yangs in rhe Sky, Five Yang Yao World, Six Yang Burning Mountain, open forme!”
Boom, boom, boom…
One after another, the three punches shattered the power of the
Demon-subduing Circle, and the people who had surrounded him were once again blasted away. A Grandmaster-class peak martial artist among them couldn’t withstand the force, his body exploding on the spot.
“Meteor Step, Wind Riding!”
Jiang Ming moved his feet and soared into the air as if he were a golden eagle, flying through the void, his speed reaching the Extreme. He pursued Guangming Holy Monk.
“Seven Yang Boiling Sea, Eight Yang Wusheng, Nine Yang Destruction!”
Jiang Ming howled, pushing his power to the extreme.
The blazing energy made the air boil, and the power of Nine Yang’s realm raised the surrounding temperature again, rising and twisting; he struck out three punches in succession, terror reaching its peak.
The breath of destruction made even Lu Yuan, who was watching, shudder.
From more than ten meters away, the Guangming Holy Monk suddenly felt his heart palpitate, and the sensation of death made him realize something.
There is no escape.
It’s unstoppable.
This attack is lethal.
“Then die!” The Guangming Holy Monk’s face twisted, and he suddenly spun around, confronting Jiang Ming. With hands clasped together, he paid a homage in front of him. At this moment, he seemed incredibly devout, with an endless brilliance of faith, “I pay homage to the Buddha!”
His clasped hands with fingertips pointed at Jiang Ming’s forehead.
His strength was suddenly drained away, and a golden light flew from his fingertips, condensing the supreme power of Gang Qi, accompanied by a faint spiritual fluctuation.
Boom…
Under Jiang Ming’s fist, the Guangming Floly Monk s body instantly exploded. “Amitabha Buddha!” Master Pudu cried out in grief, then roared, “This demon has been marked by the Guangming Holy Monk with the death-light of a supreme divineWact. He is now in a state of spiritual vulnerability. Everyone, life and death hang in the balance of this one strike, make a move, make a move, everyone make a move!”
He was furious to the extreme, his voice hoarse.
At this moment, the numerous hidden powerful fighters rushed over, all launching their most potent attacks at Jiang Ming.
Witnessing his terror and having the opportunity to kill him, how could they not go all-out?
A Grandmaster says to kill, and that’s it.
Is this human power?
Even Elder Zhang would have to retreat when he saw it.
They were too formidable, too powerful, making people despair, no one wants to live under a looming existence like that. Like Dalin Temple, who dared to come alone, the Guangming Holy Monk had no choice but to resort to such a forbidden skill of death.
Too terrifying.
Boom, boom!
The sky exploded, the mountain peaks crumbled.
The thousand-year-old temple’s peak could not withstand the power of so many formidable opponents.
More than thirty maartial artists of Grandmaster level and above unleashed their powers in unison at this moment; their combined strike even Elder Zhang could kill without difficulty.
No one in the world could withstand it.
“To comprehend the subtleties of the spirit, and integrate the power of Gang Qi, this attack’s might reached an immeasurable level. Not only is it a thousand-year-old temple, but its profound foundation also leaves people in awe. If other Grandmasters were faced with this, they might really be defeated, but alas, it is a pity that they encountered me!” Jiang Ming’s voice was very fast, echoing throughout the surroundings.
That last attack didn’t even affect his state of mind in the slightest.
Not to mention his supreme gift of the Soul Dominator, even the Dao Resonance baptism of the dozens of realms he comprehended was enough to temper his spiritual will beyond the imagination of ordinary people.
As he stared at the palm shadows, sword Qi, knife lights and other mighty attacks coming from all directions, he felt considerable pressure.
“If I don’t resist, even though my flesh is very strong, 1 might still be seriously injured, or even lulled… No, there’s an 80-90% chance that I wouldn’t die!” Jiang Ming shifted his thoughts slightly, and the boiling Qi of the nine realms of Intention began to merge. As his body spun, he also struck out a punch in each of the four directions.
“Nine Yangs Unite to Bury Heaven and Earth!”
Darkness loomed over the world as he punched, causing chaos throughout eternity..

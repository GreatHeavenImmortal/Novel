1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Alright, now it's time for an exercise.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So in our project, open up the Mocking folder and look at

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
VideoService class. What I want you to do

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
is write the required unit tests for this method. Get

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
UnprocessedVideosAsCsv. Let's see what's happening

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
here. First, we're creating an empty list, then we're

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
using this VideoContext object, which is part of editing

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
framework. We use this to read data from a database.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So here we have a quarry, we're getting the list of videos that are not quite

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
processed. So each video has this property, IsProcessed, it's

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
boolean, we're simply recording the videos that are not processed.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Then, we iterate over them, and for each video

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
we get it's ID and add it to our list.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And finally, we join all these ID's, using a comma

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and return them as a string. So as you can see,

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
this method is very similar to what you see in a lot of real world applications.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So go ahead, and do this exercise, and in the next lecture you can

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
see my solution.

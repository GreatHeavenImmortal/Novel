00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In the real world, as you modify

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
your code, it is possible that you may break one or more tests.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Now, when your new to unit testing, you may get frustrated, you may

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
think these tests are getting in the way, and they're slowing you down,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
so you may get tempted to delete those tests, or comment them

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
out. But this is a very bad approach, because there was a reason to write

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
those tests. So, we can deploy and refactor your code with more

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
confidence. So, in this lecture, I want to show you a technique

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
for temporarily disabling a test so you can focus on

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
some work somewhere else and then get to fix that test somewhere in the future

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
in NUnit we have this useful attribute called

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Ignore. This attribute takes

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
an argument, and this is the reason we want to ignore this test.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This is very useful, because we can see this message when running our

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
tests. It will remind us why we disabled these tests.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So, let's add a message here, because

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I wanted to. Now, I'm going to run all the tests

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
in this project,

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
look at the test for the app method. You can see this yellow

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
warning, ignore it, because I wanted it to. So, this is

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
the better approach, and deleting a test or commenting it out.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Because when you comment out a test, you forget to remove that comment later.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But the Ignore attribute and this warning message will remind you.

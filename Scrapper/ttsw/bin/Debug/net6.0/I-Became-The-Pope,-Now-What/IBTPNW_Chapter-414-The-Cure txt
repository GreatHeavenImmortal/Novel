Sylvester did not react shocked. He already knew that he'd find situations like these. He had seen similar things in his previous life as well. Any wartorn country had such conditions. Humanity had the ability to do the worst and, at the same time, be the kindest. But, the latter was rarer than the first.
"In our case, there isn't much we can do to help them either," Sylvester concluded and just saw the filthy transactions take place. There was no law; there was no god. All that was there was a facade.
Archbishop Nelson sighed and got down from the carriage, and started walking towards a group of kids that were too young to partake in anything that was going on there. They simply saw their parents go around.
They were wary of the Archbishop at first, but when the old man took out what looked like sweet candies, they all swarmed him like bees. They gathered around him and held onto his leg. Some tried to climb him up as well since the old man was too tall.
"Hoho, strong ones, aren't you?" The Archbishop rested down on the ground and started to distribute the candies to all of them. They were all malnourished, and their heads looked bigger than their bodies. It was not a sight that any man would want to see, but it was something they had to accept.
Sylvester also arrived near the kids and, with Miraj's help, took out many bananas because that was what Miraj kept with him most of the time in huge numbers. He did it begrudgingly, but since it was for the kids, Miraj did it.
"Who wants the bananas?" Sylvester asked and started handing one to each of them.
The kids didn't have much strength to peel it all though, so Sylvester had to help them as well. They were on the verge of dying, and there was not enough medicine to help them. What they needed was food and care, and sadly, that was the last thing they could find there.
"What do you want to do, your grace?" Sylvester asked the old man who allowed the kids to play with his long white beard and hair. He was having too much fun and seemed like a genuine grandfatherly man.
Nelson glanced back at Sylvester, his eyes slightly watery and his voice turned hoarse. "This isn't why I joined the Holy Land, Priest. I desired peace, love and kindness everywhere. I desired equality and quality of life, a world without wars… This shatters my heart."
"For how long have you tried to make things better here?" Sylvester inquired as he smelled an intense scent of foul rotten meat, signifying sadness.
The old man, showing not an ounce of disgust, wiped the faces of the kids as they were dirty. He used his magic and his own church robes as towels. "Half a century ago, I made my way to this despondent domain known as the Sorrow Kingdom. Initially, my aspirations were lofty, but as time progressed, I began to acknowledge the stark reality. After the Duke of the Patch's insurrection, the situation in the Sorrow Kingdom plummeted sharply. The Patch annexed all the arable land, and widespread famine became a commonplace occurrence."
The venerable Archbishop heaved a deep sigh and continued to tend to the children under his care. "I did everything in my power to handle the situation. But what could a mere banished Archbishop achieve against entire kingdoms? I endeavoured to alleviate suffering and cure those afflicted, but ultimately, my efforts depleted me of all vitality due to Solarium exhaustion. Despite my abundant talent, I could never rise above the rank of Archwizard. I attempted to gain the trust of King Sorrow and provide him with sound counsel, but the insatiable thirst of the Patch was too much for me to appease. Now, we witness the grim dance of death consuming the young ones.
"I cannot help but feel that I have failed, young man. I failed in my duty, and I failed Solis, as I could not spread his message of peace and harmony. If only I could receive a sign or some indication that I have followed the correct path, I could depart this life in a state of tranquillity."
Sylvester rested in silence for a few minutes. He could feel what the old man was going through. Chasing a goal without knowing if you were on the right path to achieve it was something that could make people go mentally unstable. And there was the Archbishop still with all the love and warmth, trying to help those he could.
'What did he do to be ignored and sent to the Sorrow Kingdom?' He wondered.
Thud!
"Priest Johnathan, we found him."
Suddenly, Bishop Lazark and Sir Dolorem arrived in their disguised forms and threw a man beside Sylvester's feet. The man was tall with a big belly, bald on the head, white-skinned and with a face that only a mother could love, for his teeth were rotten, his nose was half chopped away, and many scars were as hideous as they could be.
Sylvester didn't let the man get up and stomped his foot on his chest. "Who is he?"
"He is the administrator of this camp here appointed by the Patch. Heathen! Speak of your crimes, or we shall skin you alive and feed it to you." Sir Dolorem introduced the man and threatened him at the same time.
Interested, Sylvester pressed on the man's chest harder. "What did you do? Speak, or the Archbishop here shall execute you immediately, for he holds the authority."
The man rambled everything out before Sylvester could even press his feet more. Loyalty didn't run very strong among the men of the Patch, it appeared.
 "I am a mere administrator of this little camp. I am to run this place. That was all the instructions I was given. I get no money to run this place, as the money sent towards me gets taken and distributed among the seniors. I have to make money here, so I use whatever means I have. Since the village sits on the trading route, I let these people earn money."
Crunch!
Sylvester pressed further on the chest, creating the sound of bones breaking. "Is that so? Then why are they still poor? Why are these children still starving?"
Clank!
Sir Dolorem inched the blade of his sword closer to the man's neck. "Say it!"
"I… I take eighty percent of the money they earn… and they must buy their own food, which is so costly that they have to earn for two months to afford one week's ration. T-That is why they are like t-t… Argh! Please! I was jus–"
Before Sylvester could do anything else, Archbishop Nelson pulled Sylvester away and stomped on the man's neck in his stead. The man's eyes turned red in rage, and his voice shattered in seething anger. "You are nothing but a lowly, insolent heathen! Even in the midst of this dire crisis, you prioritise your own interests over the lives of innocent souls. Do you not possess an iota of fear for the divine? Can you not feel their immense suffering?"
Blood oozed out of the man's mouth as his ribs punctured into his lungs from the immense force. The Archbishop, who seemed like a sage not a while back, now seemed like a god of war.
Thud!
In no time, his entire foot caved into the man's chest and burst through the chest, spreading a sight of gore. There were kids, men and women around too, but they didn't react, for the blood was a sight all too common for them.
"Such heathens deserve not a single more breath in our realm. Priest Johnathan, go and find all the money he had and buy food for these poor souls. I shall call forth an Inquisitor Commander to oversee the camp from now on." Archbishop Nelson ordered.
Sylvester played his part and went ahead with the orders. Furthermore, he added the name of the entire Grand Duchy of Patch's administration to his kill list. After all, he had seen many such refugee camps, and they were all under Patch's control.
He looked inside the lavish house and office of the dead man and found all the money he could. On top of the money he found, he put a few more Gold Graces out of his own pocket in the same bag.
Tap!
As Sylvester was tying up the bag of money, a tiny fluffy paw stopped him. "Maxy, I also give some from my pocket money. Kiddies need help, so I help."
Sylvester glanced at Miraj sitting on his arm. "Are you sure, Chonky?"
"Aye Aye, Maxy. I got enough to buy more bananas. They need this money more than me." Miraj replied, looking saner than ever before. "I didn't like those kiddies. They looked like skeletons. I thought they were Laz-Laz's undead."
Sylvester took ten Gold Graces from Miraj and put them in the bag too. "You don't need to do this, Chonky. But now that you are, I appreciate it. I may not be a good person and do believe in conquering at all costs, but even I draw the line here. Killing the population of an entire kingdom for my selfish greed is not my cup of tea. Spies have no honour, but I am more than a spy now."
Tap!
Miraj climbed near Sylvester's face and patted his cheeks. "Of course, you're also my son. I adopted you. Did you forget?"
Sylvester chuckled and walked out of the lavish office. "Well, I guess you did adopt me. Without you, growing up in that place would have been boring. Anyway, let's finish our plotting soon and start reaping the benefits. Once we're done with this kingdom, I will go and learn metal manipulation."
"Aye aye… But can't we just feed everyone in this kingdom?" Miraj asked. "How much money do we need for that? I got lots of it."
Sylvester hummed and calculated the numbers. "Let me see… Since the Sorrow Kingdom has a population of around sixty-eight million, we need to provide at least two loaves of bread daily to feed all of them. One loaf of bread costs three Copper Muds, which makes it four hundred and eight million copper muds. That's almost four hundred and eight thousand Silver Crowns or Four thousand and eighty Gold Graces. This is just for one day, so multiplying it by a month makes it one hundred and twenty-two thousand Gold Graces. That's a lot of money, Chonky."
Thud!
All of a sudden, the sound of something falling resounded. Sylvester looked behind, and there was Chonky fallen from his shoulder on the hard stone floor of the lavish house. Chonky's eyes seemed hazy, and he remained on his back.
"Hah, was that too much calculation for you?" He asked and picked his fluffy friend up.
Miraj grumpily nodded. "Maxy, let's just go and steal it!"
Sylvester smirked, somewhat evilly. "Oh, my dear Chonky. You meant to say 'Donation' in the name of the lord?"
Miraj's eyes sparkled. "YES! Donation!"

Chapter 405 The Ebony City
Sylester's plan to collect the donations was good, but it needed much work to come to fruition. Firstly, he needed to find the whales and check how to access their coffers. That required time and some intelligence gathering. Thankfully, he knew their next destination would provide him with all the needed intel.
With the money, Sylvester went to the Archbishop again. But to his amazement, the man was without his robes. He just wore pants and was cooking something on a giant fire in a huge pot.
He roared various hymns that Sylvester wrote, and his beard and hair fluttered like a madman, but surprisingly the people jumped around the fire and cheered him on. It was like some barbarian festival was going on.
The old man stood tall in front of a massive fire pit, his long white beard swaying in the heat of the flames. The colossal container he was cooking porridge in was just as impressive, standing as tall as two men and wide enough to fit a whole horse inside.
The old man smiled at people, his eyes twinkling with excitement. Then, with a flick of his wrist, he stirred the bubbling mixture inside the container, the steam rising to his face. He took a deep breath, inhaling the delicious scent mixed with the rich aroma of fresh milk and honey. The crowd gasped in anticipation, their mouths watering at the thought of tasting the magical porridge.
As he continued stirring, the old man began to chant in a language none other than wizards could understand: runes. His voice echoed through the air, and suddenly, the flames grew higher, dancing wildly around him. The crowd stepped back in awe, watching the porridge glow in a soft golden sheen.
Woosh!
With one final stir, the old man turned off the fire, and the container began to cool down. He beckoned the crowd forward, and they gathered around him eagerly, each holding a bowl out in anticipation. He scooped out generous portions of the porridge and handed it to the people. Everyone got plenty, and the kids got a little extra with some chunks of meat.
They all took a spoonful and closed their eyes in delight, savouring the delicious flavours that danced on their tongues.
At last, Sylvester also came with a bowl and took a bite. It was a simple vegetable, rice and meat porridge. There were also some spices since the people of the south loved spices more. Of course, it was nothing magical, but after a long day of work, and in the case of the people, after long months of starvation, the simple porridge was like god's gift.
"Where did you get all these ingredients from, your grace?" Sylvester asked the old man.
Archbishop Nelson showed his thumb and winked with both eyes as that was all he knew. "I bought it all from the traders."
"Bought? You had that much money?" Sylvester inquired in wonder. Because, as far as he knew, the Archbishop was poor to the point he could not even get new robes.
Nelson chuckled as he replied. "I'm not wealthy, but Count Bradley is. He permitted me to use his noble seal to settle the bills. Truly, a great man he is."
"What's his story? All the way in the Duchy of Colorwood in the north, I have heard of his devilish deeds. The story of his inhumane treatment of the refugees and his abuse of slaves to the point they die — such stories are far too common." Sylvester asked him.
The Archbishop wagged his head reluctantly and declined to expound excessively on the matter. "The rumours, I must confess, were not entirely without merit. However, it is crucial to remember that circumstances alter cases, and this particular individual has undergone a profound transformation. Time has brought a sea change in his desires, aspirations, and outlook. No longer does he covet the vanities of this world; his heart is now consumed with a desire to alleviate the suffering of his fellow beings and spread joy and goodwill wherever he goes. If you seek a more detailed account, then I'm afraid you must consult the man himself, as it is a deeply personal matter that I am not at liberty to divulge."
'What is it that they're not sharing?' Sylvester was deeply interested as he wished to gather as much information as possible before going along with one of his many plans. He needed to count any variables or issues that could arise later.
"S-Sir…"
Suddenly, a young little boy came to Sylvester and pulled his sleeves. They had finished eating their food, so all the kids were sitting and watching Sylvester and Archbishop Nelson talking.
"Yes, you need something?" Sylvester politely asked the kid.
Hesitantly but slowly, gathering the courage, the boy looked left and right at his friends first. All of them were nodding at him, clearly revealing they had made the boy come forward to ask whatever they wanted.
"C-Can… Sir, can we have more food?" The chubby-faced, likely five-year-old boy with dirty brown hair and patched clothes asked.
Sylvester looked at the big bowls of food they had already eaten. "Are you still hungry? But you just ate so much."
The boy looked down and clutched his hands on his shirt. "We… We want to keep the food for tomorrow. Just a little will do, sir."
Sylvester's shoulder instantly relaxed, and a sigh left his mouth. He ruffled the boy's hair and sent him away. "Don't worry. You will have food every day from now on. The bad people will not come to hurt you anymore."
"Really?" The boy chirped. It meant the world to him. Not having to sleep with a hungry stomach was something no less than a grace from god.
"Look at their faces. They should explore life, study, and learn new things at this age. But here they are, having to worry about getting food." The Archbishop mumbled, displeasure and disappointment evident in his voice.
Sylvester tried to ignore the old man's charitable rambling. He felt terrible for the people but could not lose his focus on the target. He had too much at stake as Kaecilius prepared to start his slave rebellion in Riveria. He had to first douse the flames in the Sorrow Kingdom and then meet with King Highland.
"There is no instant solution to this, your grace. We can only move on and try to find one, but there is always uncertainty. That's what life is. I'm no sage, but I know what's occurring here is wrong, and one day, they will have to answer to a judge, be it in the world of the living or the dead, but one thing is certain, all their deeds matter, and all their sins count." Sylvester tried to cheer up the man and finished eating up. It was time to head to the Wailing City next.
The Archbishop sighed and stood up to leave as well. "You speak well, priest. We must fight this darkness and never allow it to reign over our blessed minds. The path of Solis is the one eternal true path. As Lord Bard once said in his hymns, 'Rise not your swords but your voice. To help one or to hurt it's always a choice. For every action, there is a price. So strive to do what shall make the Lord rejoice.'"
Sylvester felt somewhat awkward since he had never met someone so overzealous about his hymns. The man randomly starts chanting them and even uses them in his speeches.
 'It's hard to assess him. He smells of worship at all times, but on the other hand, he has rage suppressed inside his mind. He has extreme anger outbursts, and that's not the sort of person I want following me.'
"Indeed, your grace. I like his hymns. They spread the message so well in a palatable fashion. His hymns are memorable, and I'm sure all those who read them remember them, no matter the means." Sylvester replied, a bit narcissistically, however. "Let's proceed to the Wailing City now."
"Let's do that."
With that, they got in their carriage in the middle of the afternoon, when the sun was at its peak, and the heat was ready to burn everything in sight. Thankfully, being wizards, they had a plethora of magical means to keep themselves and their horses cool.
So they bid farewell to the village once the Inquisitor Commander arrived to oversee the refugees. Of course, one hundred strong Inquisitor soldiers also came to ensure order was maintained.
The Inquisitors knew the price of corruption and that they'd always get the harsher punishment for betraying the church's trust. So they were the least likely to harm the people.
Soon, with Sir Dolorem and Bishop Lazark having gone ahead on the path on separate horses to check the road conditions, Sylvester and the Archbishop left the small village. Sadly, it was not the last village on their path, as there were some more refugee camps that had come into existence, one worse than the other. Unfortunately, it was impossible to help them all, so with a heavy heart, they kept on moving.
Soon enough, the carriage rattled along the dusty path, its wooden wheels creaking with each jolt. As they rounded a bend, a dark and foreboding sight greeted them. In the distance, a volcano towered above the landscape, its fiery mouth spewing molten rock and ash. The sky above was a deep crimson, the setting sun's light filtered through the thick smoke and haze.
As they made their way, it slowly turned darker, and the night dawned upon them. They rushed their horses, as the location, the darkness and the deadly volcano were bound to spawn some nasty creatures of the night. But they still could not look away from the volcano. Its presence was overwhelming, and the heat radiating from its mouth was suffocating.
As they drew nearer, they could see the devastation brought by the volcano's fury. Blackened trees lay strewn across the landscape, their twisted branches reaching out like skeletal hands. The ground was scorched and cracked, and the air smelled of sulphur and ash.
Eventually, Mount Eternal got left behind as Sylvester and the Archbishop arrived near Wailing City, the last actual city in the Sorrow Kingdom where some sense could still be made, albeit in its rundown condition.
"Where to, your grace?" Sylvester asked before they reached the gates of the city. It was a completely walled city, though the walls were all black as if burned.
"To the monastery," the Archbishop ordered.
So Sylvester moved the carriage into the city. Only two guards were at the gates, and they seemed too lazy to check them after they saw their clergy robes.
"Was there a fire?" Sylvester inquired as he noticed the buildings in the city were all black too.
"No, this is its original form, the reason why this city is also called Ebony City. The buildings here are made of Volcano stones, which are black and durable, as they don't melt in lava. In fact, the royal palace is surrounded by a moat made of lava. We're heading there, as the monastery is inside the castle."
Sylvester's interest reached cloud nine as he expected to see a Bright Mother soon and utilise his months of hard work.
However, when they reached the castle, Sylvester felt a strange deja-vu.
'Wait… I've seen this place before.'

Chapter 406 In The Vipers Nest
'I've seen this place before in my vision! That little girl, this was the place she was trying to escape and pleaded with me to help her. So she really was the princess of the Sorrow Kingdom. Is she even alive now? I must go back and try to see her in the visions.'
"Young priest? Priest! Wake up!"
Sylvester shook his head and came back to his senses. "Ah, forgive me, your grace. I merely fell into some deep thoughts. We should be arriving now."
Sylvester noticed the crowds were getting less on the city's wide roads, and more soldiers were appearing. The streets were cleaner, and the giant castle was very close, just behind the last wall from where the bridge on the lava moat was to be crossed.
"Halt! State your identity!"
The guards at the gates were especially armed with neat and clean armour. Their swords were already unsheathed, and their visors were down. There were four with swords, four with spears, and two were horse riders.
The Archbishop took out something that looked like a stone medallion. It was black and had strange silver engravings on it.
"May the sorrow fade, and the traitors embrace the blade." Archbishop Nelson said in a low voice.
Reacting to the words, the guard took the black medallion and put it on another medallion that he owned. Instantly, a spark of flash came when the two medallions touched, and a humming sound came.
"Welcome back, Archbishop." The guard respectfully returned the medallion and signalled his men to drop the drawbridge.
Sylvester silently followed the old man's lead since he knew that the Archbishop had lived and fought for the Sorrow Kingdom for years. He was bound to have various connections in all the high places and, above all, be a part of a few secret orders. The best course of action was to observe and join in the game, so he could later become the master of the same play.
Thud!
The drawbridge itself was made of volcano stone. It was heavy and took over a hundred iron chains to pull and drop the bridge. On top of that, even on the other side of the drawbridge, there was a security checkpoint.
"Let's move." The Archbishop pointed ahead.
Sylvester carefully steered the carriage onto the thick stone road and began to move. However, the moment they touched the bridge, they felt the heat emanating from underneath. Surrounding the castle was a moat filled not with water but with molten lava that spewed forth from deep within the earth. The lava glowed an eerie orange-red, casting a sinister light upon the castle's walls and towers.
Soon, the castle also came into view, the famed Castle Ashstone, entirely black, so much so that it shined during the day and the night. Sadly, it was in ruins now.
"This is..." Sylvester lacked words to describe the behemoth in front of them.
The castle stood tall and ominous, looming over the surrounding landscape with its dark, foreboding presence. Built entirely of black stone, the castle was massive in size and was dotted with numerous towers that reached up into the sky like jagged teeth. The castle's walls were impossibly thick and impenetrable, radiating a palpable sense of malevolence.
"Marvellous, isn't it? It used to be even more majestic when the King lived here." the Archbishop spoke of the old days. "Back in those days, the security was not as strict, and the city was always bustling, despite the poor status of the Kingdom. The people were kind, as they all knew each other's hardships. Food was hard to come by, but people managed and stayed happy with the name of the Lord always on their lips."
Sylvester merely nodded the entire way as they went further into the castle. They crossed the moat, and the guards there didn't stop them again. So they went directly to the castle's main entrance.
Sadly, the many walls and locations were in ruins, and men were at work trying to fix them. As majestic as the castle looked from a distance, it was ugly from close. The dirt was all over the ground, and the horse shit covered the roads. The workers were fixing the castle walls in dirty, patched clothes, and there was no sense of order anymore.
Eventually, Sylvester stopped the carriage at the gates of the Castle, where Sir Dolorem and Bishop Lazark were already waiting for them on their horses.
"Priest Johnathan, you may visit the monastery at the back of the castle while I meet the nobles gathered inside. They might doubt you since you are a new face here, so please don't mind this."
"Understood, your grace." Sylvester smelled no lies from the man, so he saluted and moved the carriage.
Even the monastery was made of volcano stones, so it was also black. But the windows were made of colourful stained glass, so there was some strange beauty to it.
Sylvester led inside first, with Sir Dolorem and Bishop Lazark behind him. The monastery was a giant hall with beautiful carvings and paintings inside. It was made of white marble, so the sense of gloom was absent.
However, he had another reason for willingly entering the monastery and not trying to spy on the Archbishop.
'Ah, there she is.'
Sylvester looked back. "Go to the gates outside and keep an eye. If someone comes, warn me."
"Understood, Priest." Sir Dolorem and Bishop Lazark asked no questions and stood guard.
Meanwhile, Sylvester walked towards a woman in pale yellow nun robes, with a dagger on one side of the waist and a book on the other. She was old, as evident by her arched back and facial wrinkles. But her blue eyes seemed more profound than anything.
She was cleaning the end part of the monastery where the giant symbol of the church was kept. So he walked beside her and spoke cryptically. "Only one way to defeat the darkness."
The woman, without even looking, replied. "Light of the Lord you must harness."
 Sylvester smiled, took a small bronze coin from his pocket, and placed it beside the woman. "May the holy light enlighten us, respected mother."
The woman took the coin, looked at it carefully, and then gave a different coin back to Sylvester. She smiled while doing so and finally looked at Sylvester's face. "It's an honour to be meeting you, my lord."
Sylvester kept the coin and relaxedly sat down on the floor beside her. "The honour is all mine, mother Thena. But first, please tell me about yourself. How are you? Do you eat well? Do you get to have some rest? Is anyone troubling you?"
The old woman's eyes welled up a little, and she immediately went for the hug. She embraced Sylvester in a motherly hug and caressed the back of his head, whispering in his ears. "After meeting you, all hardships were worth you, my lord. You are, as they say -- a son to us mothers sworn to be childless. Are you hungry? The journey must have been tiring. Come with me. I will cook something for you."
Sylvester felt the genuine feelings of the woman. Love, excitement, some sadness, and a lot of worship. It was all Sylvester ever wanted from his secret spy network of Bright Mothers. All he gave them was love as a son, and in return, they also showered him with love. He was, after all, the only man they could be so close to without worrying about any unholy consequences. In Bright Mothers' eyes, Sylvester was too holy to hold any impure thoughts -- he was perfection.
Sylvester held the old woman's palms on his own and used some healing magic, as her hands appeared to have skin damage. "I am fine, mother. I am sent by his Holiness to judge the heathens of the Sorrow Kingdom. But, to relieve the pain of the poor, I need money. For that, I need information about the wealth numbers and locations of all those still rich that reside in this kingdom."
Thena bobbed her head vigorously and started telling him everything she knew. "There are still a few noble lords in the Sorrow Kingdom. They are the ones who switched to the Patch's side before or after the fall of the royal family. They are no less than the heathens of the Patch, my lord. In total, fifteen such noble families are left, and their names are House Larkaster, House Harmund, House Marla..."
She gave the names of all the houses she knew about. On top of that, there was something more she could provide.
"My lord, end these heathen families, for they have brought nothing but misery to the innocents. When the King Sorrow was fighting the Patch, these heathens backstabbed him... That poor princess, we don't even know what happened to her... She was so full of life..." She began to tear up a little but held herself strong even then.
Sylvester stood up again. "Mother, can you use your contacts to at least get me the maps of the castles of these families? They have stolen money from the poor. It's time I give that money back."
"Of course, my lord. It will take all but seven days for me to compile everything. We have a few maps in the Royal Castle's library too. I can gather them for you if you wish." She instantly prepared herself to move around, despite her age.
Sylvester didn't like that, so he first handed her a small pouch filled with gold coins. "Use this to escape this region in case of an emergency. All of you are like mothers to me, and even one of you in trouble will bring me nightmares. As for the maps, I will look for them myself. Archbishop Nelson is already inside, meeting with the nobles gathered there."
"What?!" The Bright Mother exclaimed all of a sudden, her face going pale. "Why didn't you stop him?!"
Sylvester rubbed his face in frustration. "Don't tell me... All those nobles are the ones you named."
"Yes! They are gathered here to divide the Kingdom among themselves as Dukes."
Sylvester took a long breath and tried to contemplate his options. The Archbishop was strong, but a single Archwizard could not fight so many nobles who likely had strong subordinates, if not personally strong.
'Of course, my rotten luck will ensure they are strong and too many.'
"Why didn't Archbishop know all this?" Sylvester asked her.
"That I don't know, as all of us clergypeople know what's happening for a month now. Could it be that he..."
She didn't finish her words, but Sylvester knew what they were. 'Is he one of them? A vile man hidden behind a grandfatherly face? But I smelled nothing of that sort from him.'
Knock Knock!
"Priest Johnathan." Sir Dolorem entered the monastery hall with a nobleman in armour behind. "This is the Prima of House Harmund. Archbishop calls us inside."
Sylvester started blinking morse code instantly to speak with Sir Dolorem. At the same time, he talked with the Prima.
"Thank you for coming here to call us, my lord. Let's go in then." Sylvester greeted, all the while smelling an intense scent of fear and hate emanating from the man.
Just then, Sylvester also finished warning Sir Dolorem with the code.
'It's a trap. Prepare for battle. All limits are hereby lifted.'

Chapter 407 Wolf In Sheeps Clothing
Sylvester also warned Miraj, who slept on his shoulder. He discreetly ate some solarium crystals to recuperate any lost energy to return to his utmost peak strength. His spells sat on his tongue's tip, and his fist prepared itself to react.
Sylvester had already warned Sir Dolorem, and in return, the man had warned Bishop Lazark. So all of them were prepared to make a move. But, unfortunately, there was nowhere to run anyway since they quickly realised the castle's strongest protection was also their confine. The giant, wide moat of lava was the boundary they could not cross, for they could not fly.
'As long as there are no Grand Wizards, I should be fine.' Sylvester calmed himself down to mentally prepare himself.
Slowly but surely, they all slowly came closer to the enormous castle. Finally, the Prima of the Harmund Family gradually changed his pace and came behind them to ensure they had nowhere to escape.
Sylvester talked in morse code with Sir Dolorem as they formulated a plan to escape if needed. They didn't want to lose their lives over some petty politics.
'I saw a large vent near the entrance of the castle,' Sylvester informed Sir Dolorem.
In response, Sir Dolorem also blinked in morse code. 'I noticed a separate entrance for the servants. They likely have different entries and exits. We can use that if need be.'
'Yes, if the need arises. Let's try and kill them all for now. They have tried to lay hands on two men of Archbishop ranks, one Bishop and one Inquisitor General. This alone deems them worthy of facing article 66.'
'Understood, lord bard. We shall try and turn their trap into their own deadly prison.'
Sylvester nodded and continued to walk slowly, trying to earn as much time as possible. If the fight were to happen inside, he could already see the beautiful castle being destroyed soon.
But one more possibility came to his mind, one that he could use to his advantage. 'They likely don't know who I am yet. This means they likely think I'm just some random weak priest. If that's the case, I can use a surprise attack and wound a majority of them in one go.'
He quickly spoke in morse code with Sir Dolorem and asked them to prepare their surprise attacks to reap the best benefits from their disguised looks.
"In there, priests." The Prima voiced from behind.
They soon arrived in front of a giant, ten metres high twin door. The door was made of some black material, and a red volcano was painted on it, likely depicting Mount Eternal. The colours were fading, however, telling the sorry story of what transpired in the castle.
Woosh!
A gust of wind came as the twin doors started to open on their own. As the other side came into view, Sylvester felt mesmerised. As he entered the castle's grand hall, he was immediately struck by the sheer size of the space. The hall was colossal, with soaring arches stretching high overhead and massive stone columns made of black or white marble stones. The floor was also made of polished marble, but black in colour with golden patterns. It reflected the light of the massive chandeliers that hung from the ceiling, casting a warm glow throughout the room.
At the far end of the hall sat a throne adorned with glittering jewels and intricate carvings of mythical beasts, the mount eternal and much more. The throne was set atop a dais of pure white marble, reached by a grand staircase that curved elegantly up from the floor. The walls of the hall were decorated with tapestries depicting epic battles, heroic deeds and the rich history of the Kingdom.
'Is that the Archbishop on the throne?' Sylvester noticed the figure sitting on the intricate majestic seat.
At the base of the throne, below the grand staircase, there stood fifteen men, all either old or in their late forties. They wore fine shining armour with capes and helmets while their swords were unsheathed. Some of them were also wizards, as evident by their staff. They all had different features, some blonde, some redheaded and some even bald. But none of them were fat, and that alone told the story of their strength.
Sylvester only focused on the figure on the throne. 'Why isn't he moving?'
"You called for us, your grace?" Sylvester asked the Archbishop.
There was an eerie silence in the hall. Albeit its majesty, there was nothing majestic about it. On the contrary, it all felt gloomy since Sylvester knew about its history and that the men standing before him were the traitors who brought darkness to the Kingdom.
"He won't be speaking anymore, priest." One of the men in armour spoke. He had black hair, brown eyes and a brown complexion. He stood among the men as if he were their leader.
Sylvester didn't appear too shocked and asked back in calmness. "What do you mean? Who are you?"
The man walked forward, his long sword with a golden hilt and green jade raised forward. "I am the new Duke of Wailing City, Duke Larkaster, the head of United Duchies of Sorrow. If you still can't understand what happened to your 'grace', then you are too stupid to be even alive. Now, which one are you? Stupid? Or smart? Because if you're smart, you might not share the same fate as that old man."
Sylvester falsely flinched, showing some fear. "Y-You killed Archbishop? Why? What do you want?"
"What do we want? This kingdom, of course. Not the Patch, nor the Holy Land. We shall rule these lands on our own. Now, I feel gracious today, just for once, so I will allow you to return to the Holy Land. But, before that, you must also kill your two partner priests." Larkaster replied while keeping a big smug smile on his face. His teeth appeared wide open, his eyes narrowing a little. He truly enjoyed tormenting others. That was clear.
Sylvester used all his acting skills to sit down and crawl towards the 'Duke'. His eyes became watery, and his nose runny. He made himself look like a man pleading for his life. So as he crawled, he cried to the Duke.
"Please, don't make me do this, your highness. My oath will be broken then... I can't harm my brothers.'
Sylvester inched closer to the man, one step at a time, all the while crawling. His face remained contorted, as if in a lot of pain and misery.
"Haha, it's always a delight to see you all almighty holy men plead for life." Duke Larkaster mockingly stated and waited for Sylvester to reach him. "Fine, I will let them go if you come here and lick my boot once."
Cough~
"STOP! Don't lower your...self...to their level! You are a preacher of Solis!"
Shocking everyone, Archbishop from the throne shouted as his body moved a few inches, announcing to all that he was still alive. His voice, however, was feeble and hoarse.
"Rise, priest... Don't do it. It's better to die here..."
Sylvester continued to crawl towards the Duke. "I-I don't want to die... I want to live... Forgive me, your grace."
"Hah... See this, Nelson? Not everyone is like you. Some do hold a sane mind. Duke Harmund, go and silence him. I do not wish for this moment to be spoiled by his rambling. Now come here, dog, lick my foot."
Sylvester did so, keeping the act of a scared lowly man going on. In a minute, he reached the Duke on all fours and stopped.
"Wait!" The Duke ordered. "Let me make it better."
Ptui!
"Now lick it." Duke spat on his boot and ordered again. "Clean it as if it was polished yesterday. I want the gold to shine enough that you can see yourself on it."
Sylvester nodded and lowered himself slowly. All eyes focused on him. The hand of Sir Dolorem stayed clutched to his sword's hilt while Bishop Lazark stayed prepared to launch as many undead as he could summon.
On the side, Duke Harmund went and knocked Archbishop Nelson to sleep again. "Go to sleep, old man."
With that, all eyes returned to focus on Sylvester. But something was off as he had stopped lowering his face to the boot. Instead, he looked up with his bloodshot eyes, right into the eyes of Duke Larkaster.
Woosh!
A blinding light glowed all of a sudden, and a halo appeared behind Sylvester's head. His voice echoed with it, loud, strong and menacing to those who had sinned, and warming to those hurt.
â™«Listen, for here speaks the Son of Solis, the Bard.
You dare tarnish his name; you angered the lord.
So prepare for the light to incinerate you now.
Enough, no more blasphemy shall I allow.â™«
Woosh!
"Aaargh!"
The Duke suddenly screamed in agony and took a few steps back.
 "Y-You! Argh!"
Sylvester was too fast, and before the Duke had even known, a sword had suddenly plunged into him. Sylvester had thrust the blade from below, piercing the Duke's groin and entering his guts, puncturing everything apart.
His strength was enough to ignore the strong armour, so he also twisted the blade a little to ensure maximum pain and damage was inflicted.
Sylvester then stood up while still chanting the hymn. He stretched his arms and cracked his neck. His face was fully serious, annoyed to the peak. He still sang the hymn as his attack had not stopped yet.
â™«This is where the battle for justice merely begins.
The time has come to pay for your sins
For that, I shall cut away your proud wings.
So rejoice, for you die in the presence of my hymns.â™«
Boom!
The entire ground started to shake, and cracks began to appear. It was like an earthquake. But soon, it became evident it wasn't natural, for light magic hotter than the lava started to bloom out of the cracks.
Thud!
Duke Larkaster stumbled back, trying to maintain balance. But he only fell to his knees, which in return pierced the stuck sword further in, puncturing his lungs and heart as well. His death was imminent, and the rest could only feel their knees weakening.
â™«Witness my wrath! Witness my Fury!
Now, I am the Judge, and I am the Jury!â™«
Boom!
The very foundations of the earth trembled and quaked as if seized by a primal fury. With a sound akin to thunder, the ground shattered into thousands of pieces, the pillars that once stood so tall and proud crumbled into dust, and the beautiful ceiling that adorned the art and chandeliers fell down in a shower of debris. The destruction brought upon the structure was just the beginning, for the screams of those caught in the chaos had already begun to fill the air.
The very ground beneath their feet seemed to writhe and contort as if seeking to devour those who dared to stand upon it. The cracks that appeared without warning swallowed the weak, dragging them down into the unknown depths below. And as some were swallowed whole, others were consumed by the raging light that burst forth from the same cracks, scorching flesh and bones alike, amputating limbs and leaving nothing but devastation in its wake.
All the while, the halo shined, the loud and proud hymns continued -- the song of death never stopped.
â™«Lives of so many that you made so hard.
This is their reply, in the worst regard.
I am lord's shield, the innocent's guard.
I am Sylvester Maximilain, Lord's Bard!â™«

Chapter 408 Reaction To Action
Once a magnificent fortress towering over the landscape, the giant castle Ashtone now lay in ruins, its walls crumbling and its towers collapsing. The once proud flag that flew atop the highest tower now lay tattered and torn on the ground.
The destruction began slowly as small cracks appeared in the castle's foundation. But soon, the cracks spread, growing broader and deeper with each passing second. The walls began to shift and sway, groaning under the weight of the castle's massive stone blocks.
As Sylvester's destructive magic took its final form, nothing could save the ancient structure. Everything came down, crumbling like a house of glass.
As the dust cleared, the destruction became clear. The castle lay in ruins, its stones scattered about like a child's toys. The once-mighty towers were now mere piles of rubble, and the moat full of lava was raging with fire since much of the wreckage fell into it.
But the destruction didn't end there. The falling stones and debris had spread out from the castle, wreaking havoc on the surrounding lands. Trees were uprooted, buildings were destroyed, and the earth was torn apart.
In the same spot as before, Sylvester stayed still, and his hymn continued to echo until the last wall fell. His control over the Hellfire Purge move was enough to ensure he didn't harm his allies.
"Don't let your guard down!" Sylvester roared. "If you see something moving — Kill!"
From there, the hunt began. Sylvester, Sir Dolorem and Bishop Lazark kept out their blades and started to look around. But Sir Dolorem was the most helpful as he removed his eyepatch and used his heightened hearing to find any activity in the rubble.
"Someone is here!" Sir Dolorem voiced to alert everyone.
Boom!
Without waiting, Sir Dolorem used simple fire and earth magic. First, he created a tiny tunnel to the voice's origin and then sent fire blazing down into the tunnel.
"Aaarg~"
Soon enough, the screams came, and they only increased with time. But eventually, they started to die down, and once there were no screams, Sir Dolorem stopped. Then he continued his search for the next target.
Meanwhile, Bishop Lazark had an even better way. He simply tried to summon the undead who had just died. That way, he instantly discovered that only five of the fifteen nobles had been killed in the rubble. So, the search continued as Bishop Lazark, this time, sent undead rats to look for the living.
As for Sylvester, he didn't have undead or heightened senses. What he did have was an excellent fluffy friend, Miraj. Miraj just roamed around and sniffed as much as he could.
"Maxy! Come, come!" Miraj whispered as loud as he could to get Sylvester's attention. "Something's here."
Sylvester knew Miraj wasn't joking, so he wasted no time thrusting his spear directly into the rubble.
"Ah!"
The cry came, and following that, Sylvester stabbed as many times as possible until he couldn't hear any more cries. But he also poured some fire in just to be sure.
The process continued for a while, and one by one, they confirmed the death of fourteen of the nobles. They got their bodies out with Bishop Lazark's help. But still, the last one was missing, and it appeared they had survived the fall and had hidden somewhere.
"Don't stop! We must find him and kill him. It's Lord Harmund, if I remember correctly." Sylvester ordered the two.
The search continued, and the night slowly dawned upon the Wailing city. Thankfully, all the paths to leave the castle were blocked since Sylvester's magic had also broken the drawbridge. There was only lava waiting for whoever tried to escape.
Eventually, they broadened their search and started to look around near the edges of the land the castle was built upon. They went close to the lava moat to see if the man had already fallen in and died.
Sadly, hours passed, and they found nothing. Finally, the entire night went by in search, and the sun started to bask the destroyed land in warmth.
"It seems he has somehow escaped." Sir Dolorem mumbled as they all took some rest finally.
Sylvester didn't sit, however. He walked back and forth in frustration as his plan was in jeopardy. "This won't do. We need to find that man, or everything will go to waste. The Patch does not know I'm here yet, so we have the best window to catch them unaware of anything. He will likely head to his noble lands to gather the armies if he has escaped. I will disguise as him and arrive there earlier. If my plans work, we might be able to feed the Sorrow Kingdom for months to come."
"What are you planning, my lord?" Bishop Lazark asked curiously.
"Nothing but charity, Bishop Lazark. For long enough, the nobles of this kingdom have looted the people. Now they shall pay them back, willingly or unwillingly; it's up to them. I will leave immediately, so you two must remain beside the Archbishop while he's being healed. Send a missive to Count Bradley and tell him to bring his forces to the Wailing City directly. We shall make this city our home base for now. Then, since the Patch will not interfere for a month, we'll have enough time to move." Sylvester prepared himself mentally for the task at hand.
Sir Dolorem sighed and agreed with the plan. But he had some advice for Sylvester. "Find a few men from Lord Harmund's entourage and take them along when you return, Lord Bard. Try to find as much as possible about Lord Harmund, his family and the lands. If you and Lord Harmund arrived in the noble lands simultaneously, you might have to answer a few questions to prove yourself to be the real one."
"Thank you for the advice, Sir Dolorem. And Bishop Lazark, can you give me one of the undead birds? So that I can contact you if needed."
Bishop Lazark nodded and looked at the sky. Instantly, one live bird came down and sat on his extended palm. In a second, the bird sat down and slowly started to decompose. A minute later, only the skeleton remained, and the bird still seemed as alive as before.
After that, Bishop Lazark whispered something to the bird, and in response, the bird automatically flew and sat on Sylvester's shoulder.
"It shall remain with you until the destruction of its body, Lord Bard." Bishop Lazark informed.
Fascinated, Sylvester held the little bird in hand. "Your necromancy is so… Bizarre and interesting at the same time. It's too rare to find necromancers in the first place."
Bishop Lazark chuckled, a rarity coming from the man. "It's not that there are not enough of us. It's just that most of us like to live in seclusion, in dark and isolated places. There is a social stigma attached to our branch of magic, so we avoid crowds. I am a member of the church, so my case is slightly different."
Sylvester stood up at that and decided to leave immediately. "Well, I'm delighted that you are one of us, Bishop. Having you as an enemy would have been a pain. I shall take my leave now, be safe and don't take any unnecessary actions. Try to regroup and wait for the Inquisitors to arrive. If any response comes from the Holy Land, please forward it to me."
"May the Holy Light enlighten your path, my lord." Sir Dolorem stood up and saluted.
"Be safe, my lord." Bishop Lazark added.
Sylvester gave a light nod and left silently, disappearing somewhere beyond the rubble of the fallen castle.
 "I wonder how spectacularly he will win this time." Sir Dolorem muttered with not an ounce of worry on his face.
"You seem quite confident, Sir Dolorem." Bishop Lazark looked at the man.
"Hah, after years of looking at Lord Bard's majesty, I'd be foolish not to have confidence in him."
Bishop Lazark bobbed his head in agreement. "He did get you your eyes back."
"And his inventions!" Sir Dolorem exclaimed like a proud man.
…
At the same time, thousands of kilometres to the north, in the Holy Land, an urgent meeting of the Sanctum Council was called by the Pope. In the secret chambers, the faces were serious, and the breaths were controlled as all heard the report from Saint Medico, Pope's chief healer, Cardinal Charles Nos Leeds.
"...After extensive research and testing, I have determined that the plague sample Lord Bard sent does indeed consist of Solarium. But what amazed me was that it's not a new plague, but just a combination of the last five most deadliest plague and solarium. Therefore, it's impossible to come into existence naturally."
Faces turned darker at that revelation. Inquisitor High Lord, the head of all of the Holy land's military and the Inquisitor rose up and coldly stated his wishes. "Your Holiness, for far too long, the Patch has gone unchecked. Like all, they, too, are Solis' subject and yet show no respect. Therefore, permit me to lead the Armies and the Inquisitor and bring the Grand Duke to heels — I shall make them bleed until each one of them kneels."
The Pope raised his palm and silenced the giant Lord of Inquisiton. "Calm down, Lord Inquisitor. Do not forget the proposal sent by Sylvester. As he noticed, the Sorrow Kingdom is reeling with the after-effects of an unprecedented destructive earthquake. To win the people, it's easy. But we must win the land. If Sylvester's plan works, we may be able to win over everything without laying a finger."
"But…" Saint Wazir spoke. "To give the money, it's easy and understandable. To give the manpower, it's doable. But, to make him Cardinal Suprima, even a temporary one, it will raise many fingers from the Council of Thirty-Two."
"I will handle them." Saint Seer, the spymaster, spoke, a rare thing as he had only harmed Sylvester over the past many years. "Lord Bard has been a Cardinal Suprima before and did a splendid job. We can use that achievement. We must give him all the help we can before the plague spreads too far."
Inquisitor High Lord glanced at the Saint Seer with his glaring red eyes behind the visor. "The last time you made him Cardinal Suprima, he was ordered to execute Article 66 on Count Ranthburg, which brought the ire of Shadow Knight on him. So what is your true desire? Is it to spread the fire?"
Saint Seer visibly sweated as he did remember all those 'mistakes'. So he lowered his head and reassured. "Worry not, Lord Inquisitor. I have no hidden desires anymore."
The Pope nodded, stamped on a sheet, and quickly wrote down the appointment. "It's decided then. Sylvester shall be temporarily made the Cardinal Suprima of the Sorrow Kingdom and the Patch. He's already the Special Judge, so this will only make his work easier. But, as for the plague, I need you to go there personally, Saint Medico. Take some of the Void Keepers with you, and you shall have supreme command of them. If you tell them to die, they shall die."
"Understood, your grace."
The Pope faced the Lord Inquisitor then. "Visit the monasteries, Inquisitors and Holy Army camps near The Patch's border. Prepare for an invasion, if it comes to that — A quick, overwhelming operation. Use all Guardians if you must."
Lord Inquisitor stood up and thumped his chest. His enraged voice echoed in the room before he left.
"Understood, your holiness. For each tear of innocents they have forced to be spilled. With their blood, the payback shall be fulfilled."

Chapter 409 Chonky, The Sneaky Boy
As Sylvester had planned, he arrived at the noble lands of Lord Harmund. The region the noble lord lived in was one of the most coveted and still somewhat livable regions as it was close to where the previous tributary river of the Snake River used to flow before The Patch diverted the river waters.
Harmund County had relative peace from what Sylvester noticed. But that was only from the outside, as the moment he entered the lands, he saw nothing but misery. There were poor refugees working in the fields under direct sunlight with no clothes but pants on their bodies. They had dried skin and thin bodies. Their eyes were devoid of any hope.
 All that when some guards roamed around them on horses and whipped them for slowing down even for a second. The same was the fate for all, be it men, women or children. All were beaten and forced to work.
'Now I don't feel bad at all. The whole family is cancer to the region.' Sylvester passed his judgement, for he was the Special Judge and had the power to do so. The lord was just a Count, which was well within Sylvester's authority.
Soon, Sylvester's small entourage of ten horsemen arrived at the small castle made of sandy yellow walls. It was nothing special, just a simple castle on a hill. A small town was around it, but it was crowded with more slaves and workers than the original people.
"My lord!"
The people started to bow to Sylvester as he inched closer to the castle gates beyond the moat. The guards didn't stop him and merely saluted to show respect.
Sylvester spoke with the Prima behind him, the man who should know the most about the Count. But, even he could not realise that Sylvester was an imposter and the entire way, he gave all the information to Sylvester willingly.
Slowly, Sylvester formed himself into the exact replica image of the Count. Of course, he didn't see the man walk around and speak too much, but he could read a lot from how someone walked, talked and generally acted.
Eventually, they entered the castle, and the drawbridge got lifted. Sylvester carried himself regally and got off his horse. A middle-aged, regal-looking, beautiful blonde woman was waiting at the entrance to the castle, looking anxious.
Sylvester went to her straight away and pulled her in his arms. He hugged her and whispered something in her ears that made her blush instantly.
'I could already smell the worry, the love and the lust. Harmund was a strong, handsome wizard warrior, and he had a love marriage with this woman. I must keep her senses flooded with lust so she can't sense anything else about me.'
Sylvester discreetly touched her neck with his hand and spread the ointment on the skin that could increase her lust to some degree. In response, she hugged him tighter, so much so that Sylvester had to push her to be free.
"Let's get inside, Duchess," Sylvester said.
"What?!" The woman exclaimed and jumped in excitement. "You're not lying? You're serious?"
Sylvester nodded. "Of course, my love. The plan was successful, and now you are a proud Duchess, the keeper of my heart."
She blushed and tucked her hand around his arm to walk with him inside. The castle was magnificent and well-decorated, like all other castles. But, it was evident by looking that the region was not as rich as those in the north. In the Sorrow Kingdom, a Count's wealth was not even equal to a Viscount in Gracia and Riveria.
"It's nearly nighttime, so I shall move to my bed chambers and rest." Sylvester authoritatively ordered.
No one dared to say anything, and he let the Count's wife drag him to the bed chambers. She was in a hurry, however, and Sylvester was prepared for everything.
Soon, they climbed the stairs and arrived at the tower's top floor. There, the glasses covered the wall in all directions, giving a magnificent view of the entire landscape. Under the moonlight and the dimly candlelit room, the view was beautiful.
"My lord husband, you were gone for so long." The woman muttered and started to take off her clothes in a rush.
Sylvester sighed and did the same. 'Why do I put myself in such situations?'
Eventually, the woman unclothed her completely and lunged at Sylvester. She tried to pin him down and shower his neck with wet kisses.
'What kind of sexual life were they living? A good one, it seems.'
But Sylvester had no interest in the woman, so he just pushed his index finger into her mouth. At first, she licked it, thinking it was some sort of foreplay. But soon, her eyes started to get heavy, and she instantly fell unconscious.
After that, Sylvester tucked her in the sheets, and then left after dressing up — His oath and purity still intact.
"Chonky, did you find anything?" Sylvester asked as he found the chubby furry cat dozing outside the room.
Miraj jolted up and jumped to sit on Sylvester's shoulder. "Aye, aye, Maxy! I found a big secret vault underground. It has a big door, but I easily ate it and took the money. Nothing can stop the Chonky bank from taking the taxes."
Sylvester patted him and handed him a banana. "Good job. Let's just burn the castle down and leave. If they die, they die — they are all heathens who abuse the commoners. Their death shall not bring me any sin."
With the plan in mind, Sylvester strategically poured some special fire alchemical solution around the castle. He walked around and greeted the servants, the knights and the rest of the staff. The Count only had a mother and wife, so he didn't see them again.
Three hours past midnight, Sylvster was done and exited the castle in the name of inspecting the town.
"Stop there!"
However, as soon as he exited the drawbridge, he noticed a man trying to run into the castle. He looked dirty, with his face burned, his clothes dirty black.
"I-I am your Count! What are you doing? Unhand me!" The man screamed.
The guards caught him and made him kneel quickly. One of them ridiculed him while smacking the hilt of his sword on the head. "Filth! The Count is already in the castle. Do you think we are fools?"
"I… I am your Count! I was married to Lady Maria ten years ago, in this castle. I have a mole on my back, and when I was a kid, I killed a lion with a small knife! I am your lord!"
Sylvester arrived near just then. "What is going on here? Who is this pest?"
The Guards saluted. "Nothing, my lord. Just another maniac trying to enter the castle."
The real Count, with his burned face, looked at Sylvester in shock and fear. He had no idea what was happening, but he understood he had no chance to prove himself as real.
"I will kill you!" The real Count got up and tried to run away while shouting.
Sylvester scoffed and grabbed the sword from the guard's waist. He aimed it at the fleeting Count. "You dared put my woman and mother in danger! It's you who must die!"
Woosh!
Sylvester threw the sword masterfully. It swung fast, cutting the air smoothly. In a moment, the blade struck the back of Count's head, instantly throwing him down and cutting open his skull in two.
"Burn his body and throw his ashes into the moat," Sylvester ordered haughtily and continued to walk out. This time, he felt much better as he killed the last witness of the massacre in Wailing City.
Ting!
Ting!
"Fire in the castle!"
Just three minutes after he left the castle, the shouts resounded across the town outside. The people rushed to quench the fire. But it was too big and strong for anyone to control.
On top of that, they couldn't find the Count anywhere. People feared that the fire took him. But the guards at the drawbridge revealed the Count had already left. In absolute pandemonium, the castle burned down slowly.
The morning sun came hours later, and Sylvester watched the fire in the distance as he made his way to another County with a different disguised face.
…
Over the coming weeks, Sylvester received the words from the Holy Land as he went from one castle to another and emptied their vaults with Miraj's sneaky skills. Only once was he caught by someone, but even then, he quickly solved the situation with a blade to the throat.
Just… that there were more than one throat, fifteen to be precise. Yes, he killed an entire bloodline to keep the secret and then burned the castles. But he didn't kill the kids as that would accumulate sin and enrage the Shadow Knight.
For some reason, the being had stopped chasing him, and he wanted to keep it that way.
"Maxy! Where to go next? I want more blood… I mean money!" Miraj roared like a lion while sitting on the head of Sylvester's horse.
Sylvester chuckled and rubbed the little white lion on the back. "Calm down now, Chonky. There are no lords left to loot. Anyway, how's your back? Is it still itchy?"
Miraj, as if suddenly remembering, began to scratch his back again with his legs. "I forgot I was itchy there. I think I got used to it."
'I hope it's nothing dangerous.' Sylvester still felt somewhat worried for him.
"Well, I'll give you a bath then. It'll heal you up."
"No!" Miraj jumped on his hind legs, his hair erect. "Maxy, don't worry. My tongue is very good. I can reach anywhere and make myself wet easily."
"..."
Seeing Sylvester so silent and with a blank face, Miraj realised his folly. "Did I say something suspicious again?"
Sylvester merely nodded. "You did. Just remember not to say those words in that order again. Let's return to the Wailing City now. Sir Dolorem and Bishop Lazark must be waiting for us."
"Aye, Aye!"
And so, their journey picked the pace, and they rushed to the South.
The effects of the earthquake that devastated the region a month ago had only started to surface properly now. Still, sadly, the one-month time limit that The Patch imposed on themselves for non-interference had already passed. The Widowmakers had once again become active, and the cycle of misery yet again continued.
Along the way, Sylvester found a few villages full of nothing but dead bodies. He reckoned they were the villages that got hit with the plague, and there was nobody to warn them that a plague had taken hold.
There were just hundreds of rotten bodies of men, women and children being eaten by birds and dogs alike. The smell of filth and death overwhelmed his senses, but Sylvester could not stop. He knew that good days were ahead as King Highland was nearly done with his dam construction.
In three days, he finally arrived at the Wailing City. But it looked much different now. The Inquisitor Army had arrived in full, so their flag was everywhere. Count Bradley and his army had also arrived but flew the Church's flag.
The site where Sylvester destroyed the castle was cleaned, and it was now merely an empty field with the monastery still intact. Above all, it appeared someone from the Holy Land had also arrived as Sylvester saw a carriage.
"How is the Archbishop?" Sylvester asked the first thing after arriving at the monastery.
Sir Dolorem, with a heavy heart and sorrowful face, shook his head. "Saint Medico is here — He believes the Archbishop won't survive this week."

Chapter 410 Enemies From Past
"Saint Medico is here — He believes the Archbishop won't survive this week."
Sylvester's shoulder fell, for he had come to like the old man. Archbishop Nelson was an honest man who had worked too hard for too long, and that was the reason for his undoing. His weak body was caused by his selfless service and desire to bring peace to the people.
"You said Saint Medico is here? For the plague, correct? Did he bring any helpers?" Sylvester inquired.
Sir Dolorem's expressions didn't get better, however. His eyes were covered, but the rest of the face was enough for Sylvester to discern something was wrong.
"He did… He brought two Void Keepers. He brought Spine and EX10 with him. Yes, you guessed it right, both of them were present in the Sphinx village. They are one of those who killed little Shane.
"Furthermore, EX10 is Bishop Lazark's elder brother. He's not too happy about EX10 being here with us." Sir Dolorem explained everything.
Sylvester sighed and decided to first meet the Archbishop. "Let's go inside. I wish to meet and give the Archbishop news that may revitalise him."
Sylvester moved into the monastery and headed to the sick bay. It was not crowded at all, and only some Bright Mothers were working there. There was also Mother Thena tending to the Archbishop.
"How are you, your grace?" Sylvester sat beside the Archbishop's bed.
The old man looked withered now, and his face had lost its colour. The cheerful side of his personality seemed lost, and even his smile appeared dead. He was so weak that he couldn't even speak.
The old man looked at Sylvester and raised his palm slowly. "Y-You h…have returned."
Sylvester held his hands. "I did it, your grace. The fifteen counts are dead. I received the word from the Holy Land as well. They have become serious about the Sorrow Kingdom and the plague. They sent Saint Medico here, and the Sorrow Kingdom will soon be under Holy Land's administration. I have also secured enough funds to feed the people for six months."
"D-Do not lie… Solis will p-punish."
Sylvester could understand why the man would not believe him. "Your Grace, I do not lie. Here, I have the letter with me. Look at this. It's the seal of the Pope. And you were unconscious, so you didn't see Saint Medico."
The Archbishop tried to get up from the bed, this time with a newfound strength. Feeling his dream so close that he could grasp it, he wanted to see it become a reality.
Sylvester helped the old man. "Be at ease, your grace. Your body is still too weak. The poison those heretics gave you tried to attack your nervous system. Thankfully, we had the cure here, but it still damaged your body."
The Archbishop still stood upright on his feet. "Don't waste time with such words, priest Johnathan. Please do not waste our time with such plebeian chatter. Our purpose is far too urgent for such trifles. The Holy Land is in dire need of our assistance, and as fate would have it, I am best suited for the task at hand. I possess an intimate knowledge of every inch of this cursed ground, and my web of contacts extends far and wide. Moreover, it was only those Nobles that I oversaw, for we stood on the same side while they plotted against me.
"But enough of that, come now, let us make haste and meet with Saint Medico. The fate of the Holy Land hangs in the balance, and it is up to us to ensure that the scales tip in our favour."
Sylvester's disguise was still up, so he silently followed the old man. Though he knew he'd soon be revealing his real identity as the main game was about to begin. Sorrow Kingdom, Highland Kingdom and all the way to Riveria, a fire was soon going to spread. A fire that shall burn many, but in the end, the one true puppet master would benefit the most. The hard work of years was soon going to show results finally.
Soon, Sylvester and the Archbishop arrived in the temporary office of Saint Medico. It was the biggest room in the monastery, and it was already filled with ceiling-high stacks of papers. Saint Medico was hard at work, writing something with both of his hands somehow. He'd dip the quill every few seconds and continue to write.
"Cardinal Charles." Archbishop Nelson weakly called.
Immediately, Saint Medico stood up and rushed to get the Archbishop to a seat. "Why did you get up, Nelson? You won't live even a day if you push yourself."
"Hah!" The old man laughed. "I've been prepared for death for years, Cardinal. I am now merely hopeful of seeing the Sorrow Kingdom free and flourishing before I take my last breath."
Saint Sceptre, Cardinal Charles Nos Leeds, knew that the old Archbishop would not give up. The man had spent his entire life working for the people of the Sorrow Kingdom, and the least he could do was show the man what he desired the most.
"Understood. Let's get to work then. I will start with the terrible news first. The plague is manufactured by someone, and it has already crossed over into the Highland Kingdom. We received the news of the first death there. I have alerted all monasteries in the Sol, so we shall receive updates regularly. The good thing is that making a cure is possible, even though it will take much time to develop."
Sylvester frowned, as the time was something they didn't have. "Saint, I wrote in my letter that The Patch might be behind this."
Of course, Saint Medico knew Sylvester was in disguise, so he respected his opinion. "I read that, but sadly, the matter is too political. We cannot simply accuse a quasi-Kingdom. We need proof, something we don't have. But, I still desire to meet with the Grand Wizard of The Patch, Vinland Markinson."
"He won't." Archbishop Nelson spoke. "He's a vile sadistic man. He'd rather watch the world burn than do something to quench the fire. His men are the people responsible for the misery in the Kingdom — Widowmakers, they call themselves. The Patch will ask for something in return for helping us, and we all know what they want."
Saint Medico sighed and nodded. "Of course, the Grand Duke of The Patch wishes to be crowned as the King of Sorrow."
Sylvester had the plan to tackle that, but he didn't want to reveal it to anyone yet as the walls had ears. So he stayed silent the entire duration of their conversation, which lasted a few hours. Ultimately, they decided to at least try and meet with Grand Wizard Vinland.
Sylvester's work was done, however. What he needed now was some time, and a few letters delivered.
He walked the long corridor of the monastery to go to his personal room, a very small one in size as his rank was 'low'.
"There he is!"
All of a sudden, Sylvester heard a feminine, cheerful voice. He turned around and saw a woman. The mere sight of her made him frown as a few veins popped up on his forehead. His fist clenched in itself, and his raging aura radiated as a flash of light on his fist.
"Hehe, he's angry. Come on, that was so long ago. We're friends now, aren't we?" She said. She was a slender woman, bright red-haired with two ponytails, wearing a pink noble gown too big for her size. She had red eyes and a cheerful personality, but all knew about her sadistic habits.
Sylvester scoffed. "Spine, the filthy one of the five Void Keepers responsible for Little Shane's death. I had taken him as my student, but you killed him. I only believe in an eye for an eye, and I shall have much more than a mere eye from you."
 "Oh! I'm so scared… Save me, this beautiful princess. Ah, wait, I can probably help you! Here, let me show you your dear student."
Woosh!
Spine was her codename, and her mastery was in illusion magic. So she created a scene around herself and Sylvester.
Sylvester's shoulder fell, for the scene Spine showed him was the moment he decided to actively work to become the Pope. Right before him, he saw yet again the crouched form of Shane's mother as she held Shane in her arms while the building around her burned. Her skin melted into Shane's as they both burned away in agony. The cries of pain, the mindless screams and the fading sobs… they rang in Sylvester's ears.
His fist tightened hard enough that his nails dug into his skin, making him bleed. His eyes rested on the melted blob of flesh that was Shane's mother, and the faint form of the little boy in the woman's arms.
Not wanting to see it more, Sylvester closed his eyes abruptly and started walking forward. Soon, he passed by the illusion of Shane and reached Spine.
Bam!
"Argh! Don't you dar—"
She tried to curse, but Sylvester clutched her neck tightly. She was a thin short woman, so he easily lifted her off in the air. She tried to kick her feet, but Sylvester only tightened his grip.
"You think you have the power over me?" Sylvester's eyes abruptly opened and shined in a dangerous red glow. "You think I don't know your little pesty games? I am an Archbishop of the Holy Land, the Cardinal Suprima here, and the Judge. Should I hereby declare you a heathen? I'd love to hear your screams. I wonder if you'd melt the same way as them."
"L-Let me go!"
Pa!
Sylvester used his other hand and slapped her hard on her face. Her right cheek instantly swole up in red, and she stopped fighting him.
"You little pest, by showing me that illusion, you revealed that you were there when he died — All of you actively killed that poor child. It was not an accident. It was an ungodly, shameful massacre."
"Ugk… I… I can't… Br—"
"I wonder how many said those same words to you, and you showed no mercy."
Thud!
Sylvester finally let her go by throwing her on the ground hard. He looked down at her, staring into her eyes with an inferno in his own eyes.
♫No longer your sins shall go unpunished.
It's the name of faith, you have diminished.♫
Against the norms, as his eyes stayed wide open while shining red, a similar red halo appeared behind his head. But, not warm; it was colder than the ice. It was the messenger of their sin's price.
Then abruptly, Sylvester turned around and proceeded to leave, but the halo remained.
♫In the name of Solis, I am the judge.
Your sins, I shall openly divulge.
Count your days and your breaths.
For none shall come to mourn your deaths.♫

Chapter 411 Bugles Of War
For the following day, Sylvester's mood was spoiled. He saw Spine and EX10 every now and then, and he could not do anything to them for the time being as they were under the official service of the church.
But it was not just him who felt frustrated. Bishop Lazark felt the same for EX10, his elder brother that he hated so much as the latter tried to secretly experiment on him by attempting to mutate him with a chameleon's blood. Of course, the experiment failed, but the relationship turned utterly sour following that.
With nothing else to do but wait, Sylvester decided to look for the cure for the plague. He knew what to look for. He just needed to seek it. So, after getting permission from Saint Medico, Sylvester ventured out into the Sorrow Kingdom with Sir Dolorem and Bishop Lazark. However, they changed their disguise again so no one could track their origin in the Wailing City.
"What do you feel about EX10?" Sylvester asked Bishop Lazark. "Would you mind if I killed him?"
"I'd rather kill him with my own hands." Bishop Lazark replied coldly. "He's a bane to society and stands against all the holy charters of the Church. He's only alive because he's useful, and I don't want him to remain useful."
"We have a common goal then," Sylvester responded, a sense of a dangerous aura looming over him. "I plan on killing him and Spine by the end of our current assignment. They are currently on official duty, and to stop them is akin to breaking the Holy Law. So once we solve this mess in Sorrow Kingdom, we will have a window"
"But… The Pope will not be happy." Sir Dolorem warned.
Sylvester mocked. "And I'm supposed to be happy when the church tries to kill my mother, get Shadow Knight chasing after me and kill my first student? They must accept my terms because there is only one me, while the Void Keepers can be replaced."
"And you're an Archbishop. Your words and demands carry a lot of weight. Just like how those other old men in the Council of Thirty-Two influence things with their power, you must do it too." Bishop Lazark suggested with an air of wisdom. "My old teacher used to say, 'It's foolish to let a fruit wither when you can eat it, even if you're not hungry.' Selfishness, far from being a vice, is oftentimes the very wheel that drives our ambition to greater heights."
Sylvester couldn't help but let out a small chuckle. "I never thought you'd be such a wise talker, Bishop. I don't see you often joining such conversations with us."
Bishop Lazark scratched his face under the black oversized hooded robes. "I… I merely wish for my brother to die. The longer he lives, the longer my family name gets spoiled."
Talking about family reminded Sylvester of something. He faced Sir Dolorem and, in all seriousness, offered something. "While we're at it, let's go to Foxholm village and kill the village Elders and the Baron responsible for the death of your wife and son, Sir Dolorem. I'm an Archbishop now, a Judge on top of that. Since a crime was committed, I can declare them heathens."
 Sir Dolorem went silent for a good ten minutes. His eyes were covered, so there was no way of saying if he was shocked, hopeful or sad. Sylvester still smelled it, and Sir Dolorem induced nothing but the scent of pure rage.
However, what he spoke went against what he felt. "That… Feels like a misuse of your authority, Lord Bard."
"Don't worry about such little things, Sir Dolorem. Every story needs an ending, and your story of vengeance is still incomplete. Don't you want to bring them to justice?" Sylvester insisted, as he wasn't scared of anyone anymore. He had a lot of pull in the Holy Land, and since Foxholm town was in the Highland Kingdom, Sylvester could just tell his wishes to King Highland, and the King would personally serve the heads of the village chiefs and the Baron on a golden platter.
Bishop Lazark moved his horse a bit closer to Sir Dolorem's and patted the willfully blind knight's back. "There is no harm in seeking vengeance, Sir Dolorem. The sin starts when you let the vengeance control you."
"Besides, we're the Church. We are the bringer of justice, the slayer of heathens. They harmed the family of an Inquisitor. That's a heresy in itself." Sylvester added, and whipped the horse lightly to move faster.
Sir Dolorem sensed Sylvester's fleeting back and felt a strange pull of string in heart. "H-He… He grew so fast."
Bishop Lazark sighed and looked ahead. "Let's be honest. He never had a childhood. Assassinations, duels, magic, praying and pain — that's all he has seen in his life."
Sir Dolorem bobbed his head in agreement, though his mind stayed turbulent. 'I hope he finds the peace he's searching for.'
"Ha!"
They, too, whipped the horses and rushed to catch up with Sylvester. They headed Northeast, where most cases of the plague were detected. Their destination was between The Last Hay village, where they had met Archbishop Nelson and Dying City, where they had met with the ex-baron Clofield.
Soon, they arrived in a small place called Jharl village. Boasting a population of nearly three thousand, and almost all of them were currently infected with the plague.
"What are we looking for in this place?" Sir Dolorem asked.
Sylvester kept looking left and right. "Anomalies! We must find a family that is still safe from the plague."
"And that will lead us to?" Bishop Lazark asked further.
"Cows!" Sylvester exclaimed. "Cow tits, to be precise."
"..."
Sir Dolorem, Bishop Lazark, and even Miraj stopped and just watched Sylvester. They wondered if all the pressure and the scorching heat of the Sorrow Kingdom got to Sylvester's head.
Sir Dolorem asked him. "Lord Bard, we wish to understand your whole plan first… please."
Sylvester turned around and noticed the two's faces, the scent of confusion and disgust. 'Ah! I made the Chonky mistake, it seems.'
"Well, it is exactly as I said. The cow tits are the solution to our plague." Sylvester added further but had no way of explaining the immunology, bacteriology, and virology to them.
"How can cow tits solve a plague?" Bishop Lazark inquired.
"Is it in the milk?" Sir Dolorem wondered.
Honestly, Sylvester didn't have it in himself to tell them what he was looking for. It was too disgusting for someone who had no idea about medicine.
"No, but close. Let's go now. Just ask around for any family that is completely fine. If we don't find one, we go to another village."
"Understood!"
…
While Sylvester tried to fight a plague, someone was facing much bigger battles. But it was a mess of his own concoction, and the consequences had finally caught up.
Inside the Grand Duchy of Patch, the massive, majestic castle stood mightily beside the Tame river. It was enormous, with two walls and moats around, and no town or village was nearby. It was constructed with the sole purpose of being impenetrable and safe.
But, as the schemes of the Grand Duke went on, the echoes of danger started to ring between the walls. After all, with enough strength, no walls were impenetrable.
Thud!
"Hypocrites!"
Thud!
"Bastards!"
Thud!
"Those sun fuckers! I asked them one thing — make me the King of Sorrow, and they still refuse!"
White-haired, blue-eyed, seven-foot-tall and clean-shaven — It was the Grand Duke of the Patch, slamming his fist on the table in his majestic solar in the castle. Victor Zee Maverick was the name of the man who brought the Sorrow Kingdom to ruins. The man who backstabbed his liege and left behind a trail of blood — Men, women and children, none were spared. He always struck when they were not prepared.
"Your majesty, even King Highland has begun to look our way." Spoke another man, young-looking this time—middle-aged, black stubbled bearded, short-haired, muscular, and a head shorter than the Grand Duke. "The river dam is nearly done. Once it's complete, he will stop our water supply, and we can't do anything for the dam rests within his territory."
Thud!
Rage was evident in the roars of the Grand Duke. "Then do something, you two! Einarr, you're a Grand Wizard and a Diamond Knight, and you, Vinland, you too. What are you two doing all this time? We're losing control over the Sorrow Kingdom now that the Holy Land has begun to act."
Vinland lowered his gaze as he was young and a mere nephew of the Grand Duke, a Grand Wizard himself. "Your majesty… I am trying to assess the situation. The Holy Land has sent Inquisitor High Lord to our northern borders. As we speak, the Inquisitors and the Holy Army are surrounding us from the north. Meanwhile, if the King Highland stops our water, then we will suffer from a mass drought."
"Haa!"
Boom!
Finally, Grand Duke Victor slammed his fist on the table hard enough and shattered it in pieces. His voice rumbled throughout the castle, and a strange red aura surrounded his body.
"I earned what I have! I didn't get the golden spoon passed down because of my blood — And I will not allow anyone to take what is mine. We still have many unfulfilled plans left, so set them in motion. The Highland Kingdom has been able to deal with refugees fairly well all this time, so let's show them what a real refugee crisis is.
"And Vinland, sound the bugle, ring the bells and let all know — It's time for war!"
"What about the Sorrow Kingdom, your majesty?" Einarr asked with his head held low and voice soft.
"Haha!" The Grand Duke laughed menacingly. "Send all those civilians who contract the plague here to the Sorrow Kingdom — Let them all rot together!"

Chapter 412 A Sad Sad World
Sand City, the Capital of the Highland Kingdom.
King Atrox Highland stood beside the river where a massive stone dam was constructed. It was the second of the two dams that he planned to build. One was already finished, and it rested in the middle segment of the river that passed through his land.
His reason for building the dam was not political but economical. As per Sylvester's suggestion, he planned to submerge some parts of the lands in his Kingdom that rested beside the river.
"Gladius, tell the builders to go with the plan. We need not wait for any permissions. Down south, only The Patch will be affected, for the Sorrow Kingdom has nothing left to lose now." King Highland ordered while proudly looking at his realm from a high tower.
Gladius Highland, the Prima of the King and the younger brother, seemed a bit worried. "My king, The Patch will wage war against us if we follow the plan. They have three Grand Wizards, while we have only you and the Queen."
"Hah! Don't worry about that, my little brother. Sylvester has promised that I will have to deal with only one of them, and he will take care of the rest. I am already at my peak, and no single Grand Wizard can truly defeat me, let alone me and my lovely wife combined." King Highland proclaimed.
Gladius sighed and shook his head. His face, full of worry, didn't change and only turned uglier. "Your Majesty, why do you trust that boy so much? He has no reason to be kind to us; in fact, he has every reason to resent what happened in Deserte Village after his birth. If not for Inquisitors, he would have been thrown in the fire and his mother rap—"
"Enough!" King Highland interjected with a forceful voice. "To this day, I still have nightmares pondering over what might have occurred. What if the Lord Inquisitor had not been there? … What if… We did a folly and allowed a vile heretic as Chief Deserte to rule. But now, I perceive young Sylvester as a son, even if he doesn't regard me as his father. Thanks to his remedy today, the kingdom possesses a young prince, and because of his deeds, we may well transform our desert kingdom, grappling with agricultural growth, into a realm of plenty.
"Do not worry too much, my brother. Place some faith in my capacity to gauge character. Young Bard is a person who honours and trusts those who reciprocate the same. Thus far, he has always kept his word, and I believe that the trust shall not be broken this time as well."
Gladius took a long breath and nodded. "I understand, your majesty. I shall go and inform the builders to block the river."
Soon, the King stood alone atop the tower and looked towards the South, at the Sorrow Kingdom. His face adorned with a big smile as he brushed his white beard. "Let's see what interesting miracles you show this time, Archbishop Sylvester. Will it be a quick step towards Cardinal rank, or perhaps… Saint? Ah, I feel excited now!"
…
Sylvester kept his search for the rare family going on for an entire week. He went from one village and town to another, looking for an anomaly. Sadly, it was hard to find in a world where information was not gathered anywhere. There was no registry that he could look at, and he had to go and ask around a lot.
Still, eventually, he found some leads, so, with newfound hope, he arrived at a new town called Magnuslia, named after its founder, Magnus the kind, a Baron who inherited his land at the age of thirteen but died a year later from a disease. He donated all his wealth and created the once-flourishing town of Magnuslia.
It was a town with a population of eight thousand, but only one thousand survived after the hunger and plague. But, even among the last thousand, nearly eight hundred were sick from the plague, and there was no hope of saving.
"Let's keep the disguise of clergymen here. I shall be an Archpriest, and you two shall be the same. We are here under the order of Saint Medico, who came to Sorrow Kingdom to help with the plague." Sylvester ordered Sir Dolorem and Bishop Lazark, who were officials of lower rank than him.
With the plan ready, they entered the town and started asking questions door to door. Since they were wizards, they had nothing to be afraid of. Sadly, it was hard to tell which homes were abandoned and which still had someone living in them. So oftentimes, they had to wait for a few good minutes before moving on. And sometimes, they'd find someone utterly weak and dying opening the door. They'd just sing a prayer to them and then move on.
They started in the morning, and eventually, it turned to night. But even by then, they had only searched one-fourth of the total houses. Tired, and somewhat bored, they tried to find a place to stay the night and continue the next day. After all, nobody was going to open the door at night for three strange men.
"That house has lights still on." Sylvester pointed at a much bigger house than usual and proceeded towards it.
Knock! Knock!
They waited for a minute.
Bam!
Sir Dolorem kicked the door this time to wake up the residents.
"Argh! Who in the holy Solis' name is disturbing this Baron!"
The door opened with a man grunting and shouting at them. However, as soon as the man glanced at Sylvester, he recognised them as he had seen their disguise previously.
Sylvester, too, was taken aback. "Ah, you're Baron Clofield! What are you doing here? You never replied again to Archbishop's orders."
'Fear? I smell too much of it. Is he hiding here from the Archbishop? But why?' Sylvester smelled a plethora of things, but the fear struck him the most.
The old Baron tried to control himself the best, but even Sir Dolorem and Bishop Lazark could see there was something wrong with his sweaty face.
"We shall rest here tonight." Sylvester didn't wait and barged into the house, shoving the old man to the side.
They went and took seats in the living room of the house. Sir Dolorem went to the kitchen and got water. They asked for nothing and took everything as if they owned it. All of them knew exactly what needed to be done — they were pressuring the old baron.
"W-What are you here for, priests?" Baron Clofield asked them as he rubbed his hands.
Sylvester told him the truth. "We're looking for a family that lives in a plague-hit region and is still completely fine. They might be the key to solving the plague."
Baron rubbed his chin and tried to think of someone like that. "There are still a few families left, but I believe most of them have someone in their family die from the plague. There could be someone fitting your description."
Sylvester looked left and right. "Where is little Amy? I hope she is fine if you brought that little bundle of joy to such a dangerous town."
"S-She is fine, my lord, just sleeping. I shall go and change into my normal robes. Then, I shall cook something for your humble selves." The Baron walked away quickly to his room.
Sylvester glanced at Sir Dolorem and Bishop Lazark and nodded. "Something isn't right. Start looking around, but don't act suspicious."
The other two nodded and stood up to look at things in the room. Then, they went to the kitchen in the name of cooking and started looking around. They looked for any clues, anything that could be related to blasphemy or some crime.
"Ah! Why are you troubling yourselves, priests? I shall cook for you. Please take a seat." The Baron soon returned in his usual robes and started putting things around frantically.
Sylvester nodded and stepped back to take his seat again. He started to talk, trying to scare the man. "The Holy Land has become serious about the Sorrow Kingdom. They might send the Holy Army and Inquisitors our way to control the situation."
'Ah, the fear increased. What the hell is he doing here?'
"I believe you should come with us to the Wailing City. It's our stronghold now." Sylvester offered.
"Ah, Priest Johnathan, I still have much work to do here and…"
"Umh…"
"Mister priest?"
 Sylvester, Sir Dolorem and Bishop Lazark's heads turned to the side. There, they noticed Amy coming out in her sleeping gown, rubbing her eyes and looking at them with interest.
Sylvester abruptly stood up, his eyes narrowing and veins appearing on his fist. He walked over towards Amy and knelt down to caress her head.
Then he faced the Baron, "Clofield, why is she coming out of the same room you went in?"
"Ah… I-I'm like a father to her, so…"
Woosh!
Sir Dolorem stood up, walked over to the Baron, and stayed beside him with one hand on the hilt of his sword. "Answer him… Honestly!"
"I-I am like her father…"
Sylvester continued to caress Amy's head while using magic to make his palm warm. He closed his eyes and tried to think with focus. He knew he wasn't going to like it, and he also knew that it was a crime too common in the world and time he lived in. But that didn't make it justifiable.
'Now I know why she was limping back then, and even now she…'
His eyes opened abruptly, wide and big. With no expression on his face, he uttered. "You had everything a commoner could envy, and yet, for no reason, you chose the path of a heathen."
"M-My… respected priests… There is a misunderstanding."
Sylvester shook his head and nodded towards Sir Dolorem. Then he sat in front of Amy, blocking the view and put his hands on her ears while she just stared at his face, tears automatically welling in her eyes, for the moment she had been waiting for had finally arrived.
Sylvester uttered his final words.
"Farewell — May the Holy Light guide you to hell!"
AN: See Amy on my Discord. I'd upload it here but I'm on a flight and only my mac has wifi.

Chapter 413 Cow Where
No more words were spoken, for they all knew their tasks. Sir Dolorem swung the blade like the scythe of the death itself. No time wasted, no questions asked, the sharp edges of the sword touched and pierced through the crying baron.
"No! Please... You are mistak--"
Thud!
Words had no meaning coming out of a man like him. The severed head fell on the floor with a sound, and the torso sprayed blood before taking a few steps back and dropping as well.
"I wish such heathens could be detected and terminated in their mother's wombs itself." Sir Dolorem commented, cursing nearly.
Sylvester didn't respond, as his priority was the girl who silently wailed. Her eyes watered down non-stop as she continued to stare at Sylvester's face.
Hoping to help, Sylvester decided to use his hymns and halo to soothe her heart. After all, most people consider him a god after seeing his halo. In Amy's case, she needed the confidence that God genuinely was there to help her.
â™«Let those tears fall once and for all.
Life awaits you, for you're still very small.
Hope for joy and love, for you're no longer a thrall.
Worry not; if evil returns, I shall be your wall.â™«
The warm halo behind Sylvester's head gave Amy much-needed warmth. Without embracing, she felt embraced. Without speaking to him, she felt she had known him her entire life. He was the one she waited for -- He was the one she prayed to -- He was God.
Sylvester stood up and held her small hands that were hardened from rough work. Then, without letting her see the bloodied floor and the baron's body, Sylvester brought her out of the house.
"You need not worry about anything from now on, Amy. You will come with me to the Holy Land and live happily. But first, let me ask, do you have any family? Parents or siblings?" He asked because the story the count gave before was too doubtful now. According to the Baron, Amy was the daughter of another Baron.
As he intently looked at her for a reply, he smelled her emotions. There was hope, fear, pain and worship. But, slowly, the sadness overcame all, and from that, Sylvester knew what her answer was going to be.
"They died, mister priest."
"Was he a baron as well?" Sylvester inquired.
The little girl nodded and continued to walk with Sylvester to what used to be the monastery in the town. It was now a rundown building with nothing but some dogs living inside.
Sylvester stopped asking her more questions as he didn't want her to remember the horrors again and again. He just requested Miraj if he had anything to make her feel better. Surprisingly, Miraj took out a lot of candies from his belly.
Soon, Sir Dolorem and Bishop Lazark finished chopping the Baron into pieces and throwing them out in the desert for animal food. That was the highest amount of disrespect one could face after their death. Not being burned in the fire meant the soul would never reach Solis. At least, that was what the faith believed in.
"What will you do with her, Priest?" Sir Dolorem asked him.
Sylvester glanced at the girl who was eating a candy silently. He remembered her face from the last meeting. It was so joyful. Alas, it was all a farce, and the current her was the real her.
"She's too young to walk this world alone. So she will live in the Bard's and get trained there while studying. I will pay for her education." Sylvester proclaimed.
Of course, Sir Dolorem and Bishop Lazark didn't object to the decision. They were men of the faith, and that was what they were supposed to do. Kids were too pure for the vileness that existed in the world and should be protected if seen in harm.
Seeing Amy's condition, Sylvester was reminded of the little girl from his visions, the princess of the Sorrow Kingdom. He wondered what sort of hellish torture she was facing. Not only that, the girl from the visions was even younger and weaker.
'Just for the sake of my mental peace, I should look for her at least.'
"Rest now. We will look for the cure tomorrow morning. Amy, you can sleep here. Nobody will come to hurt you anymore." Sylvester set up a small makeshift bed near the fire they had started for the little girl.
The little girl just nodded and followed his commands. She rested down on the small mattress and quickly fell asleep. She had cried too much, so her eyes were already tired. Combined with the fact that Sylvester seemed genuinely kind. She felt some peace of mind.
"Don't get too attached to her, Lord Bard." Sir Dolorem warned Sylvester as they sat around the fire.
Sylvester bobbed his head. He knew what Sir Dolorem meant. There were far too many kids out there possibly suffering from fates even worse than Amy's. He could not afford to become worried for all of them, as it'd take away all his time.
"I understand, Sir Dolorem. Child slavery is not yet outlawed, and there is nothing we can do about it. But to feel sad about these children means we are not yet so mentally unhinged. It's proof of our own humanity." Sylvester argued.
The old wizard knight agreed with him. "Certainly, you can look at it from this aspect."
Following the short discussion, Sylvester went to sleep. Amy slept the closest to the fire with the three clergymen surrounding her. She was the safest she could ever hope to be.
It was late in the night when they went to sleep, so the morning came too quickly. But they were strong men and required not much rest. With the bright light dawning over them, they rose, cleaned themselves and prepared to fulfil the rest of their task.
This time, Sylvester kept Amy beside him. She was nine years old or so, so that meant she could be tested for magic. But he didn't have any means for that yet. However, the fact that she travelled with the Baron to such a plague-hit area and yet remained safe meant she did have magic in her.
Knock! Knock!
Sylvester knocked on one door and waited until someone came. Eventually, five minutes passed, and finally, an old woman appeared, dragging herself to the door and opening it. She had blisters all over her face and hands. She seemed disoriented, her eyes red and her body thin.
Sylvester clapped his hands together and sang a short prayer to her before turning around and leaving in silence.
Amy ran behind him and quickly held onto his hand. "Why didn't we help her, mister priest?"
"She is infected with the plague. No cure can help her, so we don't trouble such people." He said and continued to another house.
Slowly, they covered most of the Magnuslia town, but then the night returned, and they had to rest again. That night, Sylvester sang a song for Amy and played his violin. He just wanted to make her forget everything that went bad in her past.
By the end of his song, her eyes shone, and her arms extended. "Can I play it? It was so beautiful!"
"Hah!" Sir Dolorem chuckled suddenly, for he knew what was to come next.
Sylvester gave her the instrument and taught her how to hold it. "Go ahead, give it a try."
"Yes!" She excitedly took a long breath, hoping to make a melodic sound by mimicking Sylvester from before.
Bzzzz!
Kzzzz!
She started sweating instantly, and an angry frown formed on her forehead. But she didn't stop and kept going, trying to copy what Sylvester did. Surprisingly, she was able to make it less ear-shattering, but it remained ear-shattering nonetheless.
"Why it sounds so bad?" She asked after finally giving up.
Sylvester took the violin back and taught her. "There are a few reasons why it sounded bad. First, you tried to mimic what you saw me doing but didn't have the same experience. Second, you press too hard on the strings, making a screeching sound. Third, you don't press hard enough, and it makes a squeaky sound. Even your bow, if incorrectly held, can make it sound bad. You master all these. Then you can play like me."
"C-Can I try again?"
"No, now you go to sleep. But you can practice it tomorrow." Sylvester, like a caring elder, made her go to sleep.
Slowly, the night passed again, and their boring day began. They had checked most of the houses in the central districts, and only those far-fetched homes were left. So they headed to meet the people there one by one. More people were alive there than in the central part of the town since the density was less in the outskirts.
Sylvester found the doors opening fast in the outskirts, but the disappointment was all he received. They were all either plagued or had someone in their family die from it already.
"Be safe, and here, keep some of these grains." Sylvester bid farewell yet again and handed a bag of grains. That was the least he could do as a clergyman.
"Let's go, Amy. To the next house."
Utterly tired and bored, they arrived at the last sector of the town. Their hopes were low, so not much enthusiasm was left in their eyes. They just automatically moved and knocked again.
"Priest! I found one!"
All of a sudden, just as Sylvester was about to knock on a door, Sir Dolorem appeared running and shouting.
 "A house where all members survived!"
Sylvester's tired eyes opened wide in an instant. He didn't even stop Sir Dolorem and just picked Amy before running towards Sir Dolorem and past him.
In no time, they arrived at the distant farmhouse. Bishop Lazark was already there, speaking with the whole family. There were three old grandparents, an adult man and a woman, along with three children aged five, ten and thirteen.
Sylvester calmed down as he approached them. "May the Holy Light Enlighten us!"
The man of the house stood at the front as if shielding his family. "Yes, what can I do for you, clergymen?"
Sylvester stared into the man's eyes and kept his senses sharp. "Do you, by chance, own a cow?"
"Of course, I'm a farmer."
Sylvester's hopes skyrocketed. "Can I see it?"
"Oh, but we ate it."

Chapter 414 The Cure
"You ate it?!"
The man of the family stepped back in fright from Sylvester's sudden reaction. He tried to clarify himself. "T-That… We had nothing else to eat back then, respected clergyman. Forgive us…"
Sylvester quickly calmed down and took a few steps back. "Don't be afraid, my brother in faith. I am not here to steal your food or such. I come in peace, looking for a cure to the plague by the orders of Saint Medico of the Holy Land. A few unique cows may have a naturally occurring substance that may cure the plague. Isn't that the case with your family? None of you has fallen to the plague yet."
The man and his family looked at each other's faces in confusion and some hope. They hoped Sylvester was right, which would mean they need not worry about the plague anymore.
"Clergymen, if you are fine, I have more cows in my barn. I am Benjamin, once the biggest dairy farmer in this region… before the invasion. You may look at them if you wish to."
Like a light bulb lit up on Sylvester's head, he walked straight into the poor family's house. "Show me the cows."
The family frantically led the way to the backside of the house, where a large wooden fenced field was situated. Benjamin opened the barn doors and led them all inside.
"Moo!"
Instantly, the cows looked at the noise. Yes, cows, as there were nearly five of them. But they all looked weak.
"We haven't been able to feed them well since the plague started. Before, we used to take them near the riverside so they could eat whatever was left of the grass there. We were planning on surviving on their meat this coming winter." Benjamin said, sorrow and fear evident in his voice.
Sylvester didn't reply as he was too busy inspecting the cows. He made a quick move and started to fondle the udder. He turned it and looked at all its sides one by one.
"W-What is he doing?" Benjamin asked Sir Dolorem in confusion. After all, the first thing Sylvester did was go for the cow's teats.
"Please be patient." Sir Dolorem had no idea either.
They watched Sylvester go from one cow to another and inspect their udder. He eventually did the same with all five of them and returned to the family with some questions.
"What I am going to ask you is utterly important. It is in the best interest of humanity that you answer me honestly. Did the cow you ate also have those blisters on the udder? Did you also eat the udder?"
"Y-Yes… We could not afford to waste any part of the body, not even the bones, for they could be used to make soup." Benjamin answered.
Sylvester rubbed his beardless chin and nodded. "Did any of you suffer from symptoms similar to the current plague in the past? Similar, but much less deadly."
The whole family silently thought about it. That was when the woman of the house exclaimed aloud. "Ah! Didn't Lareck have that a few months ago? Before the plague? He had a fever and blisters."
Sylvester faced the oldest of the children, thirteen merely. "I presume he is Lareck?"
"Yes, my oldest is Lareck. What is the matter, clergyman? Is everything alright? Did we do something wrong?" Benjamin felt tense and asked.
"Did you feel any symptoms resembling the current plague recently?" Sylvester asked further.
"We did for a few days, but it all disappeared. We thought we were going to die, but we survived. Since then, we have never gone out of the house." Benjamin replied truthfully, as he was still a believer and dared not lie with clergymen.
'Ah, so it's not as strong yet. But if I infuse some solarium in it, the trick should work.' Sylvester's mind raced with ideas.
Eventually, he decided to go on with the findings and report them back to Saint Medico. "You all are lucky. The blisters on that cow's udder are also a disease similar to the current plague. I call that Cowpox. It's a less violent version of the plague, so when you get infected with Cowpox, you develop immunity to the more extreme and dangerous plague."
Benjamin looked at his arm, where some small spots from the cowpox were still left. "The disease from the cow saved me? One disease saved me from another?"
"That's the magic of the human body, my friend. One's poison can be another's elixir. Now, we know that we have a cure. But we need to get it around the world to everyone. This will take a lot of effort and expertise. So here is my offer, you and your family can come with me to Wailing City, the current headquarters of the Holy Land inside the Sorrow Kingdom. There, you will find employment and food. Just bring your five cows along." Sylvester offered the man. He wished to show the cows and the family to Saint Medico as proof of the cure.
"We will come!" Benjamin responded in a split second. There was nothing left for them in the dying lands anyway. The prospect of work, safety and food was too enticing.
"Good, then start packing. We leave at dawn."
Sylvester left the family and proceeded to find a place to rest nearby. He felt much better, however, as he had found what he was looking for.
"Are you sure those ugly blisters will stop the plague?" Sir Dolorem inquired.
It was nobody's fault that they could not believe it. The world did not possess much knowledge about virology and immunology. To them, what they could not see with their eyes did not exist.
"It will, trust me. Let's just hope the Holy Land can mass immunise people because this isn't a cure but mere prevention. Once someone gets infected, there is no saving." Sylvester added, before finally closing his eyes.
However, he didn't sleep, for there was much to think about, much to plot and consider for his next steps.
…
For some, the plague was the greatest threat. For some, the discovery of its cure would have been the greatest news. But the talk of the town and wide around the Sol was something else.
King Highland finally finished building the twin dams on the Snake River, and without wasting any time, he deployed them to stop the river water. Effectively, he started submerging his lands in the water.
That effectively reduced the water levels further downstream on the Snake and the Tame rivers, both of which were important for The Patch. The entire reason The Patch used to be the bread and basket of the Sorrow Kingdom in the past was the river water. Without water, The Patch was no different from the Sorrow Kingdom.
Following the blocking of water by King Highland, The Patch sent many envoys to the Sand City to negotiate a deal with the wise, mighty King. But the King didn't budge and banned any more envoys from entering the Highland Kingdom.
Following that, slow escalations began to occur. Fishermen from the Highland Kingdom started getting attacked and killed, and cargo ships headed to the Highland Kingdom were looted. But none of that had any effect on King Highland.
Thanks to Sylvester, King Highland was able to form favorable and respectable relations with Riveria and Gracia, so the wounds The Patch tried to inflict didn't do much harm but rather only showed The Patch as the bigger aggressor.
The fact that the Holy Land was using information warfare to spread negative propaganda towards The Patch didn't help the Grand Duke either.
 So, with no more ways out, there was only one thing remaining.
In the year 5118 of the Lord, on the seventh month, Grand Duke Victor Zee Maverick, publicly made the call for full-scale war against the Highland Kingdom. Letters were sent, the coffers were checked, and the blades were sharpened.
Three Grand Wizards of The Patch to Two Grand Wizards of the Highland Kingdom. That was where all the confidence of the Grand Duke rested. However, neither he nor any other could realise that they were mere pawns in a great game that was being played out by someone they couldn't even imagine.
With pieces in place and the waves high, it was time to make the final moves.
…
Sylvester left for the Wailing City at dawn, just as planned. With multiple carts behind him, he escorted the family of eight carefully to the city in the south.
Thud!
Thud!
"Incoming!" Sir Dolorem roared.
Sylvester took out a sword and prepared to make contact with the enemies. Soon, he noticed an enormous horde of men approaching them on horses. All were wearing the red robes of Windowmakers, the scums who deserved to die.
'An ambush?'
"Prepare to strike! Benjamin, bring your family behind me!" Sylvester commanded and prepared to use his Wrath of Heaven's beam.
There were hundreds, and with their fluttering red capes, they appeared like a sea of blood. At the galloping speed of their horses, they charged forward.
"Ready!" Sylvester roared.
He tried to smell the scent, and all he sensed was rage. But then he noticed something strange.
'None of them have their swords out.'
Woosh!
Soon, the crowd of men reached them and, without reacting, just passed by as if they were in a rush. In no time, they left Sylvester and the rest confused and in a little cloud of dust.
"What was that?" Benjamin questioned in fright.
"They are retreating to The Patch." Sir Dolorem interjected. "It seems the war has begun."
Sylvester, however, could smell something else coming from a distance — the scent of death. It was so overwhelming that he could smell it from far away. That meant something tragic had happened.
"Move! Fast!"
Sylvester commanded and galloped his horse ahead, leaving behind Sir Dolorem and Bishop Lazark to escort the family.
He rushed closer towards the scent of death. Eventually, he saw smoke rising in the distance, so he knew what to expect.
"Maxy, I see something!" Miraj shouted while standing on Sylvester's head. "There is a lot of fire… So much fire."
Sylvester expected that already, but he needed to see it himself. So finally, after crossing the last few sandy hills, he appeared on the higher ground to see the view.
At the top of that hill, he stayed still on his horse, not saying another word or thinking. All there was to see was fire engulfing the entire Dying City and the towns surrounding it in the distance. From the beginning to the end, each and every structure was covered in fire, with the exits sealed shut.
"W-What is going on here?!" Sir Dolorem eventually arrived beside Sylvester and saw the scene.
Sylvester sighed and looked to the far distance, and similarly, he could see faint smoke rising in many directions.
"All troops of The Patch are returning to their homes, Sir Dolorem. But not before showing their true evil — they have opted to utilise scorched-earth — destroying all they find on their way back."

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, in this section, you learned about

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
automated testing and it's benefits. More specifically you learned

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
that it helps you refactor your code with confidence and

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
release software of better quality and with less bugs.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You learned about three types of tests, unit, integration,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and end-to-end tests. And you also saw a glimpse of unit

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
testing in action. You learned how to write a basic unit test in

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Visual Studio, and finally, you learned how to run and debug your

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
unit tests. In the next section, we are going to look at the core techniques

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
for writing unit tests. So, I will see you in the next section!
